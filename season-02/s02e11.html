[Introduction sequence]

Act I

(Camera pans an endless expanse of sand dunes and open sky. The wind blows
loudly around them. As the view swings to the right, Momo, then Katara,
then Sokka, Toph, and Aang come into view. Each looking in a different
direction. Aang is clearly still angry, and Toph appears forlorn. Aang
approaches Toph in an aggressive manner.)

Aang: (enraged) How could you let them take Appa‌ Why didn’t you stop
them‌
Toph: I couldn’t! The library was sinking! You guys were still inside and—

(Toph swings her arms wide.)

Aang: You could have come to get us! I could have saved him!
Toph: I can hardly feel any vibrations out here. The sandbenders snuck up
on me and there wasn’t time for—
Aang: You just didn’t care! You never liked Appa! You wanted him gone!

(Katara approaches the two in an attempt at peacemaking, and places an arm
on Aang&#x27;s left shoulder.)

Katara: Aang, stop it. You know Toph did all she could. She saved our
lives.
Sokka: Who’s going to save our lives now‌ We’ll never make it out of here.

(Camera swings to Sokka, who turns towards the others and motions to the
endless desert with an arm.)

Aang: That’s all any of you guys care about: yourselves! You don’t care
whether Appa is okay or not!

(Aang stalks off, sulking angrily.)

Katara: We’re all concerned, but we can’t afford to be fighting now.
Aang: I’m going after Appa.

(Aang flies off. Katara calls after him, running towards the spot from
which he took off.)

Katara: Aang, wait!

(Cut to a view of the sky, with a view of the crater where the Library had
been and Aang flying off.)

Katara: We’d better start walking. We’re the only people who know about
the solar eclipse. We have to get that information to Ba-Sing-Se.

(Camera, looking up towards the sun, returns to Katara, with Sokka visible
to the right. The group wanders out into the desert.)

Sokka: You think if we dig out the giant owl, he’ll give us a ride‌

(Cut to Zuko and Iroh. Scene changes to a close up of a cactus growing in
a clearly more lush environment. Camera swings to the right where we see
Zuko and Iroh on their ostrich-horse riding through a small cleft in the
valley. Iroh is clearly in discomfort.)

Zuko: Maybe we should make camp.
Iroh: (in a pained voice) No, please, don’t stop for me!

(Iroh lets out several more pained groans. Zuko pulls the reigns of the
Ostrich-Horse, stopping it. He and Iroh dismount. Iroh groans and takes a
seat on a large flat rock. The Ostrich-Horse perks up, pricking its ears.
Clearly, it detects something unusual. Zuko takes a defensive posture.)

Iroh: (annoyed) What now‌

(Rough Rhinos streak through the foliage around them. Col Mongke’s rhino
stamps the ground forcefully, breaking the surface crust. Camera swings up
to Col Mongke pulling back on the rhino&#x27;s reigns. Zuko continues his
defensive posture. Iroh brightens and places a hand on Zuko&#x27;s shoulder.)

Iroh: Colonel Mongke! What a pleasant surprise!
Mongke: If you’re surprised we’re here then the Dragon of the West has
lost a few steps.

(Mongke looks stern. He emphasizes his remarks by making sparks with his
bracers. His men ready their weapons.)

Zuko: You know these guys‌
Iroh: Sure. Colonel Mongke and the Rough Riders are legendary. Each one is
a different kind of weapons specialist. They are also a very capable
singing group.
Mongke: We’re not here to give a concert. We’re here to apprehend
fugitives!
Iroh: Would you like some tea first‌ I’d love some. How about you, Kachi‌
I make you as a jasmine man. Am I right‌
Mongke: Enough stalling! Round ‘em up!

(The dark skinned, pony tailed fighter swings his ball and chain at Iroh.
Iroh kicks the ball away. The ball, redirected, wraps its chain around the
foot of another warrior&#x27;s rhino. Iroh dodges the fire blasts by tumbling
along the ground. He rises back up to swat the rump of the rhino that had
been chained. The rhino runs off, yanking the dark-skinned warrior who had
one end of the chain attached to his belt as well as its own rider. Iroh
waves as he watches them go.

The archer shoots a lit arrow at Zuko&#x27;s back. Zuko senses the arrow,
turns, and breaks the arrow apart as it approaches him. Zuko then lets a
fire blast loose, which burns a hole in the archer&#x27;s bow, a hand’s width
above the archer&#x27;s hand. The blast passes through the bow and breaks the
string.

Mongke is seen letting loose fire blast after fire blast at Iroh. Iroh
deflects each. Zuko runs up and jumps on the back of Mongke’s rhino behind
him. A brief duel ensues, with Mongke quickly being kicked off the rhino
by Zuko.

Iroh runs up to the ostrich horse, jumps up on the saddle, and rides to
Zuko. Zuko jumps from Mongke&#x27;s rhino into the saddle as Iroh gallops by.

The armored warrior, riding in pursuit, throws a grenade at the fleeing
ostrich horse. The grenade explodes ahead of the ostrich horse, but Iroh
and Zuko are able to ride through the explosion.)

Iroh: It’s nice to see old friends.
Zuko: Too bad you don’t have any old friends that don’t want to attack
you.
Iroh: Hmm… Old friends that don’t want to attack me…

(Cut to Katara, Sokka, and Toph. Katara is seen leading the rest of the
crew, minus Aang and Appa, thought the desert. Occasional small plants dot
the dunes. They are clearly hot, dry, and tired. Sokka tries using Momo
and his wings as a hat. As he slows, Toph bumps into him, knocking Momo
off Sokka&#x27;s head.)

Sokka: (breathing hard) Can’t you watch where you’re—
Toph: No.
Sokka: Right. Sorry.

(Katara turns to encourage the others.)

Katara: Come on guys, we’ve got to stick together.
Sokka: If I sweat any more, I don’t think sticking together will be a
problem.

(Sokka tries to gently pull himself and Toph apart, but Toph cuts to the
chase and knocks Sokka down, disconnecting them.)

Toph: Katara, can I have some water‌
Katara: Okay, but we’ve got to try to conserve it.

(Katara bends water from her bag and suspends it between her and the
others. She then directs it to each mouth except her own. Sokka swishes
the water a bit, and then swallows with a face. He clearly is not
impressed with the taste.)

Sokka: We’re drinking your bending water‌ You used this on the swamp guy!
Toph: It does taste swampy.

(Cut to a shot of Momo smacking his lips before he lets out a displeased
burp. Katara motions her sense of helplessness.)

Katara: I’m sorry, it’s all we have.
Sokka: Not anymore! Look!

(Sokka makes a discovery, pointing to a large cactus a little off their
path. He walks up to it, cuts a piece off with his knife, and drains the
liquid content into his mouth. Momo does likewise.)

Katara: Sokka, wait! You shouldn’t be eating strange plants!

(Katara grabs Toph&#x27;s wrist and runs over to Sokka and Momo.)

Sokka: There’s water trapped inside these!

(Sokka holds up some cactus for Katara, but she backs away, pushing Toph
back as well.)

Katara: I don’t know…
Sokka: Suit yourself. It’s very thirst-quenching, though.

(The camera zooms in on Sokka&#x27;s left eye. The pupil dilates rapidly. The
camera backs away and we see Sokka&#x27;s expression become blank. He shakes
his head rapidly. The world then gets bizarre.)

Sokka: (In a strange, echoing voice) Drink cactus juice. It’ll quench ya!
Nothing’s quenchier. (moves across the sand like an inch worm) It’s the
quenchiest!

(Katara takes the proffered cactus bowl and pours it to the ground.)

Katara: Okay, I think you’ve had enough.
Sokka: Who lit Toph on fire‌

(Momo spins in a circle in the air and dive bombs to the ground.)

Toph: Can I get some of that cactus‌
Katara: I don’t think that’s a good idea. Come on, we need to find Aang.
Sokka: How did we get out here in the middle of the ocean‌
Katara: Uhhh…

(Cut to Aang, who flies across the desert on his glider and blows into the
bison whistle. He glides down and lands on a dune.)

Aang: Appa! Appa! (Stares across the horizon but sees nothing) No… NO!

(Aang slams his staff into the sand, creating a large mushroom cloud of
sand. Cut to a shot of the cloud from a distance as Katara, Sokka and Toph
climb over a dune. Dust that was kicked up blows over them.)

Katara: What is that‌
Toph: What‌ What is what‌
Sokka: It’s a giant mushroom! Maybe it’s friendly!
Katara: Let’s just keep moving. I hope Aang’s okay…
Sokka: (in the echoing voice from before) Friendly mushroom! Mushy giant
friend!

(Sokka waves his arms back and forth, and the music from the cactus juice
scene begins playing.

Cut to the ice spring from the oasis seen in “The Library”. The camera
pans to the left, showing various people standing around the ice spring.)

Man: Yeah, a little barefoot blind girl and her friends passed through
here a few days ago.
Master Yu: Did they give you any indication where they were headed‌
Man: Maybe you could give me a little incentive‌
Xin Fu: You suggesting I break your fingers‌
Man: They went in the desert! Too bad there’s almost no chance they
survived.
Xin Fu: That’s okay, since she’s wanted dead or alive.
Master Yu: No she’s not! I’m certain her father wants her alive.
Xin Fu: Hey, look… Fire Nation wanted posters!

(The camera changes to a view of several wanted posters on a bulletin
board. The middle poster has an illustration of Zuko and Iroh.)

Master Yu: So‌
Xin Fu: So, look who’s here.

(Xin Fu turns his head to look at Zuko and Iroh as they walk towards a
building.

Cut to Katara, Sokka, and Toph. It is now nearing sunset, and Katara,
Sokka, Toph and Momo are still trekking across the desert. A shadow passes
over head and Aang lands behind them, kicking up a small cloud of sand.
Katara approaches him as he kneels.)

Katara: I’m sorry, Aang. I know it’s hard for you right now, but we need
to focus on getting out of here.
Aang: (hopelessly) What’s the difference‌ We won’t survive without Appa.
We all know it.
Katara: Come on, Aang! We can do this if we work together. Right Toph‌
Toph: As far as I can feel, we’re trapped in a giant bowl of sand pudding.
I got nothin’.
Katara: Sokka‌ Any ideas how to find Ba-Sing-Se‌

(Sokka and Momo are both lying on their backs and staring at the sky.
Sokka smiles blissfully and points upward.)

Sokka: Why don’t we ask the circle birds‌

(Cut to a shot from below of several buzzard wasps circling above the
group. Katara looks left and right at everyone. Aang is still sulking, and
Toph staggers a bit.)

Katara: Ugh… We’re getting out of this desert, and we’re going to do it
together! Aang, get up. Everybody hold hands. We can do this. We have to.

(Katara takes Aang’s staff and leads him along. Aang holds on to Toph’s
hand, and Toph holds on to Sokka’s hand. Sokka smiles and laughs as he
pulls Momo along by the tail. Momo is trying to fly in the opposite
direction. Shift to a shot from above as the group walks through the
desert. A few buzzard wasps fly across the screen.

Cut to commercial break.)

Act II

(Fade in to a shot of the sun setting behind an old, withered tree. Stars
have appeared in the sky. The camera pans right and shows Katara leading
the group over the top of a large dune.)

Katara: I think we should stop for the night.

(Everyone behind Katara sighs and falls to the ground.)

Toph: Is there any more water‌
Katara: This is the last of it. Everyone can have a little drink.

(Katara opens her water flask and bends out an orb of water. Momo leaps at
the water and tries to drink it, causing it to fall to the sand below.
Sokka panics and scrambles towards the wet spot in the sand.)

Sokka: Momo, no! You’ve killed us all!
Katara: No, he hasn’t.

(Katara places her hand over the moist sand and bends the water out of
it.)

Sokka: Oh, right. Bending.

(Katara bends the water back into the flask and gives it to Toph.)

Katara: Sokka, let me see the things you got from the library.

(Sokka reels back and clutches his bag full of scrolls.)

Sokka: (offended) What!‌ I didn’t steal anything! Who told you that‌
(pointing an accusing finger at Momo) It was you! You ratted me out!
Katara: Sokka, I was there. (takes Sokka’s bag)
Aang: It doesn’t matter. None of those will tell us where Appa is.

(Katara pulls out one of the scrolls and unrolls it, revealing a star
map.)

Katara: No, but we can find out which way Ba-Sing-Se is. We can use the
stars to guide us. That way we can travel at night when it’s cool and rest
during the day. (She sighs.) Just try to get some sleep. We’ll start again
in a few hours.

(Cut to Zuko and Iroh. The camera fades to inside the bar at the ice
springs. Zuko and Iroh are sitting at a table.)

Zuko: No one here is going to help us. These people just look like filthy
wanderers.
Iroh: So do we. (pointing) Ah, this is interesting. I think I’ve found our
friend.

(The camera cuts to a pan left shot of an old, bald man sitting at a Pai
Sho table.)

Zuko: You brought us here to gamble on Pai Sho‌
Iroh: I don’t think this is a gamble.

(Iroh and Zuko get up and walk over. The camera closes in on Xin Fu and
Master Yu sitting on a bench and watching the two fugitives.)

Xin Fu: Let’s take them now!
Master Yu: This place is full of desperate characters. If they find out
we’re collecting a bounty, we might have to fight them all just to keep
our prize. Patience.

(Cut to a shot of Iroh and Zuko approaching the Pai Sho table.)

Iroh: May I have this game‌
Pai Sho Player: The guest has the first move. (Iroh places the lotus tile
in the middle of the board) I see you favor the white lotus gambit. Not
many still cling to the ancient ways.

Iroh: Those who do can always find a friend.
Pai Sho Player: Then let us play.

(The old Pai Sho player places another tile on the board. Iroh quickly
places another tile as well. Zuko sits down and watches intently as the
two men place tile after tile on the board in rapid succession. When they
are done, the tiles form the shape of a lotus, with the lotus tile in the
center.)

Pai Sho Player: Welcome, brother. The White Lotus opens wide to those who
know her secrets.
Zuko: What are you old gasbags talking about‌
Iroh: I always tried to tell you that Pai Sho is more than just a game.

(Iroh rolls a tile over his knuckles and clutches it. Cut to a shot of Xin
Fu and Master Yu.)

Xin Fu: I’m not waiting all night for these geezers to finish yapping!
It’s over! You two fugitives are coming with me!
Pai Sho Player: I knew it! You two are wanted criminals with a giant
bounty on your heads!
Zuko: I thought you said he would help!
Iroh: He is. Just watch.
Pai Sho Player: You think you’re going to capture them and collect all
that gold‌
Man in bar: Gold‌

(All of the men in the bar look up at the mention of the word ‘gold.’
Several of them pull out knives and approach the group around the Pai Sho
table.)

Master Yu: Uh… Maybe we shouldn’t.

(Two men jump in front of Xin Fu. The earthbender spins around and
delivers a reverse roundhouse kick, bending a rock from the ground which
knocks the two men away. Master Yu enters his stance and bends the earth
underneath one of the assailants, causing him to sink into the ground up
to his neck.

Cut to a shot of Xin Fu handling a group of sandbenders. He has one lifted
in the air with one hand and holds back another sandbender with the other
hand. Xin Fu promptly kicks any other sandbender that comes near. He
twists his waist and throws the two sandbenders he’s holding. One goes
flying and smashes into the wall behind the bartender.

Cut to a shot of Zuko, Iroh and the Pai Sho player running out of the
building. Cut back to Xin Fu and Master Yu in their stances. They have
both knocked out nearly everyone in the bar, but have let their bounty
escape. Xin Fu growls and punches both of his fists downward, causing a
pillar of rock to shoot out from under one of the downed sandbenders. He
yells as he flies through the window and hits a palm tree.

Cut to Aang’s group. The camera pans left to the group sleeping on a dune.
Momo is burying the dreaming Sokka under the sand and patting it down.
Momo jump away as Katara approaches Sokka to wake him up.)

Katara: Come on, get up. We need to go.

(Sokka drowsily sits up. Toph sits up and smacks her lips.)

Toph: Yesterday my mouth tasted like mud. Now it just tastes like sand. I
never thought I’d miss the taste of mud so much.

(Katara goes to wake Aang up, but he interrupts her before she can touch
him.)

Aang: I’m awake. I couldn’t sleep.
Katara: Well, we need to get moving if we want to get out of this sand
pit.

(Aang and Katara spot something in the sky. Cut to a shot of a large,
bison shaped object floating past the large, bright moon.)

Aang: (joyfully) Appa!
Sokka: Appa‌ But why would Princess Yue need him‌ She’s the moon! She
flies by herself!

(A closer look at what was thought to be Appa reveals it to be nothing
more than cloud.)

Katara: (sadly) It’s just a cloud. Wait! A cloud! (To Aang) Here, fly up
and bend the water from that cloud into my pouch.

(Aang gives Katara an angry look before snatching her water pouch and
taking off on his glider. In two passes, Aang quickly collects the cloud
moisture. He throws the pouch down to Katara and lands. Katara peeks into
the pouch.)

Katara: Wow… there’s hardly any in here.
Aang: (angrily) I’m sorry, okay! It’s a desert cloud; I did all I could!
What’s anyone else doing! What are you doing‌

(Aang points his staff at Katara. She looks back with shock.)

Katara: Trying to keep everyone together. Let’s just get moving. We need
to head in this direction.

(Katara begins reading the star map and continues to lead the group. After
a few moments of walking, Toph suddenly trips and falls. She rubs her
stubbed foot. Next to her is a wooden object sticking out of the sand.)

Toph: Ow! Crud! I am so sick of not feeling where I’m going! And what
idiot buried a boat in the middle of the desert‌
Katara: A boat‌
Toph: Believe me, I kicked it hard enough to feel plenty of vibrations.

(Sokka sighs as Aang steps forward and swings his staff in a wide,
horizontal arc, kicking up sand. When it clears, a sand glider like the
ones used by the sandbenders is seen.)

Katara: It’s one of the gliders the sandbenders use! And look! It’s got
some kind of compass on it! I bet it can point us out of here! Aang, you
can bend a breeze so we can sail it. We’re going to make it!

(Everyone turns to see Sokka laughing and as he buries Momo in a pile of
sand. He turns towards the others and gives two thumbs up as well as a
large grin.

Cut to Zuko and Iroh.

Fade to a shot of a small village near the edge of the desert. Zuko, Iroh
and the Pai Sho player from the ice springs enter one of the buildings.
The Pai Sho player makes sure than no one is watching before shutting the
door. Inside it becomes apparent that the building is a flower shop.)

Pai Sho Player: It is an honor to welcome such a high-ranking member of
the Order of the White Lotus. Being a Grand Master, you must know so many
secrets.
Zuko: Now that you played Pai Sho, are you going to do some flower
arranging, or is this club going to offer some real help‌
Iroh: You must forgive my nephew. He is not an initiate and has little
appreciation for the cryptic arts.

(The Pai Sho player knocks on a door in the back. A small window in the
middle slides open and a man peeks through.)

Doorman: Who knocks at the guarded gate‌
Iroh: One who has eaten the fruit and tasted its mysteries.

(The door is opened and Iroh and the Pai Sho player enter. Zuko attempts
to follow them, but the door is shut in his face. Iroh slides open the
door’s window.)

Iroh: I’m afraid it’s members only. Wait out here.

(Zuko frowns and crosses his arms. He leans over to a nearby plant and
sniffs it.

Cut to Aang and company. Fade to a shot from above of the sand glider
racing through the desert. Aang is driving it forwards by bending powerful
gusts of air into the sail. Katara is standing on the upper platform and
navigating using the compass and star map.)

Katara: The needle on this compass doesn’t seem to be pointing north
according to my charts.
Sokka (dreamily): Take it easy little lady. I’m sure the sand folks who
built this baby know how to get around here.

(Sokka is sitting behind Katara and holding Momo by the tail. Katara gasps
when she sees a giant rock sticking out from the sand in the distance.)

Katara: (gasps) That’s what the compass is pointing to! That giant rock!
It must be the magnetic center of the desert.
Toph: (happily) A rock‌ Yes! Let’s go!
Katara: Maybe we can find some water there!
Aang: (darkly: Maybe we can find some sandbenders.

(Fade to a shot of the sand glider at the foot of the rock. It is now dawn
and the sun brightens part of the sky. The camera rotates up to a view of
Aang and the group reaching the top of the rock.)

Toph: Ahhh… Finally! Solid ground!

(Toph falls flat on her back and moves her arms and legs back and forth,
creating an earth angel in the rock surface. Cut to a shot from above. The
camera zooms out and several strange, round caves can be seen. Shift to a
shot from the inside of one of these caves as the group enters it. Covered
all around the cave’s surface is a yellow, gooey substance that looks like
honey.)

Sokka: (breathes deeply) I think my head is starting to clear out the
cactus juice. And look!

(Sokka grabs some of the sticky substance and he and Momo eat it. He
quickly spits it out and makes a disgusted gagging noise.)

Sokka: This tastes like rotten penguin meat! Awww I feel woozy.
Katara: (irritated) You’ve been hallucinating on cactus juice all day and
then you just lick something you find stuck to the wall of a cave‌
Sokka: I have a natural curiosity.
Toph: I don’t think this is a normal cave. This was carved by something.
Aang: Yeah… look at the shape.
Toph: There’s something buzzing in here. Something that’s coming for us!

(The camera cuts to a view of everyone running back out of the cave as a
buzzing noise is heard. The camera zooms out to reveal a large domed
structure which resembles a hive carved from the rock. Toph and Aang
scream as buzzard wasps fly from the caves and attack. A buzzard wasp
lunges at the camera.

Cut to commercial break.)

Act III

(Fade in to a shot of the giant rock. Change to a shot of the buzzard wasp
hive at the top. Several of the creatures emerge from the cave and begin
flying above and screeching. Aang swings his staff down at one that
approaches and blows it back with a gust of air. A buzzard wasp lands near
Toph. She senses it and bends a pillar of rock up from beneath it, sending
it flying.

Another buzzard wasp flies between Toph and Sokka. Toph stomps the ground
and pops a boulder into the air. She lifts it and smashes it down inches
away from Sokka.)

Sokka: What are you doing‌ That rock almost crushed me!
Toph: Sorry, I can’t tell where they are in the air!

(A buzzard wasp flies past them.)

Sokka: I got this one.

(Cut to a shot of Sokka swinging his machete wildly back and forth.)

Katara: Sokka, there’s nothing there.

(The camera zooms out to show Sokka looking back and forth, realizing he’s
been attacking the air.)

Sokka: I guess my head’s not as clear as I thought.
Katara: We have to get out of here! I’m completely out of water to bend!

(The camera cuts to a shot of Momo crouching on the ground behind Aang and
Katara. He is suddenly snatched by a buzzard wasp. Aang watches as the
wasp flies towards the rising sun with the winged lemur.)

Aang: Momo! I’m not losing anyone else out here.

(Aang opens his glider and takes off after the buzzard wasp.)

Katara: Come on, we’re going down.

(Cut to a shot of the giant rock’s wall. Buzzard wasps are flying
everywhere. The camera rotates down to a view of Sokka, Katara and Toph
making their way down on a narrow ledge. Katara places her hands on Toph’s
shoulders and turns her to face the buzzard wasps.)

Katara: Toph, shoot a rock right there. Fire!

(Toph stomps down and pops a cluster of rocks into the air before shooting
them forward with a double palm strike. The rocks make a direct hit with
the buzzard wasp.)

Sokka: Yeah! You got it! She got it, right‌
Katara: Yes. Now let’s move.

(Shift to Aang chasing the buzzard wasp that has captured Momo. He flies
underneath it and rolls over, bending a gust of wind with a strong kick
that forces the buzzard wasp to let go of Momo. Momo begins to fall, but
quickly gains control and flies next to Aang. Aang glares as the Buzzard
wasp tries to fly away. He glides close to the ground and closes his
glider. Still flying forward, Aang swings his staff down and shoot a
powerful blade of air that splits the sand. The buzzard wasp, now just a
black dot against the sun, is hit by the attack, cutting it in two. It
falls from the air and hits the sand with a dull thud. Aang stares coldly
and walks back to the giant rock. Momo follows, but is clearly frightened
by Aang’s merciless act.

Cut back to Katara, Sokka and Toph nearing the bottom. Katara turns to the
camera.)

Katara: On your left!

(Toph smacks a rock and shoots it at another buzzard wasp, which shrieks
on impact. The camera cuts and zooms out to a wide shot of buzzard wasps
hovering around the foot of the rock and the sand glider. Suddenly,
gigantic pillars of sand burst upwards, scaring of the swarm of wasps.
They fly upward and back to their hive. Sokka, Katara, and Toph all shield
their eyes. When they open them, several sandbenders are surrounding them.
The camera pans over them and their gliders. Shift back to Katara, Sokka
and Toph as Aang lands in front of them, ready to face the sandbenders.

The scene changes to a shot of the flower shop. Cut to Zuko inside, who
appears to have fallen asleep while waiting. The door opens and Iroh steps
out, causing Zuko to awaken and go into a defensive stance.)

Zuko: What’s going on‌ Is the club meeting over‌
Iroh: Everything is taken care of. We’re heading to Ba-Sing-Se.
Zuko: Ba-Sing-Se‌ Why would we go to the Earth Kingdom capital‌
Pai Sho Player: The city is filled with refugees. No one will notice two
more.
Iroh: We can hide in plain sight there. And it’s the safest place in the
world from the Fire Nation. Even I couldn’t break through to the city.

(The door opens and a man steps inside the flower shop.)

White Lotus Member: I hate the passports for our guests, but there are two
men out on the streets looking for them.

(Cut to a shot of Xin Fu and Master Yu standing outside from behind the
small window in the door. Xin Fu holds up a wanted poster to a man walking
by.)

Xin Fu: You seen these guys‌

(The camera zooms out to show Iroh and Zuko looking through the window.
They turn to each other and give each other questioning looks.

Cut to Aang and the gang. The leader of the sandbenders, a bald man with a
beard confronts Aang, Katara, Sokka and Toph.)

Sha-Mo: What are you doing in our land with a sandbender sailer‌ From the
looks of it, you stole it from the Hami tribe.
Katara: We found the sailer abandoned in the desert. We’re traveling with
the Avatar. Our bison was stolen and we have to get to Ba-Sing-Se.

(A younger sandbender next to the leader steps forward and raises his
voice and clenches his fist.)

Sandbender #1: You dare accuse our people of theft while you ride in on a
stolen sand sailer‌

Cut to a close up of Toph’s eye narrowing when she hears the young
sandbender’s voice.

Sha-Mo: Quiet, Gashuin. No one accused our people of anything. If what
they say is true, we must give them hospitality.
Gashuin: Sorry, father.

(Toph’s eye widens upon realization of who the young sandbender is.)

Toph: I recognize the son’s voice. He’s the one that stole Appa.
Katara: Are you sure‌
Toph: I never forget a voice.

(Aang takes several steps towards the sandbenders and brandishes his staff
threateningly.)

Aang: (angrily) You stole Appa! Where is he‌ What did you do to him‌
Gashuin: They’re lying! They’re the thieves!

(Aang swings his staff down and obliterates a sand sailer with a blast of
air.)

Aang: Where is my bison‌

(The scene changes to outside the flower shop Iroh and Zuko had stayed in.
Out of the door steps a man pulling a small wood wagon with two large
flower pots on it. After he leaves, Xin Fu and Master Yu approach the
door. Cut to the interior of the flower shop as Xin Fu burst the door
open. This causes a flower pot hanging overhead to fall and shatter. Xin
Fu holds up the wanted poster to the florist tending the plants.)

Xin Fu: Hey you, where are these men‌ I got a tip that they’re in your
shop.
Florist: (calmly) As you can see, no one is here but us.
Master Yu: We know all about your secret back room. (to Xin Fu) Kick it
down.
Florist: Hey! That room is for flowers only!

(Xin Fu runs at the door and slams his foot into it, knocking down the
whole doorframe and the stone around it. Xin Fu and Master Yu discover the
room to be empty, save for a circle of mats and a Pai Sho lotus tile in
the middle. Master Yu picks up the lotus tile.)

Master Yu: Some unlucky soul has an incomplete Pai Sho set.
Xin Fu: (Growls angrily and knocks the tile out of Master Yu’s hand) Let’s
go back to finding the girl.

(The scene changes to the man with the wagon pulling the two large pots
over some sand dunes just outside the village. From under the flowers in
the two pots, Zuko and Iroh poke their heads out and take a brief look
around before sinking back into their hiding spots.

Cut to Aang and the others. The scene changes to Aang and the
sandbenders.)

Aang: You tell me where he is now!

(The sandbenders watch in shock as Aang swings the end of his staff upward
and destroys another sand sailer.)

Sha-Mo: (To Gashuin) What did you do‌
Gashuin: I-It wasn’t me!
Toph: You said to put a muzzle on him!
Aang: (enraged) You muzzled Appa‌

(Aang’s eyes and arrow glow as he begins to enter the Avatar state. He
twirls his staff around and demolishes one of the few remaining sand
sailers.)

Gashuin: I’m sorry! I didn’t know that it belonged to the Avatar!
Aang: (In an unearthly voice) Tell me where Appa is!
Gashuin: (frightened) I traded him! To some merchants! He’s probably in
Ba-Sing-Se by now! They were going to sell him there! Please! We’ll escort
you out of the desert! We’ll help however we can!

(The air around Aang slowly begins to pick up and spin around Aang as he
fully enters the Avatar state, pulling in sand and creating a small
tornado.)

Sokka: Just get out of here! Run!

(Sokka grabs Toph by the shoulders and pulls her away from Aang. Toph,
Sokka, Momo and the sandbenders all flee for their lives. Katara, however,
stays and faces the danger. The sand tornado grows larger and spreads
quickly as Aang slowly lifts from the ground. Katara makes her way through
the fierce wind and grabs Aang’s wrist. He looks down at her with anger
and hate, but is only met with Katara’s sad expression. Katara brings Aang
back to the ground and hugs him by the shoulders. Sokka and Toph bring
their hands down from shielding themselves as the wind becomes less
violent. Tears are streaming from Aang’s glowing eyes, and Katara is doing
her best not to let go of him. The wind finally dies down. Aang leaves the
Avatar state and lets his head rest against Katara. The screen fades to
white.)

我们得把这个好消息带到永固城去
如果咱们把那个大猫头鹰挖出来
它会不会载咱们一程以示报答
不如咱们停下来露营吧
不用了
不用担心我
真是不得清静
蒙科上校
(听起来像猴子上校)
是哪阵风把您吹来了？
就凭您西方神龙大将军的智商
能猜不出我们干啥来了？
你认识这些家伙？
当然
蒙科上校和他的莽骑兵
曾是风靡一时的风云人物
他们每个人都身怀绝技
而且还是个很有名的歌唱组合呢
我们可不是来开演唱会的
此行是为抓捕逃犯而来
你们不想先喝杯茶吗？
我可是想喝了
“喀哧”，不喝一杯吗？
我猜你肯定爱品茉莉吧
我没猜错吧？
别耍贫嘴了
把他们给我围住
能见到老朋友真好
可惜你的老朋友没有几个不想杀你的
嗯，不想杀我的老朋友...
你怎么走路不长...
什么？
算了
抱歉
快走伙计们，咱们可别走散了
如果我再出汗的话
跟你们粘在一起应该就不成问题
（stick together，又一处索卡式的幽默）
卡塔拉，给我点水喝吧
好吧，不过我们得省着点了
你不是把御术用的水给我们喝了吧
这水可是在沼泽男的身上用过的
一股沼泽味
抱歉，咱们只有这些水了
有补给了！看哪！
索卡，等等
不要乱吃那些奇怪的植物
这些植物很会存水哩
还是不喝为妙...
尝尝看
那是相当的解渴啊
喝口仙人掌汁，管保你止渴
没有比它止渴的了
最能解渴的就是它了
好了，我看你是喝高了
谁把拓芙给点着了？
我能喝点那个仙人掌汁吗？
可别，一个索卡就够我受的了
快走吧，咱们得找到安昂
咱们跑到大洋中间来干什么？
阿柏
阿柏
不
不
那是什么东西？
什么什么东西？
是个大蘑菇！
没准它很友好呢
咱们继续赶路吧
希望安昂能平安
友好的蘑菇！
多愁善感的大朋友
（mushy：多愁善感
mushroom：蘑菇）
没错，是有个光脚的盲丫头来过
同行的还有她的几个朋友
那是几天前的事了
他们没说要去哪儿吗？
那就看您的诚意如何喽
你看把你的手指都掰折
够不够诚意啊？
他们进沙漠了
他们没有可能生还的
对了，她爹是生要见人死要见尸吗？
死的谁要啊
她爹肯定是要活的

嘿，看哪
火宗的悬赏告示
那...
那你看看谁来了
我很抱歉，安昂
我知道这话可能有点残酷
但是我们现在应该集中精力找路出去
费什么劲，没有阿柏咱们
根本就没法活着出去
这是明摆的事
振作点，安昂
我们需要齐心协力
对吧，拓芙？
依我看
咱们是陷在一大碗沙做的布丁中了
我无能为力
索卡，知道怎么能找到永固城吗？
为啥不问问
在我头上盘旋的那些小鸟呢？
呃...我们要走出沙漠
让我们一起加油吧
安昂，快起来
大家都把手握起来
我们能行的
我们别无选择
我想咱们应该停下来过夜了
还有水吗？
就剩最后这点了
每个人都能分一点
模模，你要害死大家了
不要紧，没那么糟
哦，差点忘了
你会御术啊
索卡，把你从图书馆中
带出来的东西让我看看
什么？我可什么都没偷
是谁告诉你的？
肯定是你，你居然出卖我
索卡，我当时在场
没用的
那些东西不会告诉我们阿柏在哪儿的
是不会，不过可以指引我们找到永固城
我们可以让星星指引我们
我们可以趁夜里凉爽的时候赶路
而在白天的时候休息
多睡一会儿吧
几个时辰以后启程
这没有人能够帮我们
这些人全都是肮脏的流浪者
我们不也是吗
啊~
啊，太好了
我想我找到朋友了
咱们来这儿不是就为了赌局牌手吧
这可不是什么赌博
咱么这就逮了他们吧
这地方可全都是不顾死活的主儿
正所谓双拳难敌四手
好汉架不住狼多啊
我可不想让他们跟咱争赏金
稍安勿躁
能和您玩一局吗？
请客人先行
看来你喜欢用白莲来开局啊
已经好久没人用这种古法下棋了
用古法下棋的人总能觅得知音
咱们开始下吧
欢迎你，兄弟
白莲永远向知晓它秘密的人盛开
你们两个废话连篇的在唠啥呢？
我不是一直跟你说嘛
牌手并不仅仅是个游戏而已
我可没有闲功夫看这些老头整夜打哈哈
投降吧！
你们两个逃犯哪里逃！
我就知道
你们两个就是赏金万两的通缉要犯
你不说他会帮咱们吗？
他是在帮忙
等着看好戏吧
你们两个是不是想抓住他们
然后独享那笔黄金
黄金？
嗯，还真让你给说着了
来吧，都起来吧
咱们得赶路了
昨天我嘴里还是一股泥味呢
到今天就只剩下沙子味了
没想到我会那么怀念泥巴的味道
我醒着呢，一直睡不着
如果我们想走出这个沙坑就得赶快动身了
阿柏
阿柏？月公主怎么会需要它呢？
人家可是月神啊，她自己就会飞
只是朵云啊
等等！你说云？
拿着，飞上去对云用御水术
往这袋子里弄点水
哇哦，怎么这么少啊
对不起总行了吧
那可是沙漠上的云，我已经尽力了
你们其他人又做了什么？
你又做了些什么？
我试着让大家团结在一起
咱们还是上路吧
应该朝着这个方向走
哇哦！真倒霉
不知道该往哪走的感觉真不爽
这是哪个白痴在沙漠里埋了艘船啊
一艘船？
相信我，这脚我踢的很实诚
我的确感到震动了
这是那些御沙者用的砂舟
看哪，这上面还有像罗盘一样的东西
我敢打赌，它肯定能给我们指明出路
安昂，用御术送点微风出来
这样咱们就能滑行了
咱们一定能走出去的
能接待您如此高级的白莲教成员是我的荣幸
作为一位大师，你一定知道很多秘密吧
你们玩的那个牌手游戏
该不是为了花卉交易打掩护吧
这教会能不能提供点实惠的帮助啊？
请原谅我的侄子
他还没有入会
对这种神秘艺术简直是一窍不通
谁人在敲看守门？
吃果品神秘之人
只有教友才能入内
你在外面等吧
根据我的地图所示
这罗盘上的指针好像指的不是北向
小姐，放宽心
那些沙族人人造出的东西
肯定对这个地界很熟的
那就是罗盘指向的地方
一块大岩石
这肯定是沙漠的磁力中心
岩石？太棒了，快走
也许咱们在那儿能找到水
也许在那儿能找到几个御沙者
啊！终于踏实了
我想我已经开始清醒了
看哪！
跟烂企鹅肉一个味
啊~我有点迷糊
你可真是好了伤疤忘了疼
刚从仙人掌汁那清醒过来
又去舔洞穴的墙壁
我有天生的好奇感
我看这可不是一般的洞穴
好像被什么东西雕刻过
没错，看看这形状
好像有种嗡嗡的声音在附近
有什么东西正冲咱们过来
你往哪扔呢？
那块石头差点没砸扁我
抱歉，它们在空中我辨不清方位
这只交给我了
索卡，那儿啥也没有
我想我的头脑好像还没清醒
咱们得赶快离开这儿
我这儿御术用的水已经用光了
模模
再也不能失去任何人了
快，咱们赶紧下去
拓芙，冲那儿射快石头
发射！
太好了，打中了
她打中了，对吧？
是的，现在赶紧走
在你左边
怎么样？教内会议结束了？
都搞定了
咱们这就去永固城
永固城？
咱们去土强国都城干嘛？
那城里挤满了难民，多两个人没人会注意的
咱们可以乔装成老百姓在那避避风头
那是远离烈火国的最安全的地方了
当初就连我也没能攻陷那座都城
我不太喜欢管客人的闲事
不过大街上有两个人正在找他们
见过这两个人吗？
来我们的地头要干嘛
居然还有艘御砂舟
看起来，肯定是你们从哈米部落偷的
我们发现这艘船被遗弃在沙漠中
我们正与降世神通一同行走天下
我们野牛被人偷了
我们必须赶往永固城
真是贼喊捉贼
你居然敢说我们是贼
住嘴，“甘水”，没人指责我们的族人
如果他们说的是真的，我们应该尽一下地主之谊

我错了，老爸
我认出了那个儿子的声音
他是偷阿柏的贼之一
确定吗？
我一向过耳不忘
你偷走了阿柏
它在哪儿？你们把它怎么样了？
他们在说谎，他们才是贼
我的野牛在哪？
那个谁，这俩人哪去了？
听说他们进了你的店
你也看到了
这儿除了咱们，没有旁人
以为我们不知道呢
这后面有个秘密屋
把门给我踹开
嘿，那可是养花的地儿
看来有人不走运
弄丢了一张牌手棋子
咱们回去找那个丫头吧
快说它现在在哪？
你都做了些什么？
不...不是我干的
你说要给它戴上嚼子
你居然给阿柏戴嚼子？
对不起，我不知道它是属于降世神通的啊
快说阿柏在哪！
我把它换给了个商人
可能已经被运到永固城了
他们要在那儿卖掉它
拜托！我们会护送你们出沙漠的！
我们会全力相助的！
快离开这儿！
快跑！
-=未完待续=-

水善国
土强国
火烈国
气和国
很久以前，这四大国和谐共处
然而，烈火国发起的战争结束了和平
只有同时掌握四种元素的降世神通才能结束战争
然而在大家最需要他的时候，他却消失了
年后，我和哥哥发现了转世的降世神通，
他是个御气师，名叫“安昂”
尽管他的御气术着实厉害
在拯救苍生之前，他要学的还有很多
但是我坚信
安昂 能拯救这个世界
-=降世神通=-
最后的气宗

降世神通 前情提要
咱们这就去往永固城
咱们为什么要去土强国的都城？
那城里到处都是难民
呃...苏琪最近还好吗？
她和其他的虚子武士都离镇去参战了
-快说阿柏现在在哪！
-我用它作了笔交易
它现在可能已经在永固城了
