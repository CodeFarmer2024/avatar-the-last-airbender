[Introduction Sequence]

[&#x27;Previously on Avatar&#x27; sequence includes clips from The Serpent&#x27;s Path,
The Desert, City of Walls and Secrets.]

Act I

Four weeks ago (The scene opens to a flashback of the open desert, as Wan
Shi Tong&#x27;s library sinks into the sands. In a closer shot, we see Toph
struggling to prevent the tower from submerging entirely.)

Toph: (straining) No, stop sinking!

(Cuts to Appa, surrounded by sandbenders who have him ensnared with a
number of ropes. The cowled desert nomads are desperately holding on to
the ropes in an attempt to control a snarling Appa. With a powerful toss
of his head, Appa sends one of his assailants flying over his head to
tumble into the sand. Two more of the Sandbenders narrowly avoid being
crushed by the bison&#x27;s powerful tail slap. Appa sends yet another nomad
flying overhead, and strains mightily against the ropes of the remaining
attackers. The view pans over to show Toph , hands pressed against the
tower in an attempt to halt its descent with earthbending.)

Toph: Don&#x27;t make me put this down!

(Turning from the tower, she tries to launch an earthbending attack at the
sandbenders, but it misses them harmlessly. Behind her, the building
containing her friends begins to sink rapidly, and Toph quickly turns and
braces against it, straining her powers to slow its descent. Behind her,
the sandbenders continue struggling with the sky-bison.)

Gashuin: Put a muzzle on him!

(One of the raiders loops a rope around Appa&#x27;s jaws, which he promptly
snaps. Appa lunges forward at him, and he falls backward to avoid the
bison&#x27;s massive jaws. Another rope, weighted with a pouch of sand, loops
over Appa&#x27;s right horn, and all of the raiders pull downward in an attempt
to subdue him. A powerful head butt sends one of the sandbenders hurtling
into the air, and Appa launches himself skyward. Yet another nomad snares
one of the sky-bison&#x27;s legs, and he uses sandbending to anchor himself
into the sand. Even as this bender is drug forward, a further rope is
looped around another leg, until Appa, hovering above the heads of the
anchored nomads, is finally brought crashing down to the ground. From
above we see eight of the sandbenders holding a splayed Appa against the
ground with ropes, while a sand-skiff glides close. Two of the vessels,
propelled by sandbenders, begin dragging the subdued bison away from the
library tower. We cut to a shot of Toph, still holding the tower.)

Toph: I&#x27;m sorry Appa. (she is grief-stricken, and closes her eyes
sorrowfully)

(Behind her, we see Appa growing distant, and cut to a shot of him closing
wearing a look of mournful resignation. Cut to a shot of the sun shining
above the desert sands, as the sand-skiffs slide by, hauling Appa behind
them. The young leader of the sandbender lowers his facemask, and signals
for the three skiffs to come to a halt in an open stretch of desert.)

Gashuin: (dropping to the ground) Ransack his saddle. Who knows what
treasures are stashed in there? (two nomads rush towards the bound Appa)

(Appa roars menacingly, and the two nomads stop short of him looking back
to their leader)

Gashuin: He&#x27;s tied up good, he can&#x27;t hurt you.

(The two sandbenders leap up onto Appa&#x27;s saddle, kicking up a cloud of
dust in his face that causes him to snuffle and let loose a tremendous
sneeze.
The blast of air impacts against the center skiff, sending it rocketing
through the air to wreck against a sand dune.)

Sander bender: (turning to Gashuin) What&#x27;s your father going to do when he
finds out we lost a sand sailor?
Gashuin: Nothing. (thumbs back to the wreck) It&#x27;s the one we stole from
the Hammi tribe. (turns back to Appa) Did you empty the saddle? (walks up
to the pile of gear) That&#x27;s it! Nothing but garbage! (Frustrated, he kicks
away a pair of items) Ahh! It doesn&#x27;t matter. We&#x27;ll still make a profit
from selling him to those beetle-headed merchants! (his companion picks up
a parasol and opens it up, shading himself)

(The scene fades into a shot of the remaining two skiffs dragging Appa to
a trio of large tents grouped out in the open desert. He is drug into the
camp past a group of three well dressed men. Once the skiffs stop, the men
walk around to the front of Appa stopping to his head to appraise him.)

First Beetle Merchant: How&#x27;s his temper?
Gashuin: Uhhhh, pretty good.

(Appa abruptly roars ferociously, causing the merchants to jump back in
fear, then falls silent again)

Gashuin: (sheepishly) Uh, most of the time.
Second Beetle Merchant: (turning to the first merchant) I bet someone will
pay a fortune for him in Ba Sing Se.
First Beetle Merchant: All right. You&#x27;ve got a deal.

(Gashuin, flanked by two of his fellows, accepts a small ornate chest. He
opens it and looks into it smiling before closing it and walking away. Cut
to a giant green stag beetle ridden by one of the camp followers. It
strains at a series of lines attached to its saddle, and drags a bound
Appa onto a large sled. Six wooden arms lever over from the sides of the
sled, caging the bison. A final shot shows the beetle harnessed to the
sled, as the merchants look on.
Cut to an aerial scene showing Aang riding his glider low across the waves
of sand.)

Aang: (shouting) Appa! Appa!

(A close-up of Aang&#x27;s angry face, as he begins to blow furiously on the
bison whistle. We cut to a shot of Appa&#x27;s face as his eyes snap open upon
hearing the ultrasonic note. We see the stag beetle, the array of ropes
and a pair of merchants from Appa&#x27;s point-of-view. Appa starts moaning and
struggling, rocking the entire sled back and forth. A view of the
Sandbender skiffs shows them preparing to depart.)

Gashuin: (calling back) He&#x27;s your problem now. Ha ha ha! (the two skiffs
slide away into the distance)
Second Beetle Merchant: What!?

(He and a fellow merchant turn back to the sled, which is now rocking side
to side dangerously. Appa&#x27;s tail breaks the rope holding it down, and with
a powerful tail slap he launches himself, sled and all, into the air and
over the stag beetle. He fillips over the beetle, and begins dragging it
through the camp, destroying a tent in the process.)

First Beetle Merchant: (shouting) We need the shirshu spit darts!
Second Beetle Merchant: (whips out a blowgun) Got em&#x27;! Ok big fella,
you&#x27;re gonna take a nice little snoozle. (he loads the blowgun and brings
it to his lips as he says this)

(He fires the blowgun up at Appa, piercing his foot with three small
blowgun needles. Instantly, Appa&#x27;s eyes begin to droop, and he comes to a
sliding crash back onto the desert floor.

Cut to Aang, swooping down to a landing upon a sand dune.)

Aang: (yelling) Appa! (he looks out over a seemingly endless expanse of
empty desert, lowers his face sadly) No... NOOOO!
(With this final cry of outrage, Aang leaps forward and sends an
incredible blast of air down into the desert sand. Viewed from afar, we
see a towering mushroom cloud of sand and dust explode into the sky.
Switching again to Appa&#x27;s point-of-view, we can see the cloud far, far in
the distance. The two merchants step into view as the groaning bison&#x27;s
vision begins to blur and darken.)

First Beetle Merchant: We&#x27;ve gotta get rid of this one! He&#x27;s too much
trouble.
Second Beetle Merchant: We could sell him for parts.

(Fade to black. After a moment, we begin to hear a new voice in the
darkness. Appa&#x27;s vision begins to recover, and we see through his eyes the
bars of a cage, with a man in fire nation garb regarding him from the
other side with arms crossed.)

Circus Trainer: (softly) Oh. I understand you&#x27;ve had a rather hard time
lately. That&#x27;s too bad. You probably felt you had no choice but to behave
outrageously. Like a wild animal. (walks up and strokes Appa&#x27;s forehead
through the bars) But don&#x27;t worry, you won&#x27;t anymore. (in a sinister
voice) Because I am going to break you.)

(From above, we see that Appa is enclosed in a circus wagon, and a number
of other creatures lie in cages nearby. From the outside, pennants wave in
the wind on the enormous red tent of the Fire nation circus.
Returning to the inside of the animal tent, we see the Trainer pushing a
cart of cabbages past a reclining platypus-bear. He tosses one of the
cabbages back to the bear, who catches it in his bill and munches on it.
He pushes it past Appa&#x27;s cage, and the bison rises slowly, his attention
on the cart. As he gains his feet, he finds that he has been chained and
manacled. Rumbling with displeasure, he begins gnawing at the manacle on
his forepaw. The Trainer walks past to the cage containing a
vulture-griffon, who cries out in anticipation. As he feeds the beast, he
turns to address Appa, who is watching him and drooling.

Circus Trainers: Hungry? Don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;m going to feed you too. (holds
cabbage out to Appa) But not yet. First I am going to show you how you&#x27;ll
earn it.

(He pulls the cabbage back away from Appa&#x27;s outstretched tongue, walks
back to the Vulture-Griffon and feeds it the cabbage. He opens it&#x27;s cage,
and the griffon flies out and up hovers overhead. Summoning a whip of
fire, the Trainer cracks it at the griffon then rushes forward to guide
its performance. As he steps away, Appa uses his air bending skills and
sucks in a stream of air that pulls the cart full of cabbages closer to
him. He successfully lifts one from the pile and devours it. We see the
vulture-griffon performing aerial acrobatics involving a series of hoops,
tossing one to the Trainer.)

Circus Trainer: Or course, when you perform, the hoops will be flaming.
(Appa vacuums another cabbage) And if you are careful, you won&#x27;t get
burned. (Appa releases an loud belch from behind him)
Circus Trainer: (wheeling around angrily) You&#x27;re about to be sorry.

(Summoning his fire whip, the Trainer creates a blaze in front of Appa&#x27;s
cage. Appa rears back and groans and roars in distress. The Trainer
approaches his cage, heedless of the flames between them.)

Circus Trainer: It&#x27;s obvious that whoever your previous owner was, he had
no idea how to handle you properly.
(Appa ,cowed by the flames, glares at the Trainer)

(Cut to the outside of the Main Circus Tent. Lit against the nighttime
sky, a large crowd has gathered outside the entrance. Circus style music
can be heard playing. We cut to a fire nation boy about Aang&#x27;s age, who
walks past an open tent flap. He quickly reappears, eyes wide in
amazement. He sees the caged Appa inside the tent, trying to pull a bale
of hay towards himself with his wind breath. His attempts to bring it to
him come to nothing. Turning, Appa exchanges looks with the amazed lad,
and makes a licking gesture with his tongue. The boy smiles, and seem
ready to enter, when a hulking adult shows up behind him abruptly.)

Fire Nation Man: I am gonna get a bag of sizzle-crisps. (points
commandingly) Stay here and stay away from that monster. Behave yourself,
or you&#x27;ll regret it.

(The boy watches him walk off with a meek look, then turns back to the
tent opening. Rushing inside, he starts rolling the bale toward Appa, who
gives him a friendly lick before chowing down on the hay bail. Hearing
someone approaching, the boy quickly dashes back outside.)

Circus Trainer: (approaching from the other direction) He&#x27;s a difficult
creature, stubborn and willful. I need more time with him. It&#x27;s too risky
right now. (he and the ringmaster step fully into view)
Ring Master: (Angrily) Too Risky? What are you talking about? (gestures
dramatically) This is the circus, home of fear and danger. I want the Wind
Buffalo to perform tonight. (he stalks off-scene)
Circus Trainer: (turns to glare at Appa) If you don&#x27;t behave yourself,
you&#x27;ll regret it.

(Stepping forward, he creates a large torch of flame before Appa&#x27;s face,
who shrinks back in his cage and growls in fear and anger. He stomps off,
and we see that the small boy has watched the entire scene from the edge
of the tent flap. He looks sad, then exchanges another friendly look with
Appa. The large man comes up behind him and starts guiding him away.)

Fire Nation Man: Let&#x27;s go!
Fire Nation Boy: (waving) See ya later buddy.

(As the boy&#x27;s waving hand disappears, Appa turns and settles down in his
cage with a deep sorrowful sigh. A quick cut to the outside of the Main
Tent, then inside where we find the circus underway. Two women are
spinning plates on top of long sticks, two platypus-bears in costume
balance on large balls, and a group of men stand three high in a pyramid.
We see the cheering crowd, seated on bleachers. The young boy from earlier
reaches for a sizzle-crisp, but the man snatches them away selfishly.)

Ring Master: (voice-over) Ladies and gentleman, now for something truly
special. (we cut to him as he creates a pair of flames from his palms) A
noble beast so magnificent and rare, it hasn&#x27;t been seen by human eyes in
generations. (gesturing, he creates a fiery flash to his left) I give you
the Wind Buffalo!

(We pan to a curtain, which drops to reveal a rather dejected looking
Appa, looking ridiculous in an outlandish circus get-up, his face painted
in clown fashion. Appa paws unhappily at his fake beard. The crowd begins
laughing as the young boy looks on unhappily. Appa enters the center ring,
where he is joined by the Circus Trainer.)

Circus Trainer: Up. (Appa shakes his head and turns completely around, to
the crowds amusement)
Circus Trainer: (looks back from crowd angrily) Up, you insolent cow!

(He creates a fire whip and cracks it at Appa, who roars at him in
defiance. In the audience, the boy jumps up from his seat.)

Fire Nation Boy: (shouting and gesturing) Run away! Get away from him.
(the large man pulls him back into his seat)

(The Circus trainer, whip ablaze, coaxes Appa into rising upward to the
amazement of the crowd. The spectators clap and cheer as the small boy
looks heartbroken. We see Appa begin a series of aerial acrobatics through
flaming hoops. His costume catches fire as he passes through the second
hoop, and he tail-slaps the third one, sending it hurtling to smash into
the Circus trainer.)

Circus Trainer: Augh! Oof. (he crashes senseless to the ground)

(In another Appa point-of-view shot, we see the assembled crowd laughing
in the bleachers. Appa focuses in on the young boy, and we flash back to a
similar sepia-toned scene of Aang laughing in a similar pose. Appa,
growling in frustration, begins shaking off his beard as the crowd
continues to laugh merrily.)

Fire Nation Boy: Go. You can do it.

(Appa starts to rise into the air, only to be intercepted by a blast of
fire from below that sends him in the other direction.)

Circus Trainer: (furious) Get back here, you stupid beast!

(The Trainer, now recovered, again creates his fire whip as Appa swoops
down at him. He cracks it just as Appa strikes him with an upward tail
lash, sending him hurtling up and out though the roof of the tent, sailing
in a high arc. Appa crashes through an opening in the tent&#x27;s roof,
shedding the rest of his costume as he does so. The smiling young boy
looks upward at the dangling remains of the freed bison&#x27;s costume. Appa
soars away into the night, the lights of the circus fading away below
him.)

Act II

(The scene opens to Appa soaring above the desert in the early dawn, as he
comes upon the crater left by the disappearing Library. We flash back to
his remembrance of the tower, and he lands in the crater and starts pawing
at the sand. With a great bellow of despair he collapses onto his belly in
the center of the crater. Cuts again to the shackled bison flying above
the desert floor, his stomachs rumbling with hunger. Spying a large egg
lying on the desert floor, Appa lands heavily next to it. But just before
he can lap up the egg with his tongue a small bipedal lizard rushes up,
snatches it and flees into the rocks with the egg held high. Appa spots a
Jackelope standing next to a small cactus in the distance, and swoops
over, frightening off the small creature. He bites off the entire cactus,
then spits it out, roaring in pain and wagging his hurt tongue. We cut
again to a tired looking Appa flying low over the midday desert, and he
suddenly begins sniffing the air with interest.

He flies toward a large stone mesa, and descends into one of the many
openings in the gigantic mud hive built atop it. Moments later, Appa zooms
back out, hotly pursued by an angry swarm of buzzard-wasps. Wheeling about
in the air, he sends them crashing to the desert floor with a great
wind-gust sweep of his tail. Stunned, the buzzard-wasps rise and fly
slowly back to their hive. Gasping and panting, Appa lands dripping of
honey. Rolling onto his side, he hungrily laps the honey from his fur,
collapsing with a satisfied, exhausted sigh. Cut to sunset, as Appa flies
over greener, less desolate lands. Looking tired and bedraggled, he flies
in to land on a farm, entering a large domed barn. He devours a pile of
hay, then flops down and immediately lapses into a deep slumber.

A Sepia-tone dream sequence shows us the Eastern Air Temple, built high
upon three mist shrouded peaks. We see an adorable Air bison calf swoop
into view, joined by four others and an adult bison. The cooing calves fly
in a circle around the adult, then pause to nuzzle it before flying
downward, the adult in tow. Below, a group of small boys in airbender
garb, take apples from a large bowl held by an airbender nun. We see that
one of them is a young Aang, at age 6 or so.)

Air Nomad Woman: Chose well. A sky bison is a companion for life.

(The bison land on the terrace in front of the boys, and Aang approaches
what is certainly a young Appa. Aang holds out the apple, which the calf
sniffs before opening his mouth and letting Aang toss it in. Young Aang
spreads his arms affectionately over the calf&#x27;s head, who responds by
knocking him to the ground and licking his face affectionately.)

Aang: (lying on his back) Ugh! I guess this mean we&#x27;ll always be together.
(he laughs as the calf begins licking him again)

(The scene changes to the night camp upon the Serpent&#x27;s Pass, where a
dreaming Aang mimics the scene we just observed laughing as the dream calf
licks him. Aang rolls to his side upon his bedroll with a blissful look on
his face.)

Aang: (smiling in his sleep) Always.

(Cut back to Appa, slumbering inside the barn. He is roused by a human cry
of terror.)

Farmer: AAhhh! It&#x27;s some kind of monster!

(From Appa&#x27;s p.o.v. we see a wide-eyed Earth peasant waving a pitchfork in
his face. Appa rises angrily to his feet, his manacles rattling, and
growls a warning to the farmer. The farmer&#x27;s wife comes to the barn
entrance, carrying a bright torch. Seeing the blazing torch, Appa rears
onto his hind legs in panic, sending the couple running and screaming. In
a full panic Appa crashes up through the roof of the barn, sending up a
rush of wind that extinguishes the torch carried by the couple, who lie
sprawled in the dirt.

Cut to a scene of Appa flying over the Serpent&#x27;s Pass, passing in the
pre-dawn air over an Earth Kingdom vessel. From the deck, a shocked Iroh
watches the forlorn bison pass overhead and away.)

Iroh: Huh!
Zuko: (roused from sleep) Uncle? What are you looking at? Is there
something out there?
Iroh: (nervously) Uh, it&#x27;s nothing. Go back to sleep. (he sighs in relief
as Zuko falls asleep again)

(Appa descends towards forested bluffs, and crashes groggily near a
tree-capped mine entrance. He begins to nibble some grass, before being
roused by a loud squealing echoing from the mine entrance. He turns just
as an enraged porcupine-boar charges out of the mine, crashing into him
and sending them both rolling down the hillside. Both of them crash to a
halt below, and we see that Appa already has a number of large quills
sticking out from his side. Appa and his opponent both roar a challenge,
and they begin to circle one another. Suddenly the porcupine-boar charges
Appa&#x27;s flank, plowing the bison into a tree that snaps in two from the
impact. Seizing the tree in his mouth, Appa tosses it at the boar driving
him backwards into a line of trees. Squealing in rage, the porcupine boar
leaps over the tree, charging headlong towards the sky-bison.

Rearing onto his hind legs, Appa catches the charging boar and hurls him
deep into the forest, where the beast finally loses heart and flees into
the night. Panting heavily from exertion, Appa plucks one of the quills
from his hide with his teeth, the ground trembling from his roar of agony.
He half flies half stumbles up the hill to the mine entrance, and
collapses inside, utterly spent.

Cut to the following morning, where Appa lies unconscious inside the mine.
The day passes again into night, as it begins to rains steadily outside.

Another morning, and we see the Kyoshi warriors gathering red berries from
a group of bushes. One of the warriors notices clumps of white fur hanging
from the branches of a bush.)

Kyoshi Warrior: (plucking a mass of fur) Must have been some fight.
Suki: Wait. Let me see that. (takes the clump of fur) No. It couldn&#x27;t be.

(We follow her gaze up the side of the hill, a devastated scene of broken
trees and stripped earth. She follows the path of destruction, climbing up
the bluff and finally pulling herself up to the top. She discovers the
ragged bison lying in the shadow of the mine entrance.)

Suki: Huh? Appa? Oh no.

(Roused by her voice, Appa cowers back into the mine growling. As Suki
approaches, she sees his chains as well as the various injuries he has
sustained. Kneeling near the entrance she lays down a double handful of
berries and fruit.)

Suki: (reassuringly) It&#x27;s gonna be ok Appa. I have to leave, but I am
gonna be back soon with help.

(She turns and hurries back down the bluff. Appa emerges and cautiously
sniffs at the fruit. Later we see Suki leading the other Kyoshi warriors
carefully up the side of the bluff, as Appa lies back inside the mine
entrance.)

Suki: (addressing the others) No sudden movements. He&#x27;s been lost for
awhile, and he looks like he&#x27;s hurt. He&#x27;s shy around people and scared.
Stay low, and stay quiet.
Kyoshi Warrior: I can&#x27;t believe you found the Avatar&#x27;s bison. Didn&#x27;t you
just see the Avatar a few days ago&#x27;
Suki: Yes, so he can&#x27;t be too far from here. It&#x27;s our responsibility to
get Appa back to him safely. This could be our most important mission yet.

(Turning, she leads the other girls up the rest of the way, pausing at the
top of the hill. Appa notices them, and rises to his feet roaring an angry
warning.)

Suki: Give him some space! (they back up a pace, as Suki edges closer)
Appa, it&#x27;s me, Suki. I&#x27;m a friend. (walks toward Appa, who moans warily) I
want to help you. You&#x27;re hurt. We can help you feel better. And we can
help you find Aang. (she cautiously places her hand on his nose, and he
lays down and closes his eyes in acceptance)

(Cut to a scene showing the manacles and quills lying in the grass, while
further off, a better-better looking Appa sits among the girl warriors
licking the face of one with his great tongue. Suddenly his ears twitch to
approaching danger, and as he turns about, a bolt of blue lightning fells
a nearby tree. Azula, Mai and Ty Lee ride out of the hills on the backs of
mongoose dragons, reigning to a halt before the Kyoshi warriors.)

Azula: (holding out a clump of white fur) My, my, you&#x27;re easy to find.
(tosses it aside) It&#x27;s really astounding my brother hasn&#x27;t captured you
yet.

(The Kyoshi warriors stand ready around Appa, as the three regard them
from the saddles of their mounts. Scene goes to black.)

Act III

(We return to the preceding scene, as Appa rears and growls threateningly.
The warriors drop as one into combat stances, unfurling war fans and
collapsible shields.)

Suki: What do you want with us?
Azula: (mockingly) Who are you, the Avatar&#x27;s fan girls?
Ty Lee: (thinks for a moment, then brightens) Oh, I get it! I get it. Good
one azula!
Suki: If you are looking for the Avatar, you&#x27;re out of luck.
Mai: (sighs despondently) I knew this was a waste of time.
Azula: No avatar huh? (shrugs) Well that&#x27;s ok, any friend of the Avatar,
is an enemy of mine.

(As she finishes saying this, Azula does a spinning aleap from her saddle,
sending a blast of blue fire towards the warriors. They leap to form a
shield wall in front of Appa, deflecting the fire blast. Mai and Ty Lee
flip forward out of their saddles to engage the warriors in combat. Mai,
landing on her feet, produces a brace of throwing knives from her sleeve.
With a sweeping throw, she pins a startled warrior to a tree by her
clothing.)

Mai: You&#x27;re so colorful, it&#x27;s making me nauseous.

(Mai spins and throws a barrage of throwing-arrows at a second warrior,
who draws a katana and cuts them from the air. She takes a couple of
swings at Ty Lee, who nimbly evades her slashes before felling her with a
flurry of pressure-point strikes.)

Ty Lee: (hands on hips) You&#x27;re not prettier than we are!

(Suki continues to stand between Azula and Appa, blocking her fire blasts
with her shield. Azula&#x27;s second more powerful blast ricochets off Suki&#x27;s
shield, setting fire to the tree she had felled initially. As it catches
on fire, Appa cowers back from the leaping flames.)

Azula: Afraid of fire I see. That&#x27;s good, you should be!
Suki: (drawing her sword) Go Appa! Fly away from here! Get out of here.

(As Appa rises to the sky, Suki charges Azula. The Fire princess performs
an amazing horizontal mid-air spin, simultaneously avoiding her thrust and
sending her sword flying from her hands to imbed in a tree. Suki blocks
another fire blast, then Azula counters her kick and trips Suki to the
ground. Pausing at the sight of Suki in danger, Appa turns and flies back
to help. Ready to finish Suki, Azula dodges beneath a pair of hurled
war-fans hurled at her back, and turns to launch a retaliatory attack.
Suki rises to her feet, rushing to wave off the approaching sky-bison)

Suki: (waving a burning branch) Get out of here! You have to find Aang!
We&#x27;ll be ok!

(Clearly torn, Appa finally shies away and flies off into the sky. Smiling
in relief, Suki barely reacts in time to block a blast of blue fire with
her shield. Staggered backwards, she falls into a battle-stance, unfolding
her war fan.)

Azula: (contemptuously) Don&#x27;t you know that fans just make flames
stronger?

(The two charge one another, and as they clash the scene action freezes
and the scene closes. Cut to Appa above the forest, then flying along a
river among a flock of white birds. We see Appa flying through dark skies
in a torrential downpour, passing above a pair of Southern Water tribe
ships sailing through the rains. On the deck of one of the vessels, we see
Hakoda staring up at the sky-bison in wonder. Cut again to Appa flying
steadily over misty peaks, until in the distance we recognize the ruins of
the Eastern Air Temple. Appa enters the broken, weedy ruins of the
Sky-Bison stables, and in flashback we see it restored, with young bison
calves frolicking through its warm hay covered halls.

Resuming his journey through the stables, Appa comes across a round metal
framework, and once more in flashback we see bison calves teething at it
the bars. Back in the present, Appa chomps on the ring, but the dust
causes him to cough and he leaves it unsatisfied. Crossing one of the
spans between the peaks Appa passes through and steps out onto a terrace.
Framed against the rising sun is a bald figure sitting cross-legged at the
end of the terrace. Mistaking him for Aang, he bounds forward and knocks
the figure on his back, licking his face with gusto. We see that it is not
Aang, however, but a bald, brown skinned old man with a long snowy beard
and bushy eyebrows. The old man blinks in surprise at the sky-bison
standing over him, before recovering to speak in a thick East Indian
accent.)

Guru: Hello. I am Guru Pathik. (realizing it&#x27;s not Aang, Appa jumps away
and turns to stare him down)
Guru: (leaning up) I know I am not the person you expected. And I didn&#x27;t
expect to be licked by a giant tongue just now. The world is full of
surprises.

(Appa gives him a long menacing growl, and the old man calmly lies back
down on his back closing his eyes. Later in the day, the guru raises his
head to look at the waiting bison, who growls at him, causing him to lower
his head and close his eyes again. Still later peeks open an eye to peer
at Appa, who again issues a low growl. Once again the guru calmly closes
his eyes. Night falls, and we see Appa lying on his side, snoring loudly.
Opening his eyes, the lean old man nimbly rolls backwards to his feet,
stands and dusts his hands in satisfaction. Rubbing his hands together he
walks up to the chest of the slumbering Appa. He touches Appa&#x27;s neck with
two fingers, then places his hand on the bison&#x27;s leathery chest plate.)

Guru: Oh, dear. You&#x27;ve been through so much recently. Hurt and betrayed,
so twisted up inside. (he runs two fingers along Appa&#x27;s underside, then
places a hand on his belly) You&#x27;re still full of love. (sighs) But fear
has moved in where trust should be. (we pan upward to show the temple, as
continues in voice-over) I&#x27;ve been expecting you and the young Avatar for
quite a long time. I had a vision many years ago of helping him. That&#x27;s
why I came to the Eastern Air Temple. (standing near the restless Appa&#x27;s
head) Ahh. Your emotions are so turbulent. Like swirling storm clouds.
(places a hand on Appa&#x27;s brow) Let the clouds in your mind be gentle,
peaceful ones. (as he says this Appa calms into a deep pleasant sleep)

(Appa&#x27;s eyes snap open, revealing another night has passed, and he rises
looking around surprised. He notices a small pile of fruit before him, and
eagerly snaps it up. Turning he notices another piece of fruit, and still
another, until he is eating his way back into the temple behind him. We
cut to a peak reached by a stair curving around its side. The Eastern
Temple is framed just behind it. On its top is centered a stone dais,
surrounded by a rock garden and a copse of trees. Appa follows the stairs
up to the base of the platform. We see Guru, sitting in a meditative pose
with a bird perched on his head, surrounded by birds and small woodland
creatures. he holds out a handful of seeds, and another bird lands on it.)

Guru: Someone looks very well-rested, judging by your bed head.(Appa lows
at him in greeting, and shakes his fur back into place)

(Cut to a full moon-lit sky, and pans to the stone dais, where Guru sits
in deep meditation, while Appa paces behind him, before finally lying next
to him. then opens his eyes and turns to pat Appa&#x27;s belly, gathering up a
rolled and tied parchment and rising to his feet.)

Guru: I have prepared a message for Aang. May I attach it to your horn?
(Appa seems to assent, and secures the message to a horn, then, standing
before Appa) You and the Avatar&#x27;s energies are mixed. You have an
unbreakable bond. By reading your energy, (touches Appa&#x27;s forehead) I can
sense where Aang is. (Appa licks his face with his great tongue) Funny,
what invisible strings connect us all.

(Placing his hand on Appa&#x27;s brow, he closes his eyes and both seem to
focus. intently. From a distance we see a pale light emit from them both,
and a path of light snakes away down the side of the peak).

Guru: (speaking in voice-over, as the light focuses on Appa&#x27;s head) I will
see you again, great beast.

Cut to Appa soaring down toward the city of Ba Sing Se. Silhouetted by the
full moon, he passes over the inner wall, over the rooftops below. He is
watched from the peak of a roof by a pair of Dai Li agents, who slide down
after he passes. Appa hovers over the city, looking about for signs of
Aang. Suddenly his eyes snap wide in excitement as he hears the familiar
sound of the bison whistle. He descends rapidly, landing in an open square
in the city&#x27;s lower circle and bounding down a street.

Cut to show the bison whistle, lying unused next to a sleeping Aang and
Momo. Somewhere in the city, a figure stands in the shadows blowing
another whistle. As Appa turns a corner he man steps out into the light,
revealing himself as Long Feng. He walks forward, lowering the whistle.
Appa retreats back, leaving the footprint in the mud that is seen in the
previous episode. With an earthbending gesture, Long Feng causes the
entire street section to revolve like a trap door, dropping Appa into a
passage beneath the city.

As the dust settles and the camera fades back, we are left with a final
view of the footprint, the last trace of Appa to be seen.)

咱们现在多顺啊
这才是多大点的胜利啊
咱们之前可是接连倒霉了几个星期
我们只能寄希望于他
如果我们想要在日食那天侵入烈火国的话
我们需要土强王的兵力支持
你怎么知道他会答应呢？
你们可能也都发现了
咱们几个好像都挺衰的
即便如此，我仍然觉得前途大好
这次会一帆风顺的
索卡，长风仍然控制着都城
有戴笠的支持，他的阴谋势力仍然很强大
我想还是赶紧飞离这个鬼地方吧
我赞成“好好小姐”的建议
我再也不想见到永固城了，即便我本来就看不见
可是我们现在已经把阿柏找回来了
没有什么能阻止我们将真相告诉土强王
他有权知道那些阴谋和战争
看看，安昂也赞同我
别忘了这是咱们来这儿的首要任务
我们得试一下
那个，我想如果土强王知道
真相的话，局势将会有所转变
我可不相信这个乐观的新索卡
长风也把你给洗脑了，对吧？
那可能是戴笠
他们肯定正在搜寻我们，怎么办？
咱们飞吧
咱们能买个新鞍子吗？
就这么飞简直太吓人了
就在那儿，那一片就是皇宫了
土强王的宫殿应该就在正中心
咱们得小心点
长风可能已经警告土强王咱们要来
你瞎寻思嘛呀？
要我说，咱们肯定能直飞...啊
那是什么？
地对空岩石弹，越来越多了
抱歉
对不起，我们只是想过去觐见土强王
说真的，咱们其实是同一战线的
抱歉了
里面就是了
拓芙，找土强王该走哪条路？
你问我我问谁去？
我离开永固城时还不记事呢
-有刺客！
-抱歉，走错门了
（Burglar: 窃贼）
这件事你做的对，放走神通的野牛是明智之举
我有点难受
这门看起来就很气派
就是它没错了
你不能先打个招呼啊
我们需要跟您谈谈
他们来这儿是想谋朝篡位
才不是，咱们是同一战线的
我们来这儿是想帮助您
您得相信我们
你们硬闯入我的皇宫
撂倒我的侍卫，弄坏我华丽的殿门
还指望着我相信你们？
他说得很在理
如果想证明你们的诚意
就放下武器，然后退下
看吧，我们是朋友，尊敬的陛下
把这些刺客给我拿下
我们都已经放下武器了
我们可是您的同盟啊
确保神通和他的朋友们都见不到明天的太阳
降世神通？
你就是神通？
我不是，是他
在这儿呢
是神通又怎么样？他们可是国家公敌
也许你是对的
既然波斯科喜欢他
就给他一个说话的机会吧
陛下，城外有一场战争正在进行
事实上，这战争已经持续百年之久了
戴笠向您隐瞒了这一切
并阴谋掌控整座城市以及您的一举一动
有我不知道的战争？真是无稽之谈
全是胡扯
长风不想让我们告诉您真相
所以他偷走了我们的飞天野牛，以便勒索我们
他不光勒索我们，还把我们的朋友给洗脑了
一派胡言，陛下
我从来都没见过什么飞天野牛
老实说，我以为它们都已经灭绝了
即便你是降世神通
你的申辩也很难让人信服
这些小流氓是无政府组织的一支
我手下的特工已经跟踪他们数周了
如果你听信了他们的谗言
那无疑是自寻死路
我不得不相信我的顾问
且慢，我能证明他在说谎
长风说他从未见过飞天野牛
那好，让他卷起他的左裤腿
啥？在大殿上赤身裸体成何体统？
就在那儿！是被阿柏咬的
从没见过飞天野牛，是吗？
那是一块大胎记罢了
谢你啊，现在大家都知道了
我想没有方法能证明那印迹从何而来
当然有办法
没错，的确相当吻合
好耶
不过那并不能证明你们所说的阴谋理论
尽管如此，我想这仍然值得进一步调查
-好吧   -说得在理
-是啊   -那好吧
你的额头都烫手了
你这回烧的真够厉害的
用这帮你降降温吧
好渴啊
这有干净的水，喝点吧
盖好被子，冒冒汗就好了
哦，原来火车就长这样啊
我没想到会这样...公开化
这么说您从来都没出过内环喽
我从未出过皇宫
那么飞着旅行才叫爽哩
那个，能问一下我们要去哪吗？
陛下，我们将去劳改湖
那湖下有戴笠的秘密总部
在那您就能亲眼目睹洗脑和
其他阴谋是如何进行的
被毁了
哦，不是吧
没关系，我仍然很乐观
戴笠肯定知道我们会来
所以销毁了证据
嗯，这实在没法叫人信服
嘿，这恰恰证明他们
还有很多不可告人的阴谋
长风说得没错，这简直就是在浪费时间
请原谅，我要打道回宫了
对了，城墙！他们肯定来不及修复的
如果您跟我们去外城
我们能向您证明那场秘密的战争是真实的
历代土强王都未去过外城
我可没闲工夫听你们瞎扯
如果您跟我们去
我可以让您骑阿柏
第一次飞吧？
我是又兴奋又害怕
是啊，我也恨透飞行了
跟你们说实在的
我真的很希望你们
跟我说的那场战争并不存在
我又何尝不是呢
为时不早了
吾皇是否准备好要退位了呢？
我还不累
放松，烈火王祖寇
放手吧，屈从吧
就让你的眼睛闭上一会儿吧
不，烈火王祖寇！
别听蓝龙的谗言
你应该赶快离开这儿
快走，要不然就太晚了
快睡吧，烈火王祖寇
睡吧，就像母后那样
祖寇，救我啊！
它还在那儿
那是什么？
那是个钻头，是烈火国制作的巨钻
专门用来钻透您的城墙的
真不敢相信我居然都不知道
请容我解释，陛下
不必大惊小怪的，不过是个建筑工程罢了
是嘛，那么请问为什么你们
的建筑工程上会有烈火国的徽章呢？
那个，这项目是进口的
你也知道国内的机械水平不怎么样的
您不会相信这些毛孩子吧
我可是您最器重的御用随从啊
戴笠，逮捕长风
将他以叛国罪收押，等待受审
你们不能抓我
没有我你们可怎么活啊
看来长风以后只能在监狱里喝西北风了
哈...哦，耶，
这笑话我已经想了很久了
我要谢谢你们大家
你们这群英雄少年打开了我的眼界
我一直引以为傲的大都会
只不过是一座庸人之城罢了
而我更是庸人之首
我们正处于烈火国挑起的战事之中
陛下，这正是我们造访永固城的原因
我们认为您能帮助我们结束这场战争
我们的时间不多了
夏天将有颗彗星来临
它的能量将给予火宗不可估量的力量
那时他们将不可战胜
不过仍有希望，在彗星到来之前
我们有个机会可以取得胜利
将会有日食发生
那天太阳将被月亮完全遮住
火宗人将无抵抗之力
索卡，你有什么建议
我们应该在那天侵入烈火国
让我们来一场黑日反击
不好吧，那将需要撤出永固城所有的部队
永固城也将毫无抵抗之力
永固城已经是火宗的攻击对象了
永固城一日不灭，烈火国是不会善罢甘休的
你可以坐以待毙，也可以奋起反击
不如给自己一个抗击的机会吧
好吧，我会全力支持你们的
-太好了
-好耶   -合作愉快！
陛下
抱歉打搅您
这位是郝将军，他是五人协会的统领
我手下的头号大将军
我们奉命搜查了长风的府邸
找到了一些大家都很感兴趣的东西
这是永固城中所有人的秘密文件
当然也有这些孩子的
秘密文件？
北方拓芙
是你母亲的来信
你妈妈就在城中，她想要见你
长风截下了我们的家信？
真是不知廉耻
安昂，在你的野牛被抓住时
这封信绑在它犄角上
这封信来自东气和寺
请问有给我和索卡的信吗？
好像没有
不过这有一条情报，你们可能会感兴趣
一支水族的小舰队？
啥？那有可能是老爸他们
这支舰队由哈库达领导
戍守变色龙湾的入口，那不就是老爸吗

你得的可不是什么常见的疾病
不过喝点茶应该不会碍事的
怎么了，发生什么事了？
在湖下的时候
你作出了艰难的抉择
你与自己的另一面展开了殊死搏斗
这场搏斗仍在你的意志和身体中继续
那是什么意思？
我的皇侄，现在的你就像在蜕变一样
也许蜕变的过程并不好过
不过一旦破茧成蝶
你将会成为一名真正英俊的王子
真不敢相信，居然有个人
生活在东气和寺，他说他是位古鲁
啥是古鲁？是一种有毒的河豚鱼？
不是，古鲁是通晓灵学的专家
他想帮助我继续下阶段神通的修行
他说他能教我如何掌握神通形态
我们居然知道老爸的下落了
我了解你的感受
我母亲就在城中
看信中所写，她最终还是理解了我
这些都是大好的消息
咱们应该从哪件事开始呢？
我不想这么说，不过我们得分头行动了
分开？我们刚刚找到阿柏
大家也才重聚
为什么现在就要分开？
你得去见那个古鲁，安昂
如果我们要进攻烈火国，你应该做好准备
好吧，如果我去东气和寺的话
可以捎你们去变色龙湾见父亲
需要留下个人跟土强王一起制定进攻计划
还是我留下吧
不，索卡，我知道你很想去帮老爸
你就去变色龙湾吧，我留在这陪土强王
你...
真是...世界上...最好的...妹妹
别这样，哥哥
不过你说的对，我的确是最好的
卡塔拉，我有几句话要跟你说
其实好久之前就想跟你说了
什么话，安昂？
卡塔拉，我...
好喽！准备好开始我们的兄弟之旅了吗？
安昂，索卡，祝你们一路顺风
永固城的人民感谢你们
我们期待着你们的归来
陛下 ，有三位女武士想要求见
她们自称是来自于虚子岛的武士
是苏琪
你认识她们？
哦，当然，虚子武士是一群武艺精湛
且值得信赖的战士，她们是我们的好朋友
我一定会将她们待为上宾的
等等，安昂
-我会很想念你们的
-我也是
好了，够了，好吧
我们是相亲相爱的一家人，真的
看吧，安昂，乐观的想法可以创造奇迹
我们得到了土强王的支持，逮捕了长风
等我们回来，苏琪会在那里等我
是啊，姑娘们在等咱们呢
谢了，“乐观态度”
从此以后将会事事顺利的，直到永远
您的晚饭
五人协会和军队听命于土强王
不过戴笠将永远听您差遣，长风大人
嘿，妈妈，有人在吗？
嘿！你们知道老子是谁吗？
离家出走的大嗓门小屁孩儿呗
在我们最需要帮助的时候
我们热切的欢迎尊敬的同盟到访
欢迎你们虚子武士
我们是您谦卑的仆人
-=未完待续=-

水善国
土强国
火烈国
气和国
很久以前，这四大国和谐共处
然而，烈火国发起的战争结束了和平
只有同时掌握四种元素的降世神通才能结束战争
然而在大家最需要他的时候，他却消失了
年后，我和哥哥发现了转世的降世神通，
他是个御气师，名叫“安昂”
尽管他的御气术着实厉害
在拯救苍生之前，他要学的还有很多
但是我坚信
安昂 能拯救这个世界
-=降世神通=-
最后的气宗

降世神通 前情提要
居然有个人生活在东气和寺
他说他能教我掌握神通形态
我怎么了？
我的皇侄，现在的你正在经历一次蜕变
戴笠将永远听候您的差遣，长风大人
有人在吗？
虚子武士，欢迎你们的到来
我们是您谦卑的仆人

第二卷
土
第十九章
古鲁
那是什么味啊？
糨糊粥
你肯定不会喜欢的
咋会呢，闻起来就很好吃
皇叔，给我盛一碗吧
你应该退烧了吧，怎么感觉你有点不一样
这是新的一天
我们有了新公寓
置办了新家具，而且
今天还是您的茶馆开张大吉的好日子
皇叔，是好兆头啊
已经两年没见到你父亲了吧
你肯定贼激动，是不？
我应该激动的，对吧
不过我怎么感到胃有点不舒服
别太紧张了，能见到你他肯定也高兴极了
你怎么样？
要去见古鲁，是不是也很紧张？
一点也不，不掌握好神通形态
我誓不罢休
一周后见，驾，驾
索卡，你咋来了
索卡！
好啊，老爸！
我说波斯科，虚子武士是来保护咱们的
你是不是很激动啊？
我这周真是祸事不断啊
我最信任的顾问，长风
和他统领的戴笠居然企图谋朝篡位
最亲近的人却不能信任
这真是太可怕了
不过也有好消息
就在现在
五人议会正在制定
今夏入侵烈火国的作战计划
就在日食那天
真的吗？
真是绝顶妙计啊
冯将军的基地将作为进攻的发射点
两个月后的今天，陆军和海军将同时侵入烈火国
代号为“黑日行动”
不如我们派模模
去搞些破坏行动吧，你看它...
抱歉
万事俱备，只需土强王合金印批准了
我立刻就向吾皇上呈计划
谢谢你，郝将军
你好
你就是古鲁帕提克吧
阿柏角上绑着的信是你发的吧
没错，我与气宗有着千丝万缕的联系
雅俗大师和我更是私交很深
你在信中说可以传授我
掌握神通形态的方法
要怎么做？
在重复天下平衡之前
你先要平和自己的内心
第一步就从这开始吧
干了它
喝起来像是洋葱香蕉汁
没错
我觉得咱们应该向右拐
别胡扯了
北方家的府邸应该在这个方向
肯定是你搞错了
你们两个老太太就不能消停一会吗？
我想上厕所
好吧，不过得快点
你脑袋进水了？
哦，拓芙你可真是狡猾狡猾地哟
不过想骗大爷我，你还嫩点
可别让我出去
否则打得你俩屁股开花
别白费力气了
即便你是世上最厉害的御土师
你拿金属也没辙
姑娘们，现在是我们的绝佳时机
对，赶快卸妆
省得梅总是愁眉苦脸的
我说的是拿下整个土强国
咱们烈火国已经在永固城外觊觎了几百年了
如今我们已在永固城之内
我们可以亲手将其颠覆
唉，你还真镇定，我对你的钦佩
真如滔滔江水连绵不绝啊
在城内我们可以出其不意
一举推倒土强王的政权
关键就在于戴笠
得戴笠者，得永固城
你只有打通所有脉轮，才能够掌握神通形态
（Chakra，脉轮，火影中所说的查克拉）
安昂，谈谈你对脉轮的了解
脉轮是嘛啊？
哦，我晓得了，看来咱们要从基础开始
你身体中能量的流动
正如这小溪中的水流一样
你会发现在溪水向前流淌之前
水会在这种小池中回旋
我们的轮脉就像这些小池一样
这么说，脉轮就是我们体中能量回旋之地
答对
倘若溪中无杂物，溪水将一路纯净前行
然而，生活就是一团麻
溪水中不免会有些异物
你说那会怎样呢？
溪水不能流动了？
对头
不过只要我们打通了池与池间的通路
能量就会随意流动
人体中共有七个脉轮
每一个能量池都有自己的用途
会被不同的情绪污物堵塞
要记住
打开脉轮会对你有强烈的影响
一旦开始，七个脉轮
全部打开后才能停止
准备好了吗？
我会竭尽全力的
首先我们要打开的是“土脉轮”
它位于你的脊椎骨底
由生存意识掌控
被你的恐惧所阻塞
你最害怕的是什么？
让你的恐惧呈现在你的眼前
安昂
那些只是幻境而已
我知道你为生存而忧
但是你必须放弃这些恐惧
让你的恐惧随溪水流走吧
你已经打开了“土脉轮”
下一个是...
“水脉轮”？
聪明！没准有朝一日
你也能成为一名古鲁
“水脉轮”由快乐掌控
但是易被愧疚感阻塞
现在，面对你所有的愧疚
你为什么要责怪自己？
我跑掉了
是我伤害了那些人民
接受这些已经发生的现实吧
别让他们遮蔽并荼毒你的能量
如果你想正面的引导这个世界
你要学会宽恕自己
这座海湾直通永固城的郊外
我们用这些“纠结水雷”来阻止火宗的舰船通过
这些“纠结水雷”是你父亲自己发明的
威力很大，浮力强，而且...
...臭死人不偿命
观察的很敏锐嘛
这水雷里面填满了臭鼬鼠鱼和海藻
一旦船只撞上破他们
海藻就会缠上螺旋桨
而散发出的恶臭会令他们弃船
我叫它“臭沉弹”
（Stink &amp; sink ：臭且沉，还押韵呢~）
真有你的，老爸
真是有其父必有其子
哈库达，我们侦察兵发现了四艘火宗舰船
巴图，把这些水雷装上船
其他人，准备作战
老爸，我该干点嘛？
没听见吗？我说其他人准备作战
我们刚来时还是流浪汉呢
谁料到我居拥然有了自己的茶馆
黄天不负有心人啊，祖寇
祝贺你，叔叔
我真的很感激啊
这是你应得的，“茉莉龙”将是全城最好的茶馆
不是，我感激地是
你能陪我一同度过这特别的一天
这对我意义非凡
咱们开始给客人们做茶吧
好喽！开工开工！
第三个脉轮就是“火脉轮”
它就位于你的胃中
我的“火脉轮”想吃点别的东西
最好不是洋葱香蕉汁
这时还搞笑，继续
“火脉轮”关乎你的力量
会被你的羞愧阻塞
你对何事感到羞愧？
你对自己做的哪件事最失望？
我再也不用御火术了
不能再用了
如果你不能完全认同自己
你将永远也找不到平衡
你是降世神通
因此你必是一名御火师
这个脉轮打开时并不像小溪淌水
更像是野牛打嗝
有洋葱和香蕉的味道，好像还有其他的...
泡菜？
这身行头我真是穿够了
怎么可能有人穿它来打仗
也难怪我们能这么轻易的打败她们
还抢来了这身衣服
我们还要服侍那个土强王多久？
如果再让我清理那些熊粪
我就要吐了
阿祖拉公主向我们保证
只要抓住神通我们就可以回国了
稍安勿躁
小声点！
害怕别人不知道咱们是火宗人啊？
对不起
干的好，姑娘们
戴笠一定会去通风报信的
第四个“脉轮”位于你的心脏
它与爱相关，易被悲伤阻塞
让你所有的忧伤呈现面前
你的确有巨大的伤悲
不过爱将给予你力量
它将围绕着你
气宗对你的爱仍未消失
它就在你的心中，不如将其转化成为新爱
让痛随风而逝
非常好
我能再喝点洋葱香蕉汁吗？
第五个脉轮位于咽喉，即为“声脉轮”
其由真相掌控，易被谎言阻塞
自欺欺人的谎言
你之前为什么不说你就是神通
因为我从来都不想当神通
你不能欺骗你的本性
你必须接受你是神通的事实
非常好，安昂
你已经打开了“真相脉轮”
第六个能量池是“光明脉轮”
其位于你的前额
其由你的洞察力掌控
易被幻觉阻塞
这世界最大的幻觉就是分离
我们认为互相孤立的事物
往往是一个统一的整体，就像...
就像这四大国
没错
我们都是一奶同胞，只不过分散居住而已
我们都是相互联系的
万物皆相连
没错，四种元素相生相克的现象
其实也是一种幻想
解放你的思想，你会发现
四种元素其实是一个统一的整体
四素归一，就连金属也是土的一部分
只不过是被提纯精炼了而已
破铁块，给我开
拓芙，你棒透了
我说模模，咱们在去见皇上之前喝杯茶怎样？
我要个两人桌
叔叔，两杯茉莉花茶
一杯绿茶，一杯荔枝茶
稍等，我这就沏好
这是最后一个脉轮了吧
没错，一旦你打开这个脉轮
你就可以随心所欲的出入神通形态
而且在神通形态中
你可以完全掌控自己的行为
那就开始吧
“思之脉轮”位于头冠处
它由纯净的宇宙能量所控制
却易被凡世牵挂所阻塞
仔细考虑一下你在这世上的牵绊吧
现在，放开所有的牵挂吧
让它们随波漂逝
忘记吧
什么？为什么你让我忘记卡塔拉
可我...我...我爱她啊
不忘记她，那纯净的宇宙能量
又怎能流入你的体内呢
宇宙能量难道比卡塔拉更重要吗？
我喜欢她又怎么能算是一件坏事呢？
在打开三个脉轮之前，还是件好事呢
你必须学会放手
还好你在这儿，苏琪，大事不好了
火宗人混入了都城
我刚才看到了祖寇和他的叔叔
我们得立刻上报土强王
哦，别担心，我一定会通知他的
这么说，祖祖也在城中喽
该是一家团聚的时候了
我很抱歉，不过我不会放你走的，卡塔拉
安昂，要掌握神通状态
你必需打开所有的脉轮
学会放下自我
好吧，我尽力而为
现在，面对你的那些牵绊
试着放弃它们
让纯净的宇宙能量流入
放我走！
卡塔拉有危险，我必须走
安昂，回来
如果继续痴迷于那些牵绊
脉轮将被封闭
如果你现在离开，你将不能进入神通形态
这肯定又是她在耍花招
箱子上都破了这么一个大洞
你见过这样的花招吗？
当然不是了
我可是来真的
我是这世上最厉害的御土师
你们两个笨蛋给我记住了
莫非我要跟你永远困在这儿了
我想上厕所
准备好去大败火宗了吗？
老爸，你不知道这对我有多重要
我会让你以我为傲的，
我要向您证明我是一名伟大的武士
索卡，你不用向我证明，我一直都以你为傲
我一直都认为你是名伟大的武士
真的吗？
不然我为何在走后把全部落都托付给你？
看来大事不妙
怎么回事？为什么你的部下大半夜的押我至此
你们不能这么对待虚子武士
可你又不是虚子武士
你好啊，烈火国的阿祖拉公主
你想怎样？
我想做个交易
该是我重掌永固城大权的时候了
而你有我要的东西
土强王的信任
我为什么要帮你？
因为我可以帮你抓到神通
洗耳恭听
皇上有旨
我...我不敢相信
上面写了什么，叔叔？
好消息
土强王邀请我们进宫奉茶
-=未完待续=-

水善国
土强国

降世神通 前情提要
感觉你好像有点不一样
真是个好兆头啊，皇叔
在城内我们可以出其不意
一举推倒土强王的政权
戴笠是关键
我想做笔交易
如果你想掌握神通状态
你必须打开所有的脉轮
卡塔拉有危险，我必须得走
安昂，别走
如果你在神通状态时被杀死
降世神通将不复存在
