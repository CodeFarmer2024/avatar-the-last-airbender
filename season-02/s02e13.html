Act I

(Opening shot of a group of Fire nation tanks rumbling across the barrens,
escorting a gigantic vehicle. When the shot pulls back it is seen to be a
titanic tunneling machine, 10 stories high and stretching back a great
distance. The tanks flanking it appear as little more than insignificant
toys by comparison. In another shot we are shown large segments of the
drill’s body pushing forward under steam power, punching steam driven
spikes into the ground, then contracting again to gain forward movement.
The camera pans fully back to show the entire length of the great Drill, a
vast black iron cylinder creeping forward like a caterpillar, the tanks
beside it ant-like. The shot switches to a top view, as a tower topped by
a command center levers upward from the drill’s back. Cut to the inside of
the c.c., where Azula is shown seated on a throne, flanked by Mai and Ty
Lee.)

War Minister Ching: (stepping into scene to address Azula) This drill is a
feat of scientific ingenuity and raw destructive power. Once it tunnels
through the wall, our troops will storm their city. The Earth kingdom will
finally fall, and you can claim Ba Sing Se in the name of your father.
Nothing can stop us.
Ty lee: (looking away from a periscope) Hmm. What about those muscle-y
guys down there‌

(She looks back into periscope, then cut to a view through the periscope,
where Earth kingdom benders are seen dropping into trenches. Switches to
exterior view, showing a series of large trenches dug in the shadow of the
wall, with the Fire nation forces approaching in the distance.)

War Minister Ching: (walks up and sharply raps the periscope, startling Ty
Lee) Please, the drill’s metal shell is impervious to any earthbending
attack.
Azula: (condescendingly) Oh, I’m sure it is War Minister Ching. But just
to be on the safe side…(in commanding tone) Mai, and Ty lee, take the
earthbenders out!
Mai: (twiddling knives) Finally, something to do.

(Cut to a scene of Katara, Sokka and Toph escorting Than and family out of
a rocky pass toward the base of the great wall. As they pause, Aang and
Momo swoop into view from the direction of the wall. Aang lands before
them, Momo perching on his shoulder.)

Katara: Aang, what are you doing here‌ I thought you were looking for
Appa‌
Aang: I was, but something stopped me. Something big.

(Cut to wall’s base, where Aang and Toph are jointly bending a rock
platform up the face of the wall, lifting them all upwards. Camera pans
back to show their rapid ascent up the wall.)

Sokka: (as platform ascends) Now what’s so big that Appa has to wait‌
Aang: That.

(The camera pans way back to show both the wall and the approaching Drill,
then to an aerial view showing the massive machine flanked by eight tanks
on either side.

Cut to Aang and the rest peering out over the top of the outer wall, down
toward the Fire nation forces.)

Ying: (despairingly) We made it to Ba Sing Se, and we’re still not safe.
No one is.

(Than and family huddle together.)

Earthbender Guard: (from behind) What are you people doing here‌ Civilians
aren’t allowed on the wall.
Aang: (looking determined) I’m the Avatar. Take me to whoever’s in charge.

(Cut to an area atop the outer wall where a roof is supported by tall
arches. An Earth kingdom general waits seated at a desk.)

General Sung: (smiling) It is an honor to welcome you to the outer wall
young Avatar, but your help is not needed.
Aang: Not needed‌
General Sung: (smugly) Not needed. I have the situation under control. I
assure you the Fire Nation cannot penetrate this wall. Many have tried to
break through it, but none have succeeded.

(The general rises as he speaks, leading the group back out towards an
open area of the wall manned by soldiers standing near large stacks of
boulders. We are shown an aerial view of the outer wall. Nothing lies
beyond the outer face but barren wastes, while a patchwork of fertile
fields grow behind it.

Cut to scene of the general gazing contentedly out over the inward face of
the wall, the heroes standing behind him.)

Toph: What about the Dragon of the West‌ He got in.
General Sung: (startled) Well…uh…technically yes. But he was quickly
expunged. (more confidently) Nevertheless, that is why the city is named
Ba Sing Se. It’s the impenetrable city. They don’t call it Na Sing Se.
(belly laughs, then becomes serious) That means penetrable city.
Toph: Yeah, thanks for the tour, but we still got the drill problem.
General Sung: (pacing back to look out over wastes) Not for long. To stop
it, I’ve sent an elite platoon of earthbenders called the Terra Team.
Sokka: (thoughtfully) That’s a good group name, very catchy.

(Cut to a scene of the Terra Team launching their assault on the Fire
nation forces. They propel one of the tanks into the air, then ride a
surge of earth through the gap left in the tank’s formation.)

Terra Team Leader: Ready… Attack!

(The earthbenders try to wedge several large pillars of stone against the
side of the Drill, but it shatters them effortlessly. The Terra Team
barely manages to raise a defensive shield against a barrage of Mai’s
throwing knives. Mai and Ty Lee are shown rappelling down the side of the
Drill toward them. Nimbly avoiding their earthbending attacks, Ty Lee
leaps in amongst them and begins delivering a flurry of pressure-point
attacks. One by one the Terra Team drop helplessly at her feet.)

General Sung: (observing from a telescope) We’re doomed! (flails arms in a
panic)
Sokka: (slaps general hard on the face) Get a hold of yourself man!
General Sung: (rubbing cheek) You’re right, I’m sorry.
Toph: Maybe you’d like the Avatar’s help now‌
General Sung: (meekly approaching Aang in a timid voice) Yes, please.

(Cut to Aang and friends looking out over the wall at the approaching
Drill)

Aang: The question is, how are we gonna stop that thing‌
Sokka: Why are you all looking at me‌
Aang: You’re the idea guy.
Sokka: (complaining) So I’m the only one who can ever come up with a plan‌
That’s a lot of pressure.
Katara: And also the complaining guy.
Sokka: That part I don’t mind.

(Cut to the Ferry Landing, then inside to the ticket gate. An Earth nation
official, a sour, heavy set woman with a large hairy mole above her
eyebrow, looks over Iroh and Zuko’s papers dubiously.)

Customs Lady: (sounding unpleasant) So, Mr. Lee, and Mr.… umm Mushy is it‌

Iroh: It’s pronounced Moo-shee.
Customs Lady: (looking up from papers angrily) You telling me how to do my
job‌
Iroh: (stepping closer) Uh, no no no. (speaking charmingly) But may I just
say that you’re like a flower in bloom, your beauty intoxicating.
Customs Lady: (smiling and obviously charmed) You’re pretty easy on the
eyes yourself handsome. (makes cat-claw gesture) Raorrr. Welcome to Ba
Sing se. (stamps their papers and pushes them forward.)
Zuko: (snatching his papers from Iroh disgustedly) I’m gonna forget I saw
that.

(Camera looks over Jet’s shoulder as he observes Zuko and Iroh stepping
past ticket gate.)

Jet: I think Lee would make a good Freedom Fighter. He’s just trying to
find his way in the world, like us.

(View changes to Jet, Smellerbee and Longshot standing side by side in
ticket line.)

Smellerbee: You don’t know anything about him Jet.
Jet: (holding signature grass stalk to mouth) I know he didn’t get that
scar from a waterbender.
Smellerbee: Besides, I thought we were going straight now‌
Jet: (shrugging) We are, and the new Freedom Fighters could use a guy like
Lee. What do you think Longshot‌
Longshot: (shoots a meaningful look) …
Jet: I can respect that.

(Cut to an enclosed Infirmary atop the outer wall, where the members of
the Terra Team lie on futons. General Sung, Aang , Sokka, Toph and Momo
watch as Katara spreads the blue energies of her healing technique over
the arm of one of the fallen warriors.)

General Sung: What’s wrong with him‌ He doesn’t look injured.
Katara: His Chi is blocked. (dissipates the energies) Who did this to you‌

Terra Team Soldier: (moaning) Two girls ambushed us, one of them hit me
with a bunch of quick jabs, and suddenly I couldn’t earthbend, and I could
barely move…and then she cart wheeled away. (recognition dawns in Katara’s
eyes)
Katara: (looking away thoughtfully) Ty lee. She doesn’t look dangerous,
but she knows the human body and it’s weak points. It’s like she takes you
down from the inside.
Sokka: ( an idea suddenly hits him and he begins gesturing wildly) Ooo,
ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo!
Katara: Yes‌
Sokka: (excitedly) What you just said, that’s how we’re gonna take down
the Drill. The same way Ty lee took down all these big earthbenders.
Toph: (enthusiastically) By hitting its pressure points!
Aang: (looking out a window at the Drill below) We’ll take it down from
the inside.

Act II

(Scene opens with a front view of the spinning face of the drill, flanked
by Fire nation tanks. Panning down, we see that ahead in its path Toph,
Aang, Momo, Katara and Sokka are crouched down in one of the Terra Team’s
abandoned trenches.)

Toph: (gesturing back towards the Drill) Once I whip up some cover, you’re
not gonna be able to see, so stay close to me.

(Leaping from the trench, Toph begins a strenuous earthbending gesture
that ends with a powerful foot stomp, sending a mighty blast of dust and
broken stone rocketing along the ground toward the drill.)

Toph: Run!

(Racing closely behind Toph, the team plunges into the swirling white dust
cloud. The scene cuts to the Drill Command Center, where Ty Lee is again
looking out through the periscope.)

Ty lee: (peering more closely) Hey, look at that dust cloud. (periscope
view shows front of drill and billowing cloud) It’s so…poofy. (looks back
to the others with a spaced-out expression) Poof!
War Minister Ching: Don’t worry Princess. I’m sure it’s nothing. (Azula
looks to Ching doubtfully)

(Cut to Toph and the rest running through the thick dust to emerge near
the front of the drill. Standing in the drill’s shadow, she bends open a
pit in the ground.)

Toph: Everyone into the hole!

(Toph hops down into the hole after the others, and the surface
immediately swirls shut above them. The camera pans down below ground and
into utter blackness)

Sokka: It’s so dark down here, I can’t see a thing.
Toph: (feigning horror) Oh no, what a nightmare.
Sokka: Sorry.

(Cut to the surface, underneath the drill, where the ground bulges upwards
and opens up. Toph emerges, followed by the others. They stand underneath
the Drill itself, a vast, gloomy region framed by long rows of tracked
wheels, with the Drill’s body as its ceiling.)

Sokka: (pointing ahead and upwards) There!

(An opening in the Drill’s belly is seen, with a narrow length of pipe
extending out of it horizontally. Aang leaps up to catch it and hangs
upside down from it by his legs. He catches Katara and then Sokka by the
hands, boosting them up into the Drill. There is a pause and we realize
that Toph is not following.)

Sokka: (peeking out upside down from the opening) Toph, Come on!
Toph: (looking resigned) No way am I going in that metal monster. I can’t
bend in there. I’ll try to slow it down out here.
Sokka: Okay, good luck. (both he and Aang disappear up into the Drill)

(Outside, Toph tries unsuccessfully to stop the forward movement of the
Drill by bending up an outcropping of stone, but both Toph and the brace
are pushed along by the unstoppable force of the Drill’s progress.
Cut to the Drill’s inner corridors, where Sokka leads the others through a
red-lit area of pipes and valves.

Sokka: (studying pipes) I need a plan of this machine. Some schematics
that show what the inside looks like. Then we can find it’s weak points.
Aang: Where are we gonna get something like that‌ (Sokka abruptly draws
his machete and chops off a steam valve) What are you doing!‌ Someone’s
gonna hear us!

(Aang looks about worriedly as the room begins to fill with steam.)

Sokka: (confidently) That’s the point. I figure a machine this big needs
engineers to run it, and when something breaks…
Katara: They come to fix it.

(Aang and Katara exchange pleased smiles. Moments later, a large Fire
Nation engineer in a filter mask appears through the steam holding a large
wrench and a rolled up document.)

Katara: (appearing behind him) Hi.

(Katara bends the steam, condensing it into an icy shell that entraps the
engineer.)

Sokka: (runs up and takes plans) This’ll work, thanks!

(Runs off, leaving the engineer standing helplessly, eventually dropping
the wrench in his other hand.

Cut to Sokka leading the others up metal stairs, stopping to unroll the
plans across a large pipe.)

Sokka: (studying cross-diagram of Drill) It looks like the Drill is made
up of two main structures. There’s the inner mechanism, where we are now,
and the outer shell. (traces his finger along diagram while speaking) The
inner part and the outer part are connected by these braces. If we cut
through them, the entire thing will collapse.

(Both Aang and Katara nod in agreement and they all race off-screen.

Cut to debarkation point for Ba Sing Se, which resembles a large stone
train station. People are milling about in groups, and the scene shifts to
Zuko and Iroh, who are seated with arms crossed at a waiting area. Jet
casually sits down next to Zuko.)

Jet: So, you guys got plans once you’re inside the city‌
Tea Peddler: Get your hot tea here! Finest tea in Ba Sing Se!

(All three look up to see a tea merchant pushing a concession cart in
front of them.)

Iroh: (waving an arm) Oh! Jasmine, please. (the peddler pours tea into
Iroh’s bowl, who delightedly takes a sip. His eyes widen in shock and he
spits it out in disgust) Blaugh! Ugh. Coldest tea in Ba Sing Se is more
like it. What a disgrace!
Jet: Hey, can I talk to you for a second‌ (gestures for Zuko, who seems to
be ignoring the tea episode, to follow him)
Zuko: (rising reluctantly) Sigh.
Jet: (walking away from where Iroh sits) You and I have a much better
chance of making it in the city if we stick together. You want to join the
Freedom Fighters‌
Zuko: Thanks, but I don’t think you want me in your gang.
Jet: Come on, we made a great team looting that Captain’s food. Think of
all the good we could do for these refugees.
Zuko: (turning and walking back towards Iroh) I said no.
Jet: (mildly surprised) Have it your way.

(Jet focuses in on the seated Iroh, who is carefully enjoying the tea now
steaming vigorously in his cup. Jet suddenly bristles and his eyes open
wide in shock, realizing what he is seeing. Reaching Iroh, Zuko looks back
toward Jet, who now wears a look of hostile suspicion on his face. Jet
turns and walks off.

Watching Jet leave, Zuko abruptly turns and dashes the cup of tea from his
uncle’s hand.)

Iroh: (surprised) Hey!
Zuko: (whispering through gritted teeth) What are you doing firebending
your tea‌ For a wise old man, that was a pretty stupid move.
Iroh: (mournfully) I know you’re not supposed to cry over spilled tea, but
*sniffle*…(cup is shown overturned in a puddle) .. that’s so sad.

(Cut to another aerial view of the approaching Drill and its tank escort.
Scene changes to the interior of Drill, with Sokka leading the others out
a doorway and onto a massive steel beam.)

Sokka: (studying plans) Wow, it looks a lot thicker in person than it does
in the plans. We’re going to have to work pretty hard to cut through that.

Katara: (crossing arms) What’s this we stuff‌ Aang and I are going to have
to do all the work.
Sokka: (turns and gestures to self) Look, I’m the plan guy, You two (makes
rapid chop-chop gestures) are the “cut stuff up with waterbending” guys.
(strikes a heroic pose) Together, we’re Team Avatar!

(Aang and Katara exchange mortified looks. Katara is then shown bending
the water out of her flask, sending it to ring against the edge of a
vertical beam before being caught by Aang, who bends it back towards her
along the same path. As the water zings back in forth, a cut begins to
form in the side of the thick beam. Wearing looks of strenuous
concentration, Aang and Katara again and again send the water scything
back through the diagonal cut. Moving forward to a point where the cut has
reached the midway point through the beam, Katara and Aang are shown bent
over and gasping with exhaustion.)

Sokka: (pumping arms in the air) C’mon team, don’t quit now, we’re…
Katara: (explodes with frustration) Grrrrrr! (shoots a menacing glare back
at Sokka, who stands wide-eyed, arms still in air)
Sokka: I mean, (recovers and points reassuringly) you’re almost there.

(The two of them resume slicing away at the girder little by little. Sokka
watches on, an eager look of anticipation growing on his face. Finally the
beam is cut completely in two, and the upper section grinds down the
angled cut a few inches before screeching to a halt.)

Katara: (clearly exhausted) At this rate, we won’t do enough damage before
the drill reaches the wall.
Aang: (sitting down to rest) I don’t know how many more of those I have in
me.

(An ominous shudder and low moan passes down the length of the Drill.)

Sokka: Do you hear that‌ We took it down. We better get out of here fast!

(As they race away, they pause at a doorway as a voice comes down from
overhead speaking tubes.)

War Minister Ching: Congratulations crew, the Dill has made contact with
the wall of Ba Sing Se. (cut to view of Ching in command center) Start the
countdown to victory!

(Azula is shown with an unreadable expression on her face, Followed by the
Drill’s titanic bit penetrating into the surface of the outer wall.)

Act III

(The scene opens with a high aerial view of the Drill as it starts to bore
into the outer wall. A different view shows the rubble from the wall being
saturated with moisture as it is conveyed backwards through the Dill. The
camera follows the slurry back through a thick pipe to where Sokka is
shown struggling futilely against the severed girder.)

Sokka: (grimacing) C’mon brace, budge!

(Camera pans back to show everyone else resting on the large horizontal
beam, while Sokka makes several efforts to push the severed one.)

Katara: This is bad, really bad.
Sokka: Were putting everything we’ve got into busting these braces, but
it’s taking too long!
Aang: (suddenly inspired) Maybe we don’t need to cut all the way through.
Toph has been teaching me that you shouldn’t give 100% of your energy into
any one strike. (levitates to his feet) Sokka, take a fighting stance.
You’ve gotta be quick and accurate. (hooks a foot around one of Sokka’s
ankles, pulling him off balance) Hit a series of points, and break your
opponent’s stance.(hits him with a series of pretend blows) And when he’s
reeling back, you deliver the final blow.(bonks him lightly on the head)
His own weight becomes his downfall. Literally.

(A he finishes speaking, Sokka collapses forward comically.)

Katara: So we just need to weaken the braces, instead of cut all the way
through.
Aang: (pointing upward) Then I’ll go to the top of this thing, and deliver
the final blow.
Sokka: (raising arms) And boom, it all comes crashing down! (sweeps arms
down)
Aang: (passionately) Everyone inside that wall, the whole world, is
counting on us.
Sokka: The whole world, minus the Fire Nation that is.

(Sokka grins, while others look exasperate.

Cut to the underside of the Drill, where Toph still struggles mightily to
slow its advance with a stone brace, which merely results in a pile of
loose earth growing behind her feet as both she and the brace are drug
along.)

Toph: (straining) C’mon twinkle toes, hurry up!

(Back inside the Drill’s superstructure, we are shown scenes of Katara and
Aang inflicting cuts into various support beams.)

Aang: That’s enough, we need to get to the next one!

(Cut to the outside, as earthbender’s push wave after wave of boulders
from the top of the outer wall. They ring harmlessly off of its hull and
drop to the side. Cut to the Drill command center, where Azula , War
Minister Ching and the rest of the crew listen to messages coming from the
various speaking tubes.)

Speaking Tube 1: (alarmed) War Minister, an engineer was ambushed! His
schematics were stolen!

(The War Minister looks shocked, while Azulas eyes narrow in suspicion.)

Speaking Tube 2: (alarmed) War Minister, a brace on the starboard side has
been cut clean through! It’s sabotage sir!

(The War Minister is frozen in terror, watching Azula from the corners of
his eyes.)

Azula: (turning from Ching to Mai and Ty Lee) Let’s go ladies.

(Cut to the Dril’sl superstructure, where Aang and Katara continue their
sabotage.)

Sokka: (Encouragingly) Good work Team Avatar. Now Aang just needs to
(glances up)… DUCK!

(He ducks and covers just in time to avoid a blast of blue flame. Azula,
Mai and Ty Lee run out onto another massive girder well above Aang and
friends.)

Aang: (narrowly avoiding a second blast) Whoa!
Ty lee: Wow Azula, you were right, it is the Avatar! (smiles
seductively)…and friends.
Sokka: (smiles vacantly and waves) Hey.

(Katara marches past and yanks him o.c. As her allies rush o.c. to pursue,
Ty Lee drops to the bottom edge of the girder and swings out towards Aang,
who throws her backwards with a gust of wind. Aang and his friends are
shown fleeing down corridors, when Aang comes to a halt at a T
intersection.)

Aang: Guys get out of here, I know what I need to do. (heads other
direction with Momo)
Katara: Wait! You need this water more than I do!

(As Aang turns, she draws out her flask of bending water and throws it to
him. Sokka and Katara rush down a corridor, while Aang and Momo head the
opposite direction.)

Azula: (reaching intersection) Follow them, the Avatar is mine. (Azula
races off after Aang, while Mai and Tai Lee pursue the others)

(Cut to Katara and Sokka reaching a dead end, with a large hatch marked by
a sign written in kanji.)

Katara: (as Sokka struggles with hatch) Slurry pipeline‌ What does that
mean‌
Sokka: (finally opening hatch, peering into it with Katara) It’s rock and
water mixed together, it means our way out.

(As Katara begins to lower herself into the slurry pipe, Mai and Ty Lee
suddenly arrive on the scene. Katara lets go and plunges in followed by
Sokka, just as Mai’s throwing knives ricochet off the open slurry hatch.
Both splash into the slurry neck-deep and are quickly swept away by the
current. Cut back to Mai looking down into the slurry flow.)

Mai: (completely revolted) Ughh, disgusting!
Ty lee: (peering down) Come on, you heard Azula. We have to follow them.
Mai: She can shoot all the lightning she wants at me, I am not going in
that wall sludge juice.

(Mai shudders. Ty Lee hops down into the slurry flow, sending up a great
spash that narrowly misses Mai. With a final expression of disgust Mai
slams closed the slurry hatch.

Cut to scene of Aang racing through the Drill’s engineering section with
airbending speed, past engineers who barely detect him through their
respirator masks. Aang finally races up a long ladder toward the Drill’s
surface.

Cut to an overview of the Drill showing a large pool of slurry starting to
form at its rear. Screaming with fear, Sokka and Katara ride the cascade
of slurry out the rear spout of the Drill, sliding to a halt in the
grayish ooze. Sokka tries to wipe the revolting stuff off of his tongue,
pounds his fists into the slurry in disgust. Ty Lee emerges from pipe
exhaust, riding waist deep in the sluffy flow with a look of wicked
anticipation on her face. Just as she is about to reach the ground, Katara
bends back the rush of slurry, pinning Ty Lee at the terminus of the
pipe.)

Katara: (fiercely) Why don’t you try blocking my chi now circus freak!
(stands resolutely with one hand upraised)
Sokka: Katara, keep that up. The pressure will build up in the drill, then
when Aang delivers the final blow, it will be ready to pop!

(Cut to Aang and Momo emerging from an opening onto the Drill’s upper
hull. The pair start racing towards the front of the Drill, which has
already penetrated deep into the wall.)

Aang: (pausing) This looks like a good spot Momo. (glances up, and barely
avoids the large boulder that bounces off where he was standing) Aggh!
(dodges a second and third boulder as they continue to rain down from
above)
Aang: (shouting upward) General Sung, tell your soldiers to stop shooting
rocks down here!
General Sung: (looking down from a great height, he apparently doesn’t
hear) Soldiers, whatever you do, don’t stop shooting rocks down there!

(Sung draws his hands up to his face in distress, while the row of benders
next to him release another volley of boulders.

Below, Aang vaults past this new wave of stones, and as he lands, begins
rapidly scything the surface of the drill with the water Katara gave to
him. The camera pans the entire length of the Drill. At its rear, Katara
continues to block the pipe’s exhaust with a slurry ball containing Ty
Lee.)

Sokka: (in lecturing tone) Good technique little sister! Keep it up! Don’t
forget to breathe!
Katara: (losing temper) You know, I am just about sick and tired of you
telling me what to do all day. You’re like a chattering Hog-Monkey!
Sokka: (screaming) Just bend the slurry woman!!

(Katara bends up a rush of slurry with her free hand, launching him up to
plunge back down into the foul muck.)

Toph: (emerging from beneath the Drill) You guys need some help‌
Katara: Toph, help me plug up this drain!

(Bracing her muddy legs she coordinates with Katara, driving the
slurry-plug even further up the pipe. Switching to an internal view of the
Drill, we see the slurry pipe system begin to buckle and swell under the
pressure.

Cut back to the front of the Drill, where fountains of slurry begin to jet
where the Drill meets the wall. Nearby Aang continues to rapidly cut away
at the outer hull in an X pattern.)

Aang: (winded) What I’d give to be a metal bender.

(Momo, perched on Aang’s shoulder, turns and give out a warning cry,
allowing Aang to turn and deflect a deadly blast of blue fire. Momo
narrowly avoids the flame.)

Aang: Momo, get out of here!

(Momo flies off as Aang assumes a stance.

The camera follows Azula’s shadow to Azula herself, as she readies a
stance with a look of steady confidence, then back to Aang who looks
nowhere near as sure of himself. It pulls back to show the two benders
facing off about a dozen yards apart atop the Drill. Azula begins by
launching a ball of fire at Aang, who ducks and simultaneously sends an
arc of wind towards her. Leaping over the windblast, Azula once again
attacks, but is forced to counter a rapid series of water-whips that keep
slapping away her attack gestures. Leaping into the air, Azula delivers a
pair of flying firebending kicks that completely vaporize the water Aang
was bending sending him spinning back. She is prevented from pressing the
attack however, as another barrage of boulders from above force both of
them to dodge. Aang catches one of the boulders with bending, sending it
hurtling at Azula who falls into a split to avoid it, rises, and launches
another fire blast. Aang earthbends pieces of debris into a protective
wall, then punches chunks of it toward Azula. Kicking them out of the air,
she launches a sweeping counter blast which barely misses Aang’s head, who
responds by punching an even larger chunk towards her. Vaulting into the
air, Azula executes an incredible forward spinning double-kick fire blast,
obliterating his defensive wall and hurtling him backwards to slam against
the outer wall.

Readying another attack, Azula pauses as she sees the Avatar drop to his
knees and slump forward unconscious. Aang is seen from above sprawled
against the Drill’s hull. Azula is jarred by the forward advance of the
drill, and the massive bit is shown bursting through the other side of the
outer wall. Cuts to an overview showing the great Drill piercing
completely through the wall, then back to a shot of Aang being slowly
pulled underneath the walls exterior by the forward progress of the Drill.
Azula grabs him by the back of his collar and presses him upright against
the wall. Aang slowly begins to rouse, and the camera switches to Aang’s
p.o.v. as we see a blurry Azula preparing to deliver the final blow.
Closeup of Aang’s eye snapping open in alarm, then his right hand cracking
open the surface of the wall and surrounding itself with a mitt of broken
rock. He catches Azula’s fire punch in the rock mitt and shoves her far
back with it, her steel shod boots sparking against the Drill’s hull. Aang
strikes a defiant earthbending stance as Azula charges towards him, both
hands ablaze.

The battle is suddenly interrupted by a blast of slurry that erupts at the
point where the Drill meets the wall, throwing Aang from his feet before
surging out to crash against the onrushing Fire princess. Aang flails
about trying to regain his feet, and just manages to make it to his knees
before Azula, arms windmilling, skates helplessly through the slop to send
them both careening into the wall. Knocked momentarily senseless, they
both slide face-first through the slurry and away from the wall, diverging
to slip down opposite sides of the Drill. Recovering, Azula tries to stop
her descent using her hands and feet, her steel-toed boots sparking. She
manages to stop herself midway down the side of the Drill, clutching at it
precariously. Aang meanwhile slides down his back, his rock mitt breaking
apart as he tries to stop himself with it. He is rescued by Momo, swooping
down, catching the back of his collar and pulling him upright so that he
can use his swift-running technique to regain the top of the Drill. Aang
leaps back onto the back of the Drill, and Momo settles on his shoulder.)

Aang: (scratching Momo’s head) Thanks Momo, I owe you one.

(Aang walks along the Drill’s back, through the slurry mess, to stop at
the X cut into the plating.)

Aang: Now all I need is a…(boulder crashes down startling him) Actually,
that is what I needed for once.

(Bending the boulder around to the incision, he begins a series of
sweeping earthbending moves, each one slicing away a large chunk of the
boulder. Eventually he is left with a large stone spike pointed down into
the breach. Aang drops back, falls into a sprinter’s stance and starts
running toward the wall. Nearing it he bends up a ball of air and leaps
atop it, riding up the sheer face of the outer wall. As he rockets up the
wall the ball dissipates, and Aang begins to run up the vertical face. As
his momentum falls away, he turns and we see that Aang has nearly reached
the top of the outer wall, the Drill far below him.

With a powerful shout Aang completes his turn and wind-sprints downward at
a fantastic speed. Meanwhile, Azula having finally crawled back up to the
top of the Drill, spots Aang streaking down face of the wall. With a
shout, Aang leaps free of the wall and plunges downward, as we cut to
Azula preparing a potent blast to intercept him. Her attack passes just
over Aang’s head as he strikes the spike with incredible force. The
explosive shockwave hurls a screaming Azula through the air as it travels
the length of the Drill. Cut to the superstructure of the Drill, where we
see weakened beams begin to shear in half as torrents of slurry rush past.
Cut to an exterior view of the entire Drill, as a chain of slurry
eruptions begin at the front segment and work their way towards the rear.
Cut to Toph and Katara, still in bending stances, with Sokka standing
behind them.)

Toph: Here it comes! (begins raising the three of them up on a pillar of
rock)

(As the rock pillar rises from the lake of slurry, a great rush of it
issues from the exhaust spout. Ty Lee is washed up against the pillar,
slammed against it and held there by the powerful current. Safe atop the
pillar, Toph and the Water siblings watch as one by one the segments of
the Drill slump to a stop, great clouds of steam rising from them. On the
other side of the wall we see the massive bit slowly stop rotating. Cut to
a high aerial view showing the remains of the steaming drill nearly
submerged in slurry. Cut back to a mud-covered Aang standing atop of the
stone spike, as the sun sets in the background.

Wiping the mud from his face, he reveals an enormous grin. Momo lands on
his muddy shoulder and starts licking the slurry from his forehead. Cut to
a view through the mud-covered windshield of the Drill command center. As
the mud slides away it reveals War Minister Ching, standing with an
expression of horror and amazement. In another shot we follow a long
streak of mud that had exploded up the face of the wall. General Sung
stands there completely covered in mud, as it drips away to reveal the
pathetic expression on his face.

Cut to Ty Lee sitting up from the slurry pool, wiping clear her face, and
spitting out a mouthful of mud in disgust. Azula slides down the back of
the Drill, dropping down next to her and splashing her with a fresh layer
of mud. Azula looks back to see a steaming hatch open in the rear of the
drill, revealing a somber Mai.

Mai: We lost.

(Cut to the Train Station where an ornate stone train has arrived to pick
up passengers.)

Conductor: (voice over) Last call for Ba Sing se!

(Cut to Jet striding angrily toward the train, flanked by Smellerbee and
Longshot.)

Smellerbee: Jet, relax! So the old guy had some hot tea. Big deal.
Jet: He heated it himself! (close-up of furious Jet) Those guys are
firebenders.

(Cut to a scene of the train, showing Iron and Zuko boarding a car in the
background, pulling back to show Jet, Smellerbee and Longshot watching
them. Jet raises his collar and Longshot pulls down his hat as they
attempt to look inconspicuous as they board a few cars down.

Cut to train car interior as Zuko and Iroh enter, where we see Than and
family already seated. Zuko sits down with his arms crossed, still
obviously angry. Iroh, sitting down between Zuko and Ying, glances at his
nephew before leaning over and smiling at Ying. She is cradling a sleeping
Hope in her lap while a grinning Than has his arm draped over her
shoulders.)

Iroh: What a handsome baby. (tickles her blanket with his finger)
Ying: Thank you.

(The camera closes in on Hope’s peacefully sleeping face while her mother

Cut to a shot of the rear of the train, as two earthbenders begin to scoot
it forward with a grinding noise. We follow the train out of the station.
The scene cuts back to show the train traveling on a raised track over
sunset lit fields.

Cut to a shot of Toph, Aang, Momo, Sokka and Katara watching the sun set
over the barrens from atop the outer wall.)

Sokka: (enthusiastically) I just want to say, good effort out there today
Team Avatar.
Katara: (slightly annoyed) Enough with the Team Avatar stuff. No matter
how many times you say it, it’s not gonna catch on.
Sokka: How about…(whips out boomerang, startling Momo) the “Boomerang
Squad!”, see it’s good cause it’s got “Aang” in it. (puts hand on Aang’s
head) Boomer-Aang.
Aang: I kinda like that one.
Katara: Let’s talk about this on our way into the city.

(She and the others start walking away.)

Sokka: The “Aang Gang”‌
Katara: Sokka.
Sokka: The “Fearsome Foursome”‌
Toph: You’re crazy.
Sokka: (now alone) Why‌ We’re fearsome!

第十三回
巨钻
这巨钻可是一项伟大的科学壮举
它拥有巨大的破坏力量
等它钻穿城墙
我们的大军就可以长驱直入
土强国即将土崩瓦解
您就可以您父皇的名字来命名这座都城了
没有什么可以阻挡我们
嗯，好像前面正有几个肌肉男在挡路
拜托
任何御土术的攻击都不能破坏巨钻的金属外壳
哦，你说的对 卿部长
不过小心点总没有坏处
梅，泰丽，把那几个御土师给我收拾了
终于有事做了
安昂，你怎么回来了
你不是应该去找阿柏吗？
没错，不过被件事耽搁了
这事可是非同小可啊
有什么事能比找阿柏更重要
就是它
好不容易才到了永固城
没想到这里也不安全
没有一个地方是安全的
你们几个到这儿来干嘛？
城墙上禁止平民闲晃
我是降世神通，带我去见你们的长官
欢迎您大驾光临永固城的外城
不过您多虑了？
多虑了？
没错
一切尽在我的掌握之中
我向您保证，火宗人不可能钻透城墙
之前也有人妄图穿墙而过
不过都以失败而告终
那西方神龙呢?他可是攻进了
那个...呃...确实没错
不过他很快就被击退了
无论如何，永固城可不是浪得虚名的
这座城市固若金汤
所以才不叫它“不固城”
（Na Sing Se=Nothing save? 不安全）
是有一定道理的
是啊，谢谢你的导游，不过这巨钻仍是个大麻烦
放心，我已经派了..
一支名为“泥球队”的精锐部队前去阻止了
真是个好名字，让人印象深刻
准备，进攻
我们完蛋了
你给我振作一点
你说的对，抱歉
现在你该需要神通的帮助了吧？
是的，拜托了
问题是，我们怎样才能阻止那个家伙
你们看我干什么？
谁让你是“主意男”来着
这么说只有我一个人能想出点子来啊
压力好大啊
差点忘了，你还是“牢骚男”来着
发点牢骚又无伤大雅
是李先生和...呃，“牧师”先生对吗？
应该念做“木须”
用你来对我指手画脚啊？
岂敢岂敢
没人说你就像支盛开的花一样美丽吗？
你的美真是沁人心脾啊
帅哥，那就让你看个够吧
欢迎来到永固城
就当我没看到
我相信李会成为一位不错的自由战士
他和我们一样，都在
寻求着自己的人生道路
杰，你并不了解他
他脸上的那道疤可不是御水师弄的
再说了，你觉得现在咱们是走上正途了吗？
那还用说，新的自由战士团队需要像李这样的人
“善射”你觉得呢？
我会考虑的
他怎么了？看起来并没有受伤啊
他的气被闭塞了
这是谁干的？
两个丫头伏击了我们
其中一个快速的在我身上戳了几下
我突然间就不能用御土术了，全身动弹不得
然后她就消失了
是泰丽
她虽然看起来柔弱
可她却深知人体结构和弱点所在
没有外伤，却像在身体里给了你几拳
咋啦？
你刚才所说的
就是我们干掉那个巨钻的方法
就用泰丽击倒大块头御土师的方法
攻击它的弱点
让我们从里面把它卸了
我弄个烟雾阵做掩护，烟尘大很难看清
所以一定要在我后面紧跟了
跑！
嘿，快看那片烟尘
看起来真是“滚滚的”，是叫“滚”吧
（poofy：脂粉气的，poof：吹蜡烛声）
别担心公主殿下，没什么怕的
大家快进洞
这下面好黑啊，我啥也看不清
哦，不好哦，还真糟呢
抱歉
从那儿进
拓芙，快点啊
我可不想进到那个金属怪物的肚子里
在那儿御土术都用不了
我在这儿想办法减慢它的速度
那好吧，祝你好运
我需要一张蓝图，知道这儿的结构
才能找出它的弱点所在
我们上哪儿去搞那东西去？
你这是干嘛？有人会听见我们的
就是为了让他们听见
这么个大家伙肯定会有技师来打理
如果有东西坏了的话...
他们一定会去修的
嗨
你真是帮大忙了，谢啦
看来这个巨钻由两个主要结构组成
我们在的地方就是内层机构
另外一部分就是外壳
内外两层由这些支柱连接
如果我们把这些支柱弄断
那整个钻头就散架了
我说，你们做好进城后的打算了吗？
好喝的热茶啊！全永固城最好的茶！
哦！来杯茉莉花茶吧
呸！呃，全永固城最凉的茶还差不多
真可恶！
嘿，能和你聊聊吗？
如果你我合作的话
可以让这个城市变的更好
愿意成为自由战士的一员吗？
谢了，你的好意我领了，我无意加入
来吧，顺船长食物的那一票咱们配合的不错
我们还能为这些难民做更多事情
我说过不了
那就不强求了
嘿！
你干嘛在大庭广众之下用御火术？
你做事一向谨慎，怎么会做出这种傻事来
你可能觉得因为一杯撒了的茶哭不值得，不过
我真的好伤心啊
哇哦，没想到这支柱居然有一人多厚
要把它弄断看来没那么容易
别老咱咱的，其实只有我和安昂在干活
各有分工嘛，我负责想主意
你们负责用御术锯柱子
齐心协力，我们就是“神通队”
加油啊伙计们，别轻言放弃，咱们...
我是说，你们就快成功了
按照这个速度，不可能在
巨钻到达城墙之前把它搞垮
我不知道自己还能撑多久
听到了吗？我们成功了，咱们最好赶快离开这儿
报告大家一个好消息
咱们的巨钻已经到达永固城的城墙之下了
胜利指日可待
拜托了支柱，动一下
真糟，真是太糟了
咱们在这些柱子上耗了太多时间了
也许我们不需要把他们都弄断
拓芙曾经教过我，每次进攻必须倾注全力
索卡，试着攻击我
你必须要快而准
击中一系列的穴位，就可以破解敌人的招式
在他挣扎着恢复的时候，给他最后一击
毫不夸张地说，他自身的重量就可让他倒下
所以说我们只需削弱支柱，而不用费力全都弄断
之后我们只要爬到巨钻之上，给他最后一击
它就会乖乖的散架了
城中的人民，乃至整个世界都指望我们了
当然“整个世界&quot;不包括火宗的人
加油啊“亮脚趾”，快点啊
这个行了，咱们接着弄下一个
军部长，一个技师遭人暗算
他的图表被偷了
军部长，右舷的一个支柱已被完全切断
被人蓄意破坏了
女士们，该咱们上场了
干的好“神通队”，
现在安昂只需上...钻头顶部！
哇哦，阿祖拉，你说的对
是降世神通...还有他的朋友们
嘿
你俩快出去吧，我知道该怎么办
等等，这些水你更需要
跟着他们，神通就交给我了
泥浆管道？这是干啥用的？
就是输送石头和水混合物的管道
也就是咱们的逃生通道
呃，真恶心
走吧，阿祖拉发话了，咱们得跟着他们
她要是不满意就一个闪电劈死我算了
我可不想跳进这烂泥汤里
看你还怎么作怪，你这个马戏团的小丑
卡塔拉，顶住
这会使巨钻内部产生压力
只要安昂给它最后一击，它就废了
模模，就在这儿结果它吧
孙将军，叫士兵停止向这儿发射石头
士兵们，不管你们怎么做
就是别停止向那儿发射石头
妹妹，技术不错嘛
坚持住啊，气息很重要啊
别老是告诉我应该做什么，今天我真是受够你了
你简直就像个会说话的肥猪猴一样
少废话，干好你的活！
你们需要帮助吗？
拓芙，帮我把这个下水道塞上
这儿要是有个御金属师就好了
模模，快离开这儿
多谢你模模，你救了我一命
我现在只要....
事实上，这正是我想要的
成功了
我们败了
去往永固城的乘客请赶快上车
杰，放轻松
那老头只不过喝个热茶而已，有啥大不了的
他是自己弄热的，那俩人是火宗人
这小孩好俊啊
谢谢
我只是想说，今天“神通队”干的不错
别老“神通队”“神通队”的
不管你说多少遍，这名字一样没有感染力
那你看
“飞去飞来队”咋样？
这名字多好，还有个“安昂”在里面
“Boomer-Aang”
（Boomerang, 飞去飞来，Boomer-Aang，谐音）
这名字还不错
咱们还是边进城边说吧
“安昂帮”怎么样？
索卡
那就“可怕四人组”吧
你别疯了
咋了，咱们是挺可怕的嘛！
-=未完待续=-

水善国
土强国
火烈国
气和国
很久以前，这四大国和谐共处
然而，烈火国发起的战争结束了和平
只有同时掌握四种元素的降世神通才能结束战争
然而在大家最需要他的时候，他却消失了
年后，我和哥哥发现了转世的降世神通，
他是个御气师，名叫“安昂”
尽管他的御气术着实厉害
在拯救苍生之前，他要学的还有很多
但是我坚信
安昂 能拯救这个世界
-=降世神通=-
最后的气宗

降世神通 前情提要
&lt;i&gt;阿柏被偷走了&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;我们希望在永固城能找到它&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;敝人翟博士，永固城大学人类学的学科带头人&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;据说这座图书馆收藏了大量的知识&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;火宗人在日食日不能使用使用御术&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;我们得去永固城，把这个消息告诉给土强王&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;你怎么能在大庭广众之下使用御火术&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;那老头不就是喝了杯热茶嘛，有什么大不了的&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;他是自己弄热的&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;那两个人是火宗人&lt;/i&gt;
第二卷
土
第十四卷
围墙迷城
看，那就是内城墙了
没想到咱们居然能活着来到永固城
嘿，别太乐观
没准还有什么巨大的、能爆炸的
火宗铲土机来攻击咱们呢
也许整个都城会被淹没于水下
到处都是虾兵蟹将
你不是又喝仙人掌汁了吧？
我只是想说，咱们周围总是有怪事发生
别担心，安昂
咱们会找到阿柏的
这座都城可不小
就阿柏那个块头，怎么可能藏得住啊？
又回到城市里了，真是太棒了
咋了？这儿不是很棒吗？
到处都是墙
到处都有清规戒律
不信你就等着瞧，不出几天你就会讨厌这里了
伙计，我这就去找你
它就在这儿，我能感觉的到
你们好，我叫朱蒂
能够作为神通在永固城的向导
我真是太荣幸了
你们想必就是索卡，卡塔拉和拓芙吧
欢迎来到这座奇迹之城，咱们这就开始？
好的
我们带来了有关火宗军队的消息
想立刻呈递给土强王
太好了
那咱们就开始观光了
最后一站将是你们在这儿的新家
你们一定会喜欢的
可能你没有听清楚
我们得跟土强王唠唠战争的事，这十分重要
这儿可是永固城，没有哪比这儿更安全的了
这里是外环
这墙是用来干什么的？
哦，永固城有许多城墙
有的在外围用来保护我们的安全
还有一些在城内，用来维持秩序
这里是供新进城的人居住的地方
当然这里还住着木匠、铁匠之流
住这儿的人都是手艺人
看这儿，多么的古雅而又生机勃勃啊
不过在这儿行走也要多加小心
为什么要把穷人都围在这里居住？
所以我以前都不会来这儿
我老早就听说过这儿的生活方式
与僧侣们传授的那种相去甚远
我只是想让咱们的新住所看上去好一点
没准某人哪天就会带个女朋友回来呢
这座城就像个监狱一样
我可不想在这儿开枝散叶
生活在哪儿都可以扎根
不管你是否刻意播种
打起精神来，我给咱俩找了份新工作
今天下午就上岗
看看，火宗人居然就混在咱们当中
杰，那个老头不过是拿着杯热茶罢了
不能证明他是火宗人啊，就算他是
我们就该去攻击他们吗？
我原以为咱们已经告别过去
另觅新生了
没错
等我找到证据，就报告给捕快
剩下的交给他们来处理
行吗？
这是永固城的中环
这里可是商业中心哦
商店、饭店随处可见，大学也在这里
我们之前曾经见过一位永固城大学的教授
他带我们去了座古老的地下图书馆
在那我们发现了关于战争的情报
这消息十分重要，必须上报给土强王
这儿的历史很让人着迷吧？
看，这是中环最古老的建筑之一，城镇礼堂
这女的是不是聋了？
我跟她说的话，她肯定一句也没落
这就叫“熟视无睹”，你习惯就好了
(be handled : 处理)
呃，你们现在已经
很像专业的茶馆店小二了
感觉怎么样？
太可笑了
呃，这制服有更大号的吗？
我记得好像还有
我去找找看，你们先喝杯茶
呃~这茶怎么跟热水冲的树叶汁一个味
皇叔，茶不就是那么个东西吗
咱们可是一家人
你怎么能说出这种话呢？
咱们得好好整顿整顿这里
内环是达官贵族居住的地方
你们的居所就在附近
那面高墙里面是什么？
那些穿袍子的丑男是干嘛的？
那里面就是皇宫啦
那些人是名为“戴笠”的特工
该组织隶属于永固城的文化部
他们为我们的传统保驾护航
我们现在能去土强王吗？
哦，还不行，没谁可以冒然拜见土强王的
我们到了，这就是你们的新家
还有个好消息，你们请求拜见
土强王的请求已经被批下来了
大概一个月左右就能安排你们觐见
比平常快多了
要一个月！
具体说，需要六至八周
这儿不错吧？希望你们能在这过得愉快
能过的愉快才怪呢
没事只能在这儿消磨时间
不能再快点吗？
土强王管理的可是世界上最好的城市
他每天都要日理万机
如果时间允许的话
他会尽快召见你们的
如果要在这儿耗上一个月
咱们应该多花点时间去找阿柏
我很乐意护送你们去任何地方
我们可不需要保姆
哦，我不会阻碍你们的
再说了不管你们也不是待客之道啊
开始今天的行程吧？
抱歉，我从没听说过飞天野牛
原来还有这种动物呢
如果有人偷了动物而不想让别人知道
他们一般会去哪儿销赃？
黑市在哪儿？是谁在经营？
快说，你肯定知道
开黑市可是犯法的
你们还是赶快走吧
你的狐猴把我的麻雀珍珠鸡都吓坏了
在这附近，我可没见过有御沙者或是游牧者
你去问问翟教授吧，他在这儿主讲沙漠文化
好吧，那关于“与烈火国交战”的问题
我该请教哪位教授呢？
我不知道，我不是政治学的学生，我得去上课了
那个，抱歉没人见过你的野牛
你们不妨去休息一下吧
一会儿有人会送晚餐过来的
嘿，跟我来
你是降世神通吧，听说你进城了，我姓庞
幸会啊，庞
我说庞，这城里怎么了？
为什么大家都害怕谈论战争？
战争？害怕？你啥意思？
你好像在发抖啊
我只是个政府的小官员
熬了三年才盘了这幢房子
我可不想惹麻烦
谁会找你麻烦？
听着，你们不能在这儿提战争二字
无论你们要做什么，都要离“戴笠”远点
咱们泡壶茶喝呀？
都在茶馆都工作一天了
我现在见茶就想吐
怎么会，喝茶就跟呼吸一样是必需的
看到火石了吗，我要烧壶水
它们在我这儿
老头，用你的御火术吧
你要去哪儿？
我从邻居那儿借来了，真是好人啊
有了！我知道怎样才能见到土强王了
别做梦了，人家都说了
“没有谁可以冒然拜见土强王的”
国王今晚将会在宫中
为他的宠物熊举办一个派对
是鸭嘴兽熊吗？
这上面没说
他的宠物肯定是臭鼬熊
没准是穿山甲熊
那是地鼠熊？
只是熊而已
这地方真怪
到时皇宫里肯定挤满了人
我们可以偷偷的溜进去
没用的
为啥？
无意冒犯，不过就你这乡下人举止
在那些达官贵族中
肯定一眼就能被看出来了
你们一点都不懂礼仪
啥？我们不懂礼仪，也不知道谁成天邋里邋遢的
我可是受过正规的社交礼仪培训
我只是懒得用
你们都没有学过，现在想学也太晚了
啊哈，但是你学过啊，你可以教我们
没错，四种元素我都掌握了
学个礼仪能有多难？
晚上好啊，水族的索卡先生
水族的卡塔拉女士
还有您来自模模王朝的模模王
模模陛下，晚上好
安昂神通，一向可好啊？
卡塔拉勉强可以充数
你俩装个侍者的话没准能混进去
我自己感觉挺好的啊
-土
-火
哇哦，你看起来真美
社交的第一准则，不要与平民交谈
我们会混进派对的，到时再伺机开侧门放你们进去
杰，咱们得谈谈
谁？哦，太好了，是你们
你们去哪了？我需要你们帮我盯梢
我俩已经讨论过了
你对此事太过专注了
这样对你不好
哦，是吗？你们都这么想吗？
我们来这儿是为了重新开始生活的
可你却抱着过去不放
即便你是对的，也没有真凭实据呀
那就帮我找出证据来
杰，你还是放手吧
难道你们忘了为何要重新开始生活？
是火宗人让我们流离失所
是他们夺走了我们挚爱的人
如果你们不帮我，我就自己去找证据
这是全城最好的茶了
秘方其实就是爱心
回头给你涨工资
我可是等腻了，这两个人是御火师
我知道他们是火宗人
我看到这老头弄热了一杯茶
茶馆的店小二不就是干这个的嘛
我跟你说，他是御火师
孩子，把剑放下来，慢慢的别紧张
快还手啊，让大家看看
来啊，亮一招瞧瞧
你想比试吗？那就如你所愿
请出示请柬
这个应该可以吧
没有请柬不许入内
请你们站到一边
看，庞家和余松汉家的人正在里面等着我们
你最好不要惹他们生气，快让我们进去
请你们站到一边
先生，很抱歉打搅您，我和表妹把请柬丢了
她还是个盲人
你能帮帮我们吗？
我们的家人已经进去了，他们现在一定很担心
我很荣幸
跟我来吧
它把好吃的都造了
安静点，好不容易才搞到挨着熊的位置
很美，不是吗？
对了，敝人是长风，皇家的文化部长
我是画眉，这是“芬”
（Dung：粪）
你们的家人在哪？我想认识认识他们
嗯，我还没看到他们
肯定一会就能找到，多谢你的帮忙
别担心，我好人做到底
在找到你们的家人之前
我是不会离开你们的
咱们接着找吧
她们在哪？
我看，用我的B计划怎么样？
不如让模模装鬼吧？
等它分散了警卫的注意力，我们就可以趁机溜进去
或者就跟着他们进去吧
拓芙说，我们装侍者没准能混进去
好吧，不过别忘了模模鬼计划，那招肯定管用
你用剑应该用累了吧
你干嘛不赶快用御火术对付我？
孩子，别傻了，你这是在干什么？
打赌你现在肯定想发个火球解决我吧
你才是需要帮助的人
看见没？火宗人想灭我的口
不会让你得逞的
拓芙和卡塔拉哪儿去了
别管她们了，先找土强王吧
我都不知道他长啥样
就是挺“贵族”的，穿着长袍，戴昂贵的珠宝
这儿的人都那样
再来个螃蟹泡芙
你找到我们了
你的脚步声可逃不过我的耳朵，亮脚趾
能进来还真多亏了你们啊
抱歉，那个护送我们进来的人，一直跟着我们不走
哪个人？
你们在这儿干嘛？
你们得赶紧离开，不然我们都会有大麻烦的
不见到土强王我们是不会走的
你们不了解，你们必须走
抱歉，不，别喊
是降世神通，哦，不知道您会大驾光临
接着吸引他们的注意力，我去找皇上
大家看好了
把武器放下
抓住他们，他们是火宗人
这孩子一定是认错人了，我们只不过是流浪汉罢了
这个年轻人闯进我的茶馆
攻击我的雇员
没错，长官，我目睹了全经过
这个疯小孩居然攻击全城最好的茶道师
哦，哦，您缪赞了
跟我们走一趟吧
你们不明白，他们是火宗人
你们得相信我
安昂，土强王来了
陛下，幸会啊
嘿，放开我
神通，能见到你是我的荣幸
我叫长风，永固城的中宪大夫，“戴笠”的总领
请借一步说话
你的朋友都在尚书房侯着呢
为什么不让我们见土强王？
我们带来了可以战败烈火国的情报
土强国没那种闲功夫浪费在政治争斗...
和军事打击之类的琐事上
这消息可是非同小可啊
土强王的皇权是要靠永固城文化的传承来维系的
颁布法令条例才是他的责任
而监督协调城中其他资源则是
我的工作，当然军队也是我说的算
这么说土强王只是个傀儡？
他只是你手中的玩偶
哦，不，不！陛下
可是人们顶礼膜拜的领袖
怎能用无尽的战争中来让他分心
但是我们发现在日食日火宗人将无抵抗之力
我们应该发起一个入侵...
够了，不想再听你们的胡言乱语
永固城法律明确规定
不许在城内提战争二字
散布关于战争内容的消息
只会使永固城居民惶惶不可终日
你们得相信我，他们是火宗人
他们不赢得战争是不会善罢甘休的
冷静点，你现在安全了
我们的经济将被破坏
我们的和平生活，我们的传统都将会消失
永固城内没有战争
你这是什么话？照你这么说
那些难民又是从哪来的？事实是掩盖不住的
永不谈论暴力，永固城就会永保和平、且秩序井然
它将是世上最后一片乐土
城中没有战争，在这我们是安全的
我们是自由的
纸是包不住火的，他们总有一天会知道的
我会告诉他们，我会让他们都知道
直到现在，我仍待你们为上宾
但是从今以后，戴笠特工队将会时刻监视你们
如果你们敢乱来，定会将你们驱逐出城
你不是一直在找你的野牛吗？
若是找不到它，你一定会很遗憾的
朱迪将会送你们回家
请跟我来吧
朱蒂哪去了？
我是朱迪，我将会带您们游览这座奇迹之城

真不敢想象，我们居然能活着来到永固城
我只是想让咱们住的地方好看点
没准某人哪天就会带女友回家来的
我可不想在这儿开枝散叶

大概一个月后就能安排你们觐见
如果我们要在这儿耗上一个月的话
应该花点时间去寻找阿柏了
