Act I

The Tale of Toph and Katara

Written by: Joann Estoesta and Lisa Wahlander

(The title slide for the tale fades into an exterior shot of the gang’s
house in Ba-Sing-Se. It then cuts to a shot of Aang’s head in a mirror
covered with shaving cream as he shaves it off with a razor blade. Shot
pans left to Sokka’s head in the mirror to show he has a few hairs growing
above his lip which he cuts off with the end of his machete. He then
clicks his tongue and points at his reflection. Camera pans left again to
show Katara in the mirror as she fixes together her hair loops. Once they
are placed, she smiles and the camera cuts back to show the whole room,
with them all staring at the mirror, and Momo off to the side on a stool
giving himself to bath like a cat. Shot cuts to a dark room where, Toph,
her hair a horrible mess, lays face-down on her bed, her blanket sloppily
laying over her. A sliver of light cuts through the darkness as the door
opens. Katara enters the room and gasps at the sight.)

Katara: Huh! Toph, aren’t you gonna to get ready for the day‌

(Toph whips her head up causing her wild bed-head-hair to fly about. She
quickly spits a large loogy into a nearby spittoon which spins upon
impact. Cut to Katara’s face as she looks shocked, then cut back to Toph
as she gets to her feet and brushes a large amount of dust off her
sleeping shirt.)

Toph: I’m ready.
Katara: You’re not gonna wash up‌ You’ve got a little dirt on
your…everywhere actually.
Toph: You call it dirt. I call it a healthy coating of earth.
Katara: Hmmm. You know what we need‌ A girl’s day out!
Toph: Do I have to‌
Katara: It’ll be fun.

(Cut to outside of a large building that is decorated with pictures of
flowers and plants, Toph and Katara stand near the entrance. Fancily
dressed woman in beautiful robes walk out and smile at each other.)

Toph: The Fancy Lady Day Spa‌ Sounds like my kinda place.
Katara: Are you ready for some serious pampering‌
Toph: Sure Katara, whatever you say. As long as they don’t touch my feet.

(The walk in, Toph with her head hung low. Cut to an interior shot where
Katara sits happily having her feet scrubbed. Shot cuts again to a
close-up of Toph’s foot as the attendants, who have to hold the girl down,
are hard at work trying to scrape the massive amounts of dirt off her
feet. A close up of Toph’s angry face show she isn’t pleased with this.)

Toph: Arrrr! Rrrrr! Errrr!

(Cut to a shot of an empty hallway within the spa as suddenly an explosion
of dust erupts from one of the doorways as the frame is crumpled and an
attendant flies out and hits the opposite wall, Toph having just performed
some earthbending apparently out of annoyance. The shot cuts to Toph and
Katara each taking mud baths, with mud covering their faces in a mask,
cucumber slices over their eyes, and their heads rapped in towels. An
attendant with arms full of fresh towels walks over to Toph. Cut to Toph’s
face as she breaths in then exhales which it apparently some form of
earthbending as the mud on her face begins to move strangely and creating
a scary appearance. The attendant, having seen this, screams and runs off.
Katara and Toph laugh, as the mud around Toph’s mouth forms a large goofy
smile.)

Toph and Katara: Hahaha!

(Shot fades into a pile of rocks in the sauna that Toph and Katara now
occupy. Toph kicks the ground once causing a rock from the cold pile to
fly onto the pile of hot rocks. Katara, using waterbending, slashes the
hot rocks with some water creating steam. They both sigh.

Fade into Toph walking down the streets of Ba-Sing-Se with the front of
her hair, which usually hangs to cover her forehead, now combed back
behind her ears and her face now with lots of make-up.)

Toph: Well, that wasn’t so bad. I’m not usually into that stuff, but I
actually feel…girly.
Katara: (Cut back to show them both walking together, Katara’s face has
make-up as well.) I’m glad, it’s about time we did something fun together.

(Cut to a shot of the two crossing a stone bridge over a creek. As they
do, they pass three girls going the other direction. They wear fancy
dresses and robes, one sporting a fashionable umbrella.)

1st Mean Girl: Wow, great makeup.
Toph: Thanks.
1st Mean Girl: For a clown!

(Toph’s face drops into a frown as the stop walking.)

Katara: Don’t listen to them, let’s just keep walking.
Star: I think she looks cute. Like that time we put that sweater on your
pet poodle monkey.
3rd Mean Girl: Good one, Star!
Katara: Let’s go Toph.
Toph: No, no. That was a good one! “Like your poodle-monkey”… Ha ha! You
know what else is a good one‌

(Toph pounds the ground once causing dust to rumble up as her earthbending
shoots across the bridge to where the girls stand. A hole opens up in the
stone bridge where Toph’s earthbending reaches them and all three fall
through into the creek.)

Girls: Ahhh!
Katara: Now that was funny.

(With one move of her arm, Katara waterbends a huge wave that sweeps the
girls away and down stream as they scream. Cut to a shot of Toph walking
away from the bridge as Katara jogs to catch up.)

Katara: Those girls don’t know what they’re talking about.
Toph: It’s ok. One of the good things about being blind is I don’t have to
waste my time worrying about appearances. (Cut to her frowning face.) I
don’t care what I look like. I’m not looking for anyone’s approval. I know
who I am. (They stop walking, shot cuts back to show the both of them.)
Katara: That’s what I really admire about you, Toph. You’re so strong and
confidant and self assured. And I know it doesn’t matter, but…you’re
really pretty.
Toph: (Smiling) I am‌
Katara: Yeah. You are.

(Shot cuts to show them walking away together from behind.)

Toph: I’d return the compliment, but I have no idea what you look like.
Katara: (Laughs)
Toph: Thank you, Katara. (She punches her in the shoulder in a friendly
way.)
Katara: Ow!

Act II

The Tale of Iroh

Written by: Andrew Huebner

(Title card for this tale fades into a shot of a marketplace in Ba-Sing-Se
from overhead. Cut to a shot of the street that shows Iroh walking
pleasantly down the lane and stopping to examine a basket being sold by a
merchant.)

Merchant: If this is for a romantic picnic, may I suggest this lavender
one‌
Iroh: No, it is not a romantic picnic, but it is a special occasion. (He
hands the merchant a few coins and picks up the basket. Iroh turns to
leave the market stall when a closed flower in a vase catches his eye. He
slides the vase out of the sunlight and into the shade) The moonflower
likes partial shade.

(Iroh bows to the merchant and walks away. Shot fades into Iroh examining
another merchant’s stall which sells liuqins, which are a type of Asian
lute which is a stringed instrument. The sound of a crying child catches
Iroh’s attention and he turns around to see a boy sobbing the middle of
the street and his mother trying to console him.)

Child: (crying) Wahh!
Woman: Shhh. It’s ok. Shhh.

(The sound of music being played on one of the liuqins is herd as Iroh
approaches, singing a tune with a smile on his face. He gets down on one
knee next to the boy as he sings.)

Iroh: (singing)
Leaves from the vine, falling so slow.
Like fragile, tiny shells,
Drifting in the foam.
Little soldier boy, come marching home.
Brave soldier boy, comes marching home.

(The boy’s frown instantly turns to a smile as he reaches up and pulls
Iroh’s long beard.)

Iroh: Yeowch!
Child: Hahaha!

(Iroh smiles and pets his beard. The boy’s mother takes her son by the
hand and leads him away as Iroh stand and looks after them with a very
pleasant look on his face. Scene fades to a courtyard as Iroh enters to
pass through. Four boys are in the courtyard with a white ball playing a
game. One of the boys hits the ground with his foot and the ball shoots up
and back down. He kicks it and then follows up with some earthbending. A
patch of earth rises to create a path for the ball as it rolls along.
Another player earthbends to impede the path of the ball before it reaches
the goal. This causes the ball to launch up and into the direction Iroh is
standing. He moves out of the way just in time, but the ball rips through
the window directly behind where he was. A crash and a loud voice can be
herd from inside.)

Angry Man: Hey!

(Iroh walks over to the boys as they gather around him to listen to what
he has to say.)

Iroh: It is usually best to admit mistakes when they occur, and to seek to
restore honor-

(Loud smashes are herd and all five of them look up, startled. Shot cuts
to show the window as a very large body and head are visible through the
hole.)

Angry Man: When I am through with you kids, the window won’t be the only
thing that’s broken!

(Cut back to Iroh and the boys.)

Iroh: -but not this time. Run!

(The boys and Iroh all run in different directions. Shot changes to show
Iroh running down the marketplace street quickly. He hides in an alley,
places the basket down, and the shot changes to shot him looking around
the corner to see if he’s being chased.)

Mugger: You. Give me all your money!

(Shot changes to show a messy looking man with a dagger pointed directly
at Iroh standing behind him, but the shot pans down to show his legs bent
at a very odd angle as he stands.)

Iroh: What are you doing‌
Mugger: I’m mugging you!
Iroh: With that stance‌
Mugger: Wha -‌ What are you talking about‌ Just give me your money, old
man!
Iroh: With a poor stance you are unbalanced, and you can be easily knocked
over.

(In one swift move, Iroh grabs the arm of the mugger and disarms him,
while simultaneously proving his point by pushing his attacker and
knocking him to the ground).

Mugger: Ugh!

(Iroh twirls the dagger in his hand then helps the man to his feet.)

Iroh: With a solid stance, you are a much more serious threat. (Iroh
demonstrates a proper stance for the mugger. The mugger attempts to
imitate Iroh’s stance, but is still not assuming the correct form. Iroh
walks over to him and holds his attacker’s head still while he adjusts the
man’s stance by nudging his backside forward with his foot. After helping
him assume the correct form, Iroh is now pleased with the man’s stance. )
Much better! But to tell you the truth, you do not look like the criminal
type.

Mugger: I know. I’m…I’m just confused.

(The next shot shows a close up of the mugger’s hands holding a cup, while
off screen Iroh pours hot, steamy tea for the man.)

Mugger: So you really think I could be a good masseur‌

(Shot cuts back to show the two still in the alley, sitting on the ground
sharing some tea and talking.)

Iroh: Of course!
Mugger: This is so great! No one has ever believed in me.
Iroh: While it is always best to believe in one&#x27;s self, a little help from
others can be a great blessing.

(The scene fades into the next which is a shot of a tree on a hill within
the city as the sun is setting; very similar to the tree from Iroh’s
flashback in Bitter Work. Leaves gently fall from the tree as Iroh
approaches the trunk and looks out over the city as a softer version of
Iroh’s liuqin music from earlier plays in the background. Iroh places the
basket down and removes his hat. He then rests on his knees and piles some
rocks at the tree’s base. Searching though her basket, he removes several
things and places them at the bottom of the tree. He pulls out a sheet of
paper and looks at it for a few seconds, closing his eyes and bowing his
head, before placing it down as well. Finally he pulls two joss sticks,
which are sticks of incense that burn, and lights them with his fingers by
clicking the tips and places them down as well. The shot then shows that
Iroh has just made a small memorial for his passed son, Lu Ten. The
memorial is little more then the burning joss sticks, a few apples, and a
bag of unknown contents. Most importantly, a sketched picture of Lu Ten
sits against the rocks. He was quite handsome and had the same hair
features that his father once did.)

Iroh: Happy Birthday my son. (Cut to his face as he begins to cry.) If
only I could have helped you. (He begins to sing his song from earlier,
only this time he has difficulty keeping his voice from cracking under his
grief.)

Leaves from the vine, falling so slow.
Like fragile, tiny shells,
Drifting in the foam.
Little soldier boy, come marching home.
Brave soldier boy, comes marching home.

(The tale ends with a freeze frame of Iroh under the tree sitting atop the
hill. The images in the scene blur into a beautiful ethereal impression of
color and form. This all happens in time with the music. Then a message
appears during the final notes of the song. The message pays homage to the
life of the talented actor who voiced Uncle Iroh.)

“In Honor Of Mako”

Act III

The Tale of Aang

Written by: Gary Scheppke

(This tale’s title card fades into an aerial shot of the city as Aang
soars down over it on his glider. The shot cuts to a mostly deserted
street, save for one man walking alone, as Aang lands on it, twirling his
glider back into a staff. Shot cuts to Aang walking down the street, which
is lined on both sides with various cages and pens built into the rock.
Aang passes each pen and looks in to see different creatures looking sad
and depressed, his expression matching theirs. He stops and looks up into
a cage where a group of dragon flies, which look like very small dragons
with small wings like an insect’s. Shot cuts to him looking down into
another pen which is a pit to see another baboon-like creature lying on
the ground, apparently very bored. Shot cuts to an armadillo lion gnawing
at the bars that keep him in. It looks up as Aang approaches.)

Aang: (Kneeling down and holding his hand out.) Hey there, fella. You look
hungry. (The creature roars loudly causing Aang to jump back in surprise.)
Ahh!

(The armadillo lion curls up into a ball and rolls away in its pen as the
zookeeper walks behind Aang, sweeping.)

Zookeeper: Hm! They are hungry. (Shot cuts to the zookeeper and Aang
walking together through the zoo) The Dai Li won’t give me any money
because the kids stopped coming. And the kids won’t come because my zoo’s
nasty and broke.
Aang: (Looking into a cage) What kind of animal is that‌
Zookeeper: Oh, that’s rabbiroo. I wish I could get her a big open prairie
like she likes. (Cut to show the depressed creature) I’d let her hop her
way to happiness.
Aang: (Smiling) Let’s do it!
Zookeeper: Say again‌
Aang: There’s a big open space right outside the walls of the city.
Zookeeper: But how are you gonna transport all these wild critters‌
Aang: (Grinning) Don’t worry. I’m great with animals.

(With a loud crash, the shot cuts to a group of monkey-like creatures
wreaking havoc in one of the shops in the city, throwing pottery and
breaking things. The owner comes in swinging a broom in an attempt to save
his shop and manages to send one of them flying, Shot cuts to the
creatures fleeing the shop and into the street just as an elephant
mandrill comes stampeding down it while people run for their lives. In the
background another group of people come running out of an ally covering
their heads to escape the dragon flies that fly over them. A platypus bear
enters the street and stands on its legs, swinging and growling as more
people scream and run away. It pursues a group down an ally and the
armadillo lion comes rolling in and runs off in another direction. Cut to
a shot of the rabbiroo devouring cabbages from a pile. The shot cuts back
to show that the creature is assaulting none other than the Cabbage
Merchant’s cart who is desperately trying to save his beloved cabbages.)

Cabbage Merchant: My cab- (The rabbiroo looks up at him with a cabbage in
its mouth. It chews it a bit and returns to the cart.) -oh, forget it!

(Shot cuts to several people in the street covering their heads as dragon
flies hover over them. Aang descends into the street and uses his staff to
shoo the creatures away with airbending. He uses a large blast of air to
knock all of them out of the street.)

Aang: (Scratching his head) This was so much easier in my head!

(Getting an idea, Aang snaps his finger and reaches into his shirt to pull
out his bison whistle. He flips the whistle into the air and, using
airbending, inhales a great amount of air. Then, catching the whistle, he
blows into it with huge force. The whistle squeals louder and higher than
usual, as the shot pull back to show a shockwave of sorts emitting from
where Aang is and through the city as the whistle’s sound spreads. Shot
cuts to the monkey-like creatures from earlier, one with a pot over its
head still, which hear the sound and run off. The dragon flies, who
apparently found new people to terrorize, hear it and abandon their
targets to investigate. The rabbiroo, still devouring cabbages as the
Cabbage Merchant sobs in the background, leaves the cart as she hears the
whistle as well.

Shot cuts to Aang riding his air scooter down a street blowing the bison
whistle. Cut to an ally where we see Aang fly by on the main street, a
large stampede of creatures follow him, with a very slow turtle seal
bringing up the rear. Shot cuts to the zookeeper talking with two guards
at the wall.)

Zookeeper: But you have to open this gate!
Guard 1: Or what‌
Zookeeper: (Pointing behind himself) Or that!

(Cut to Aang quickly approaching on his air scooter, still blowing the
whistle, with a huge number of animals chasing him.)

Guard 2: (Cut back to him standing by the wall) Open the gate!

(Shot pulls back to show the massive wall of Ba-Sing-Se opening to allow
Aang through. As Aang reaches the opening, he stops blowing the whistle
and jumps off his scooter and onto his glider. The creatures plow through
the opening as he soars up and over the wall. On the other side, the
creatures are shown coming out of the opening and starting to spread out
as the run in all directions. Cut to shot that shows Aang soar down behind
the running animals and onto his air scooter again. As he rides, he
punches the ground causing a large wall of earth to rise as he rides in a
large circle creating a pen to block the fleeing animals. Once he
finishes, he jumps off his scooter and lands in the center of the pen he
just made. He earthbends again, causing a square portion of the ground to
descend and create a small pit. He turns around and brings his arms up
high to cause a large pillar of earth to rise, then turns and punches
outward which, when the shot pulls back, shows him making more walls to
separate the animals.

Shot cuts to show, apparently after Aang had finished, a large area of
rock walls and pens all situated like a zoo made from Aang’s earthbending.
Shot cuts to show the guards and the zookeeper entering, all looking
amazed at what Aang just did. A group of kids, all laughing and smiling,
push past them and run in. Shot cuts to show the entirety of Aang’s new
zoo as people move around the newly formed pens and examine the animals.
Shot cuts to show the rabbiroo drinking from a pond then looking up at one
of the guests as three infant rabbiroo poke up from its pouch. Cut to Aang
speaking with the zookeeper beside one of the pens.)

Aang: Well, Mr. Zookeeper, how do you like your new facilities‌
Zookeeper: Excellent job, Avatar. You should think about working with
animals for a living.

(Aang looks behind him as a guest’s voice catches his ear.)

Child visitor: (Pointing into one of the pens) Mommy, Ms. Snowflake got
out of the house again.
Adult Visitor: (Shot shows a hissing cat in of the pens) Fluffykins‌ (Cut
to the guest’s face) What are you doing down there‌

(Shot cuts to show the cat hissing at the elephant mandrill it’s sharing a
pen with.)

Zookeeper: On second thought, (Cut to him and Aang) you should probably
stick to saving people.
Aang: (Laughs nervously)

Act IV

The Tale of Sokka

Written by: Lauren Macmullan

(Tale fades into Sokka walking down a candle-lit street at night. He
reaches back and pulls his boomerang from its sheath, throws it into the
sky, and catches it as it comes back. Shot cuts to him walking past a
building and into the ally beside it. In the ally, a man struggles with
his ostrich horse. Sokka passes them, and by the windows of the building,
as he hears voices from inside. Intrigued, he turns and sticks his head
inside the window.)

Sokka: What’s this‌

(The shot from Sokka’s perspective shows the rooms to be a classroom of
sorts with a stage. The girls that occupy the class all wear beautiful
dresses and head pieces. There is a student on stage reading her writings
to the class.)

Student on stage: Through all the long night, winter moon glows with
bright love, sleet her silver tears.
Sokka: (His head resting on his hands, looking pleased) Ahh, poetry.

(Shot cuts to the ally again, as the ostrich horse, who is still
struggling with his handler, kicks backward and hits Sokka right his the
behind sending him flying through the window and into the class.)

Students: (startled) Oooh!

(The girls all gasp in shock as Sokka hangs from the window, part of the
frame around his chest. He starts to apologize and he pulls himself into
the room and falls onto the stage.)

Sokka: I am so sorry. Something struck me in the rear. I just… wound up…
here‌
Students: (Laughing and clapping)

(Sokka grins as he stands in front of the class. The woman on the far
right of the group of girls stands up, applauding softly but looking
stern.)

Madame Macmu-Ling: (Applauds Sokka) Five seven then five, syllables mark a
Haiku, (Bowing her head to him) remarkable oaf.
Sokka: (Looking annoyed, then ponders this for a second.) They call me
Sokka, that is in the water tribe, (Counting the next five syllables on
his fingers as he says them) I am not an oaf.

(The girls laugh but Macmu-Ling still looks stern and does not applaud
this time.)

Madame Macmu-Ling: Chittering monkey, in the spring he climbs treetops,
and thinks himself tall.
Students: Ooooh.
Sokka: You think you’re so smart, with your fancy little words, this is
not so hard.
Students: Ooooh!
Madame Macmu-Ling: (Walking up to Sokka on stage) Whole seasons are spent
mastering the form, they style, none calls it easy!
Sokka: I calls it easy! Like I paddle my canoe, (Turns around and paddles
his behind once) I’ll paddle yours too!
Students: (Laughing)
Madame Macmu-Ling: There’s nuts and there’s fruits, (Pulls a plumb from
her sleeve and drops it to the ground) in fall the clinging plumb drops,
always to be squashed.

(She steps on the plumb, squashing it.)

Sokka: (Making different arm motions) Squish-squash, sling that slang. I’m
always right back at ya, like my… (Drawing and presenting his boomerang to
her face) boomerang!
Students: (Laughing)

(Macmu-Ling looks annoyed but walks off stage and back to her seat as
Sokka turns to the class again and raises his arms up to silence the
laughter.)

Sokka: (Sheathing his boomerang and making more arm movements) That’s
right I’m Sokka, it’s pronounced with an “okka”, young ladies, I rocked
ya!

(This time his words are met with total silence as he stares over the
class who look annoyed at him. Cut to his face as he begins to count his
fingers, attempting to figure out of he had too many syllables. Sure
enough, he realizes his final line contained six syllables instead of
five. A large man approaches him and grabs him up by the collar.)

Security: Uh, that’s one too many syllables there, bub.

(Picking Sokka completely up, he throws him head first across the room and
out the door. Outside, he hits the ground with a thud and sits up holding
his head.)

Sokka: …poetry.

Act V

The Tale of Zuko

Written by: Andrew Huebner

(The tale fades into an exterior shot of Pao’s teashop, the place where
Zuko and Iroh both work under the guise of Lee and Mushi respectively. Cut
to a shot of the inside where Zuko walks down the shop with a trey of cups
and looking over his shoulder once at something off-screen. He walks up
behind his uncle who is on a ladder, stacking things on a shelf behind the
counter.)

Zuko: Uncle, we have a problem. (Iroh descends the ladder,) One of the
customers is on to us. Don’t look now, (Cut to a shot of a very attractive
girl sitting in the corner of the shop sipping tea.) but there is a girl
over there at the corner table. She knows we’re fire nation. (Cut back to
the pair, Zuko forces Iroh to turn around as he had turned to look. Iroh
sports a grin on his face.) Didn’t I say don’t look!
Iroh: (From off-screen as the shot cuts back to show the girl.) You’re
right Zuko. I’ve seen that girl in here quite a lot. (Cut back to them.)
Seems to me she has quite a little crush on you.
Zuko: (Reeling back in surprise) What‌!
Jin: (From behind both of them suddenly, causing them to part to show
her.) Thank you for the tea. (She hands Zuko a few coins who takes them
and turns away from her.) What’s your name‌

Zuko: (Turning back to her) My name’s Lee. My Uncle and I just moved here.

Jin: Hi Lee, my name is Jin. Thank you and, well, I was wondering if you
would like to go out sometime‌
Iroh: (Before the stunned Zuko can respond) He’d love to!
Jin: Great! I will meet you in front of the shop at sundown.

(Jin walks away, leaving Zuko standing bewildered as his uncle throws an
arm around his shoulders with a large, goofy grin on his face again.

Fade into an exterior shot of the shop again, only at nighttime now. The
door opens as Zuko steps out into the street. He is wearing a very
handsome green outfit, a contrast to his typical brown every-day clothing.
Though the most startling and humorous change in his appearance is that
his hair, which is usually shaggy and unkempt, has been combed and parted.
He walks out into the middle of the street and looks around as Jin emerges
from around the side of the shop and approaches him.)

Jin: Hey. Well, look at you. (She reaches up and messes his hair so it
looks normal again.) You look so cute!
Zuko: It took my Uncle ten minutes to do my hair.

(Jin grabs Zuko by the arm and leads him off as he glances once back at
the teashop. Cut to what appears to be town square of sorts where several
people stand around doing various activities. The shot centers on the
exterior of a patio restaurant. Cut to the Zuko and Jin who are eating at
this place, Jin sipping on tea while Zuko pokes at his last meatball with
his chop sticks, not looking at his date.)

Jin: So, how do you like the city so far‌
Zuko: It’s ok.
Jin: What do you like to do for fun‌
Zuko: Nothing.
Waiter: (Walking over to address Zuko) Excuse me sir. Would you and your
girlfriend care for dessert‌
Zuko: (Shouting and pounding the table with his fist) She is not my
girlfriend!

(The restaurant goes quiet as everyone glances over at him. The waiter
walks away and Zuko laces his fingers and looks around at Jin who seems to
have not taken any kind of offense or, indeed, any form of notice to this
outburst and is devouring noodles from a bowl at an alarming rate. Zuko
blinds once before speaking again to her.)

Zuko: (Trying to find something to say) You have… quite an appetite for a
girl.
Jin: Um, thanks‌ So, Lee, where were you and your Uncle living before you
came here‌
Zuko: Um, well, we’ve been traveling around for a long time.
Jin: Oh! Why were you traveling so much‌
Zuko: We were uh, apart of this traveling circus.
Jin: Really‌ What did you do‌ Wait, lemme guess, you juggled!

(Zuko, arms folded, pauses for a moment before responding.)

Zuko: Yes. I juggled.
Jin: I’ve always wanted to learn how to juggle. Can you show me something‌

(Jin holds out an assortment of objects apparently from the table that
Zuko takes in his arms. He then throws each one up in the air, one after
the other, and then prepares to catch them. He succeeds in catching none
of them and one manages to fall onto his head and break into many pieces.
Jin doesn’t laugh, but smiles gently.)

Zuko: Whoah! I haven’t practiced for awhile. (He wipes the shards of
pottery from his hair.)
Jin: It’s alright. Hey, I want to show you one of my favorite places in
the city.

(Scene fades into a street somewhere in the city that is lit only by the
light of the full moon and is deserted save for Zuko and Jin, the ladder
leading the former by the hand.)

Jin: I’m so excited for you to see the firelight fountain. The lamps make
the water sparkle and reflect in the pool in the most beautiful way.

(She leads Zuko into an open area with a large fountain and several posts
with candles on top surrounding it in a circle; however, to spite its
apparent name, it is dark and the candles unlit.)

Jin: I can’t believe it! They arn’t lit.

(Zuko looks at the disappointed Jin’s face for a moment, then at the
candles.)

Zuko: Close your eyes and don’t peak.

(Zuko walks out into the circle of candles, holds his hands together, and
closes his eyes as he prepares. A close-up of Zuko’s face shows his eyes
open and another shot shows him begin to firebend. Using his pointer and
middle fingers on each hand, he shoots small bursts of flame in all
directions at the candles to light them. Once finished, he stands straight
and looks at Jin, still with her eyes closed.)

Zuko: Ok. Now you can look.
Jin: Oh wow… (Shot shows the whole area lit by the candles. Jin walks to
Zuko looking around in amazement.) What happened‌ How did they light‌ What
did you… (Zuko simply smiles at her.)

(They both turn to look at the fountain. As Zuko examines his work, Jin
brushes her hand through her hair and smiles at him, though he doesn’t
see. She reaches over and grabs his hand to hold it. Having attracted his
attention, Zuko turns to look at the girl smiling at him. They both turn
to be face to face and as Jin begins to lean in for a kiss, Zuko quickly
draws a piece of paper which he holds between their lips.)

Zuko: I brought you something. It’s a coupon for a free cup of tea.
Jin: (Taking the coupon) Lee, this is so sweet.
Zuko: (He takes a few steps away from her.) Don’t thank me. It was my
Uncle’s idea. He thinks you’re our most valuable customer.
Jin: Your Uncle is a good teacher. I have something for you too. (She
walks back to him and places her hand on his cheek.) Now it’s your turn to
close your eyes.

(He does so and Jin makes her move. The shot shows both of their lips as
Jin delivers a short kiss and pulls back slightly. Zuko’s lips move to
hers to return the kiss and he begins to but the shot cuts to show him
jumping back away from her. He stands for a second, looking at her, then
turns his back and begins to walk away.)

Jin: What’s wrong‌
Zuko: It’s complicated. I have to go.

(Zuko runs from the fountain leaving a confused Jin standing alone. The
scene then cuts to Iroh who is leaning out of the window of his and his
nephew’s apartment, looking up and down the street apparently waiting on
Zuko’s return. Behind him, the door opens as Zuko enters without saying
anything.)

Iroh: How was your night Prince Zuko‌

(Zuko walks across the floor and into what must be his room and slams the
doors behind him without a word. Iroh looks after him for a second with a
confused look on his face before turning back to the window to trim the
flowerbed sitting there. Though, when the sound of the doors opening again
is herd, he turns back around. Shot cuts to show Zuko’s face in the crack
between the two doors.)

Zuko: It was nice.

(He closes the door again as Iroh smiles pleasantly and returns to his
flowers.)

Act VI

The Tale of Momo

Written by: Justin Ridge and Giancarlo Volpe

(This dialog-free tale opens with a shot of a tree, similar to the giant
one seen in The Swamp, towering high above the clouds. Suddenly, Appa
flies up through the clouds and over to the tree. A new shot shows many
fruits hanging from what appear to be vines on the tree. Appa hovers
underneath these and Momo is seen perched upon the buffalo’s head. Momo
flies up and begins eating some fruit and tosses some down to Appa who
chews them passively. As Momo continues to chew on one of the fruits, Appa
suddenly gives a very great roar.

The screen flashes white and the shot cuts to Momo asleep on the
windowsill of the Avatar’s house. Startled by the thunder that woke him
from his dream, Momo leaps up into Sokka’s green Earth Kingdom bag that is
hanging nearby. After a bit, he pokes his head up and realizes he has a
bunch of white fur lying on his head that does not belong to him. After
sniffing it a bit, the screen flashes white into a shot of Appa and Momo
flying to indicate this is what Momo is thinking of at that second. With
another roar of Appa’s, the screen flashes white again and back to the
real world as Momo chatters as he registers whom the fur belongs to.

The camera then pulls back to a shot from the lawn of the Avatar’s house
with Momo visible through the window. A shadow crosses the ground that
looks very similar to Appa’s shadow. Cut back to Momo as he wraps the wad
of fur around one of his front legs and takes flight. He soars out the
window of the house and into the yard to investigate if this shadow does
indeed belong to his lost friend. But, alas, as he emerges from a tree he
flew up into, he realizes that the shadow is merely being cast by a cloud.
He holds his arm up and looks at the fur tied to it sadly, but then
chatters a bit as he notices something new. Off in the distance, just on
the other side of a roof, is what appears to be the top of the flying
bison he is looking for. But when Momo flies closer, he finds out it was
only a tree with white leaves and branches sticking out that looked
similar to Appa’s horns. Momo lands on one of these branches and his ears
drop low in disappointment that he has once again failed to find his
friend.

Fade into a shot of a street in the city as Momo soars down into it. He
lands on a water barrel that has no lid and begins to drink from it. As he
does, his wagging tail accidentally knocks over a stick sitting nearby. It
falls to the ground with a loud thud that alerts three pygmy panthers who
were rummaging in the garbage nearby. The panthers growl at Momo and
suddenly pounce on him. Momo manages to dodge this in time and run into a
box with an opening big enough for him but not enough for the panthers.
The three predators surround the box and growl, two of them clawing in the
openings to try and catch the lemur. Momo manages to slip out of an open
crack in the back of the box and soar away. The panthers, however, are in
hot pursuit. Chasing him by running on rooftops, one of them manages to
swat him clean out of the air. After hitting the ground, Momo gets to his
feet and runs on foot into a ground of people. The panthers do not follow
their pray into the crowd.

Momo is then picked up by a man within this crowd and has a green little
hat stringed to his head. He’s tossed into an opening in the circle of the
people where two monkeys are already dancing to the beat of a drummer in
the background. After standing for a moment, Momo dances along too in a
very strange and silly dance as a faster, livelier version of his theme
music plays. The crowd all cheer and clap for the dance, but the panthers
are stalking just outside the perimeter of people, looking in between the
legs at their prey. One of the monkeys jumps onto Momo’s head and balances
with its hand, the other then doing the same on his head, and Momo
struggles to keep balance.

The panthers growl and finally make their move, all of them leaping into
the circle with a roar. Momo flees again, but this time as he tries to fly
away, one of them grabs him round the middle and is taken for the ride,
which slows him down in the flight. The other two panthers jump on and all
four creatures crash into the ground. When the dust clears, Momo is seen
pinned to the ground by one of his pursuers while the other two stand
ready to strike their catch. However, before they can, a net flies in,
captures all four of them, and drags them off.

A new shot shows an animal catcher placing Momo into a cage and locking it
by placing a peg in to prevent the doors from opening. As the cart begins
to move away, Momo rubs the clump of Appa fur still tied to his arm
against his face possibly fearing he’ll never see his friend again. Fade
into a scene at what appears to be some sort of butcher, the cart as been
pulled up next to the building. A view from Momo’s perspective in the cage
shows the animal catcher and the butcher arguing, though since this is
from Momo’s standpoint, the dialog is herd as gibberish. Another shot
shows that occupying the cage next to him are the three pygmy panther
scratching at their cage and crying out. Momo utilizes his opposable
thumbs by reaching through the bars and removing the peg that holds his
cage shut. As he pushes the cage open and begins to run away, he stops and
looks back. The pygmy panthers are all staring at him sadly from their
cage, realizing their fate rests with him. Momo leaps back onto the cart
and begins to remove the peg to free them, just as the two men begin to
approach. But when the men reach the cart, they find both cages deserted
as right behind them, Momo and the panthers make their escape on the
rooftops.

Fade into a scene on the roofs of the city, as Momo and his three new
friends sit and watch the clouds. One of the panthers is rubbing up
against Momo in a loving fashion; all three apparently very aware and very
grateful for what Momo just did for them. Suddenly, one of the panthers
uses its mouth to remove the wad of Appa’s fur from Momo’s arm. The
panther with the fur then runs off and Momo, chattering loudly, follows as
well as the other two panthers. The panthers lead Momo through the streets
of Ba-Sing-Se till finally one of them places the wad of fur down inside a
hole in the ground. Momo lands in the hole as the panther runs off. He
looks at this strange hole and realizes immediately that it is actually a
footprint made by none other than the Appa, the very bison Momo has been
desperately trying to find. Chattering softly, Momo lays down on the
ground holding the wad of fur. The camera pulls back to show the panthers
sitting nearby watching as the rain begins to fall on Momo, lying in the
only signature of his long lost friend. Fade to white.)

第十七回
劳改湖
我们找了个画师，帮忙完成了海报
嘿，不是说好设计“寻牛启示”是我的任务吗？
为画好阿柏，我都苦练好几天了
索卡，阿柏的箭头是在它的头顶
这就是头
那上面怎么长出脚来了？
那是犄角
我可是有一阵子没看到它了
哪能记得那么清楚
我觉得你画的不错
多谢，我真的很用心...
你那么说是因为可怜我？
咱们还是赶快把专业版的启示贴出去吧
来吧，伙计们，忙活起来吧
你想必就是沏出如此好茶的幕后高手吧
你的茶已经风靡全城了
包掌柜给你开多少工钱啊？
能与好茶为伴就足矣了
倘若同时有高薪在手岂不更妙
想不想拥有自己的茶馆啊？
我自己的茶馆？
那简直是美梦成真啊！
你这是在干啥？
你不是想挖走我的茶艺师吧？
抱歉了包，人往高处走
这个道理谁都明白
木须，如果你愿意留下来
我就升你当助理经理，不
是高级助理经理
我会给你提供一套位于内环的公寓
那间茶馆你可自主经营
完全随你创意
那我可以自己命名茶馆喽？
那当然
呃，高级行政助理经理如何？
侄子，听见了吗？
这位贵人将会在内环给我们开家茶馆
没错，年轻人
你们马上就要发达了
我还真是喜出望外呢
我刚刚把传单发完
有阿柏的消息了吗？
稍安毋躁，才不过一天而已
哇哦，你说的对
不用担心，消息自会送上门
朱蒂？
安昂，卡塔拉，索卡和拓芙，各位好啊
你前几天去哪了？莫非被戴笠关进大牢了？
什么？坐牢？开什么玩笑
戴笠可是我国文化遗产的捍卫者
可是那次土强王的派对之后你就消失了
哦，我只是去劳改湖度了回带薪假期
还是郊外好，真是疗养胜地
可他们之后派了一位也叫朱蒂的人来替换了你
我才是朱蒂
你今天来这儿有何公干啊？
在本城中，未经允许不得
私发传单、粘贴告示
除非是有十分合理的理由
干什么事都要批准，还让不让人活啊？
根据本城律例，不允许你们继续粘贴寻牛启示
去他的狗屁律例吧，我们可不需要你们的准许
我们要自己去找阿柏
识相的就给我滚开
这下你可捅娄子了
小心他们打击报复
我无所谓，为找到阿柏
从现在开始我们要不惜一切代价
耶！咱们就破它几条狗屁律例吧
朱蒂，你对“神通门”事件的处理让我很是失望啊
我原以为你能够控制住事态的发展
十分抱歉，但是他们不再信任我了
恐怕我再也坚持不下去了
朱蒂，土强王邀请你去劳改湖
能接受到他的邀请是我的荣幸
很好
下去吧，随时待命
如果神通继续寻找它的野牛的话
将会颠覆我们苦心经营的城市平衡
没准还会导致失去对土强王的控制
要我们去干掉他吗？
不了，正面与他交锋过于危险
也许仍然有暗渡陈仓的办法
你看，我正在为我的新茶馆想名字
“茉莉之龙”咋样？
既戏剧化，又有诗意
我很中意
神通就在永固城中，他丢了那头野牛
我们有机会在这里另觅新生
如果你又开始找麻烦
这些来之不易的好事都将化为泡影
那些只是你的好事罢了
你有没有想过，我对生活的渴望远不止
一幢好公寓或是一份茶艺师的工作
享受和平而繁荣的生活并没有什么好的啊
我建议你仔细考虑一下
你到底需要什么样的生活
还有为什么需要？
我要完成我的使命
看你自己如何把握吧
叫“茶虫居”
不行，这名字太蠢了
咱们最好分头行动
这样张贴的范围还能大些
拓芙，不如你跟我一队吧
为啥？难道你们不相信我能自己贴告示？
贴反了是吗？
我还是跟索卡一队好了
卡塔拉
我想我能帮助你
卡塔拉，我变了
杰，拿那些谎话去哄其他女孩吧
我不是来打架的，我是来帮忙的
卡塔拉，出什么事了？
杰回来了
我们再也不能相信杰的那些鬼话了
我们甚至都不知道他为什么会出现在这儿
不管他为什么来这儿
反正不会是什么好原因
我来这儿是为了帮你们找阿柏的
卡塔拉，我们应该给他一个机会
我保证，我已经变了
我曾是个惹是生非的人
无法控制住自己的愤怒
我现在已经不拉帮结伙了
那都已经是前尘往事了
你在说谎
他没说谎
你怎么知道？
我可以感觉到他的呼吸和心跳
人在说谎的时候，呼吸和心跳将会发生变化
他说的是实话
卡塔拉，我们还没有任何线索
既然杰说他能带我们找到阿柏
我们不妨一试
那好吧...
我们会盯紧你的，少耍花样
这就是我听说的地方
这儿啥也没有
如果这是个陷阱...
我跟你说过了，我在附近打工
我听见两个人在谈论说他们
有个巨大的毛怪，我想那应该就是阿柏
它的确来过这儿
我们错过了
他们昨天把那个大东西运走了
好象是用船运到某个岛去，说起时间来
我在这儿打扫这些杂毛和...
呃，和一些残留物都已经一整天了
什么岛？他们把阿柏运到哪儿去了？
领班说鲸尾岛的一位富绅把它买下了
没准要送进动物园展览
要我说，还不如杀了烤肉吃
我们应该赶往鲸尾岛
鲸尾岛在哪儿？
远，那是相当远
在这儿，在南极附近，都快到家了
安昂，可能要花数周的时间才能到达土强国的港口
之后我们还得找艘船才能出发
那无所谓
只要有机会能找到阿柏
我们就要试一下
你去个小岛度假真是不错啊
我都好几年没去度假了
你不是还有很多杂毛没清理干净呢吗？
卸磨杀驴啊，小白眼狼
不需要“老扫帚”就撂一边了
你说的对，安昂，现在找到阿柏是当务之急
等找到它后，可以让它载我们回来
那好，咱们这就出发吧
我跟你们一道去
我们不需要你的帮忙
为什么你就是不肯相信我?
呀，我也想知道呢
这人该不会是你的男朋友吧？
啥？当然不是
你骗不了我，你在说谎~
我们可以坐火车出城，不过之后我们就要步行了
别担心，回来时咱们可以用飞的
终于要离开永固城了
最烂之城
杰
你不是说你已经不拉帮结伙了吗？
我是没有啊
我们可担心你了
你是怎么从戴笠那儿逃出来的？
“戴笠”？
我不知道她在说什么
几个星期前，他被戴笠逮捕了
我们亲眼看见他被拖走了
我怎么会被抓呢？我进城之后一向安分守己
没道理啊，他们都没有说谎
这不可能
不，可能
如果他们说得都是实话
拓芙又怎么能说出谁在说谎
杰被洗脑了
这太疯狂了，怎么会
离我远点
别挡路，芦柴棒
如果你不想和他一个下场
就乖乖的跟我合作
戴笠肯定是想派杰来误导咱们
估计那个清洁工也是他们的同谋
我敢打赌他们一定把阿柏关在城中
也许和关押杰的是同一个地方
他们当初把你关在哪儿？
啥，我根本不知道你们在说啥
我们应该找个办法唤醒他真实的记忆
也许可以让卡塔拉亲他一下
没准他就什么都想起来了
你咋不去亲他呢，索卡
嘿，只是提个建议嘛
狗嘴吐不出象牙
哦，等等，我有主意了
看来你是在白费功夫，呸
试着去想想能够勾起你情感的往事
比如火宗人，还记得他们
是如何对待你的家人的吗？
闭上眼，好好想想
不！那太痛苦了
也许这能让你好过些
他们把我带到一个水下的秘密总部
好像是在个湖下面
等等，记得朱蒂说过
她说她去劳改湖度假了
没错，就是劳改湖
那么，那个秘密总部在哪儿？
我想应该就在湖下面
在湖岸边就有条隧道
我现在都想起来了
我叫朱蒂，欢迎来到永固城
我叫朱蒂，欢迎来到永固城
城墙让我们的城市井井有条
城墙让我们的城市井井有条
我想前面肯定有个足够大的牢房关着阿柏
我想没准就在这儿
没想到会是我吧？
和我想象的有点差距
你们现在已经是国家公敌了
把他们给我抓起来
长风跑了
神通，我已经受够你了
如果你还想见到你的野牛，就乖乖跟我合作
果然是你抓了阿柏，快说它在哪儿？
如果你答应立即离城
我就免除对你的所有指控
并且将你的野牛物归原主
你可没资格跟我们讨价还价
是吗？
那还用说
杰，土强王邀请你去劳改湖
能接受到他的邀请我很荣幸
你现在是我的了
皇叔？
这不是蓝魔吗
我一直都很好奇你到底是谁呢？
你来这里干嘛？
我还要问你呢
如今你找到了神通的野牛
下一步你要做何打算？
继续关在你的新公寓里？
我是不是也应该给它准备一壶茶呢?
离开这儿再说
然后呢？
你从来都没有仔细考虑过这些事情
在北极抓到神通之后你也是这样
你抓到了他，可是不知道该去哪里
我总会想出来的
瞎说！如果不是他的朋友找到你们
你估计早就被冻死了
皇叔，我知道自己的使命
那真是你自己的使命？还是某人强加给你的使命？
别说了，皇叔，我别无选择
我求你了，祖寇殿下
是时候该扪心自问，拷问自己这些关键问题了
你到底是谁？你要的究竟是什么？
杰，我是安昂啊！
你不需要这么做的
恐怕他没有别的选择
杰，我是你的朋友，听听你内心的声音
杰，完成你的使命
他不能强迫你做这些
你可是名自由战士
杀了他！现在就杀了他！
傻孩子，你这是在自寻灭亡
对不起，安昂
不是你的错
伤势很重
你们去找阿柏吧，我们会照顾好杰的
我们不会丢下你们不管的
时间不多了，快去
我们会照顾好他的，他是我们的头
别担心卡塔拉，我不会有事的
他在说谎
阿柏不在了
长风还是早了我们一步
如果我们继续追的话，还能追得上
你觉得咱们能甩掉他们吗？
应该不成问题
怎么了，模模？
阿柏
我一个人就能摆平你
耶，阿柏
你可让我想死了，伙计
皇侄，你做出了正确的选择
就让往事随风吧
-=未完待续=-

水善国
土强国
火烈国
气和国
很久以前，这四大国和谐共处
然而，烈火国发起的战争结束了和平
只有同时掌握四种元素的降世神通才能结束战争
然而在大家最需要他的时候，他却消失了
年后，我和哥哥发现了转世的降世神通，
他是个御气师，名叫“安昂”
尽管他的御气术着实厉害
在拯救苍生之前，他要学的还有很多
但是我坚信
安昂 能拯救这个世界
-=降世神通=-
最后的气宗

降世神通 前情提要
火会越煽越旺的，这道理你都不懂吗？
敝人长风，戴笠的总领
为什么你不让我们觐见国王
土强王可没有闲功夫浪费在政治争斗上
这么说土强王只是个傀儡？
他只是你手中的玩偶
是时候该扪心自问，拷问自己这些关键问题了
你到底是谁？你要的究竟是什么？
我一个人就能摆平你
你可把我给想死了，伙计
