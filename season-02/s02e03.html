[Introduction sequence]

Act I

(The scene opens with a shot of the sun in the sky. An instant later the
camera zooms back to reveal a Fire Nation flag in the foreground,
fluttering in the wind. Cut to a wide, long shot of the fallen city of
Omashu. The Fire Nation flag hangs over the newly installed front gate.
The path up to the city gate has been recently broken along a good portion
of its length and been repaired. Around the fortress the scaffolding of
what appear to be siege towers can be seen. Columns of smoke still rise
from various places in the city. The camera zooms back again to show Aang
in the foreground, back to the camera.)

Aang: I can&#x27;t believe it. I know the war has spread far, (he turns to face
his friends) but Omashu always seemed...untouchable.

(Cut to a frontal shot of Aang, again looking at the fallen city. Aang,
Katara, Momo and Appa are behind him.)

Sokka: Up until now, it was. Now Ba-Sing-Se is the only great Earth
Kingdom stronghold left.
Katara: This is horrible, but we have to move on.
Aang: (firmly) No. I&#x27;m going in to find Bumi.
Sokka: Aang, stop. We don\&#x27;t even know if Bumi&#x27;s still...

(Aang turns to look at Sokka, his expression hardening.)

Aang (defiantly): What? If he&#x27;s still what?
Sokka: (refusing to meet Aang&#x27;s eyes) ...around.
Katara: I know you had your heart set on Bumi, but there are other people
around who can teach you earthbending.
Aang: This isn&#x27;t about finding a teacher. This is about finding my friend.

(Cut back to a wide, long shot of the smoking city, with the kids in the
foreground., then cut to a shot of the new city gate. It&#x27;s turrets, guard
house roofing and even the paifang in front of the main gate are all built
in Fire Nation architectural style. Behind the city wall, smokestacks and
scaffolding are seen.

The camera pans down the city wall and fades to indicate a location skip.
The fade ends to show a long shot of Appa floating deep down in the city&#x27;s
moat. Appa floats beside a ledge at the base of the Omashu side of the
moat. Appa grunts a bit as he floats.)

Sokka: (from o.c.) A secret passage?

(Cut to a shot of Katara, Momo on her shoulder, and Sokka standing in
front of a capped drain pipe emerging from the wall. Aang is atop the
pipe, using his staff as a lever to try and open the drain. Appa floats
peacefully in the background.)

Sokka: Why didn&#x27;t we just use this last time? (The cap pops off, releasing
a huge gout of greenish sewage, some of which washes over Sokka.) Ugh!
Aang: Does that answer your question?

(Cut to a shot from inside the pipe. The greenish sewage continues to pour
out of the pipe as Aang swings inside and disappears up the pipe, a smile
on his face. Katara, Sokka and Momo look into the pipe and the flies that
are buzzing around it. Sokka jumps into the pipe and covers his nose as he
moves forward.)

Sokka: Ew!

(Cut to a side shot of Aang, a determined expression on his face, as he
airbends the sewage out of his way with his staff. The camera pans slowly
down the pipe to reveal Katara traveling in his wake, and then Sokka, who
is making plenty of &quot;ew!&quot; and &quot;ick!&quot; noises as he is slowly covered in
sewage from Aang&#x27;s receding wake.

Cut to an exterior shot of an Omashu city street and its skyline. The
camera pans down to reveal a sewer manhole in the middle of the road. A
puff of air pops the manhole open for a second. It settles back for a
moment before Aang pushes it open with his hands and peers out. Cut to his
p.o.v. as he looks around. The street is empty. Cut to a wide shot of the
street as Aang drops the manhole cover and jumps out into the open. Katara
emerges behind him.)

Katara: That wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought.

(Cut to a shot of the manhole, where a blob of green sewage emerges. An
alien like sound effect plays in the background as the things lifts itself
onto the street. It moans like some monster from Scooby-Doo. Cut to Aang
and Katara, who both look horrified. Katara spies something to her left,
then cut quickly to a wider shot where she bends some water from a nearby
water barrel at the monster. The water washes the gunk away to reveal
Sokka, who yells in surprise, then slumps, sopping wet. Aang swings his
staff at the water tribe boy, whipping a gale that blows him dry, once
again producing an outcry from his target.

Cut to a close shot of Sokka, who raises his head to reveal two purple
octopus like creatures stuck to either side of his head. He is unaware of
his guests until a second later they both palpitate a bit and squeak.)

Sokka: Aaahhh!

(Sokka grabs one creature in each hand and tries to pull them from his
face, but their suckers keep them attached. He stretches them out to an
absurd distance, but still they hang on.)

Sokka: Aaahh! Aahhh! They won&#x27;t let go! Help! Aaaak!

(Cut to a wider shot of the three as Aang pounces on Sokka, pinning him to
the nearby wall, then releasing him. Sokka now sits on a crate, a sour and
resigned look on his face.)

Aang: Stop making so much noise. It&#x27;s just a purple pentapus.

(Cut to a close up of Sokka&#x27;s face. The pentapus&#x27; begin to palpitate
again, making slight squishing noises. Sokka&#x27;s eyes bug out as he looks to
either side of his face in horror and terrified, but slightly choked
noises emerge from his throat.

Aang&#x27;s hand enters the frame from the right and grips the nearest
pentapus. He rubs its head with his finger. It raises its tentacles from
Sokka&#x27;s cheek and pops off his face without further fuss. Cut to a wider
shot of Sokka and Aang. While rubbing his free cheek, Sokka repeats the
process on the other side of his face. The other pentapus squeaks a bit
and releases Sokka&#x27;s right check with another little popping sound. The
suckers on the tentacles have left little round red dots all over Sokka&#x27;s
cheeks. Sokka rubs his cheek for a second and Aang&#x27;s removes a third
pentapus from behind Sokka\&#x27;s neck before they are interrupted.)

Guard: (from o.c.) Hey!

(Cut to a patrol of Fire Nation guards entering the street, then cut back
to the kids. Sokka and Katara close ranks to obscure Aang for a moment,
who disappears and reappears a second later with a red, flat top hat on to
hide his airbender tattoo.)

Guard: What are you kids doing out past curfew?
Katara: Sorry. We were just on our way home.

(The kids turn and walk away, Sokka bringing up the rear. The guard
notices the red welts on the back of Sokka&#x27;s neck.)

Guard: (from o.c.) Wait! What&#x27;s the matter with him?

(The kids stop and turn around. Katara puts her hands on her brother&#x27;s
shoulders.)

Katara: Uh...he has pentapox, sir.

(The guard walks up to Sokka, and moves to touch him.)

Katara: (a pleasing, earnest look in her eyes) Um...it&#x27;s highly
contagious!

(The guard hesitates, then pulls his hand back. Cut to a close up of
Sokka\&#x27;s face, who realizes the ploy and begins to act ill. He raises his
hands in front of him in a zombie-like fashion and begins to moan.)

Sokka: Uuuuuu....It&#x27;s so awful...I&#x27;m dyiiiing...
Katara: ...and deadly...

(Sokka continues to moan and lurch forward, the guards begin to lurch
backward to avoid contact.)

Guard: Wait, I think I&#x27;ve heard of pentapox. (to one of his comrades)
Didn&#x27;t your cousin Chang die of it? (Sokka advances, coughing and spitting
up gunk at them) We&#x27;d better go wash our hands...and burn our clothes!

(Guards exit the left of the frame at a run. Sokka stops his act and
straighten up. Cut to a shot of Aang in the foreground, Sokka behind. The
Avatar, smiling, is rubbing the head of a pentapus he holds his hand.)

Aang: Thank you, sewer friend!

(Cut to a long, overhead shot of Princess Azula&#x27;s ship beside a beach. It
is night, and the full moon hangs overhead. The beach is filled with tents
and is populated with people from Azula&#x27;s royal procession. Cut to a long
shot of Azula sitting within her litter which rests atop the dais on the
deck on her ship. She is flanked on either side by her crone teachers.
Below them on the deck, a row of Fire Nation soldiers lie prostrate on
either side of the ship.)

Crone Teacher #1: (from o.c. at first) When tracking your brother and
uncle, traveling with a royal procession may no longer be an option.
Crone Teacher #2: May no longer be wise...if you hope to keep the element
of surprise.
Azula: You&#x27;re right. The royal procession is dead weight. If I want to
catch my prey, I must be agile....nimble. I need a small, elite team. It&#x27;s
time to visit some old friends.
(Cut to a shot from somewhere in Omashu. The camera pans down to show the
kids looking around and moving ahead while trying to escape detection. The
hide behind some construction material as a patrol passes.)

Katara: Let&#x27;s find Bumi and get out of here.
Sokka: Where would they be keeping him?
Aang: Somewhere he can&#x27;t earthbend. (looking up and around, cut to Aang&#x27;s
p.o.v. as he pans around) Somewhere made of metal.

(Cut to a close up of a young woman with a large quantity of well coifed
black hair. Her expression is emotionless, her eyes golden or light brown.
Behind her walk two Fire Nation guards.)

Mai: There really is no fathoming the depths of my hatred for this place.

(Cut to a wider shot to show Mai walking next to an older woman carrying a
baby. They are being escorted by Fire Nation guards down a tunnel or
passage.)

Governor&#x27;s Wife: Mai, your father was appointed governor. We&#x27;re like
royalty here. Be happy, and enjoy it.

(Cut to a long, overhead shot from higher up in the city as Mai&#x27;s party
exits the fortress passage and emerges out into the open. It is still
night and the torches of Mai&#x27;s party can clearly beseen below. In the
foreground is the beginning of one of Omashu&#x27;s famous chutes which ends
near where the party is walking below. The camera zooms back to show an
overhead view of an Earth Kingdom resistance fighter who looks down at the
torches, then back to someone off screen. In front of him are some rocks
or other objects ready to be dropped down the chute.)

Resistance Fighter #1: The targets are approaching.

(Cut to a close up an earthbender&#x27;s bearded face, his eyes obscured by his
helmet.)

Resistance Leader: Take them out.

(Cut back to Mai and her party walking below.)

Mai: (distressed, but in a dull tone) I thought my life was boring in the
Fire Nation. But this place is unbearably bleak. Nothing ever happens.

(Cut back to the resistance fighter above. He launches the rocks into the
tube which go crashing down at high speed. Cut to Aang who looks in horror
at the falling debris, then over at the party of people passing to his
left who will soon be crushed by the falling objects. Shift to a side view
of Aang, Katara and Sokka behind him. Aang stands just next to the bottom
of the chute as the rocks enter the frame from above. Mai and her party
are slightly below him on the plaza itself. The Avatar raises his staff
and pulverizes the rocks into pebbles and dust as it passes with a blast
of air. Cut to a wide, overhead shot from across the plaza, clearly
showing Mai&#x27;s party, the kids, and the huge cloud of dust from the foiled
assassination attempt. A few moments of silence pass as Mai looks at Aang
and Aang looks back at her and the rest of her party. Cut to a wide shot
of Mai&#x27;s group looking up out of the frame at Aang.)

Governor&#x27;s Wife: (pointing at Aang) The resistance!

(Cut to Mai, who smiles slightly and in an instant fans out her arms,
releasing a hail of small arrows. Cut to Aang, who dodges the arrows which
embed themselves on the stack of construction material he is standing on,
then to a wider shot as Aang, Katara and Sokka run out of the frame to the
right, pursued by Fire Nation soldiers who climb up a couple ladders from
the plaza below. Katara turns and using the water from water skin she
whips them off the ledge and onto the plaza below.

Cut to a stylized shot of Mai running at Katara, her arms spread to either
side. A close of up shot of Mai&#x27;s hand appears a split second later. She
fires another hail of from some unknown mechanism around her hand and
forearm. Her nails are long and black. Cut to Katara, who creates a wall
of ice in front her, stopping the arrows. Mai continues the pursuit as
Katara flees. Aang lets Katara pass as he turns to face Mai. As his
assailant approaches, Aang causes some construction scaffolding on his
right to collapse between them. As the scaffolding collapses, Mai is able
to get one, ornate throwing star through the falling debris. Aang twirls
his staff in front of him and stops it just in time. The dust from the
falling scaffolding clears, once again giving Mai a clear shot. She throws
another hail of arrows, but the kids disappear through a large trap door
which closes instantly above them. Cut back to Mai, who sighs amidst the
wreckage, turns, and walks away.

Cut to a tunnel scene which the kids have just fallen into. Green sewage
drips from the ceiling. Pan down to reveal the kids sitting on the floor
of the tunnel where they fell from above. Aang and Sokka rub their heads.
Cut to a shot of the bearded Earth Kingdom soldier who gave the order to
go ahead with the failed attack.

Cut to an upside down shot of some grass. The camera pans up to reveal an
upside down frame showing some red and pink circus tents with mountains in
the background. A few people are working on finishing tent set up and
rolling barrels around. Azula, also upside down, walks into the frame and
addresses the camera.)

Azula: Ty Lee, could that possibly be you?

(Cut to a right side up shot of someone performing a head stand on their
index fingers. The camera pans up to reveal a pretty, bright eyed girl
with a long black pony tail, dressed in pink and red. She smiles widely.)

Ty Lee: Azula!

(Cut to a wider shot from near Azula\&#x27;s p.o.v. Ty Lee breaks her head
stand with a couple graceful moves. She prostrates herself on the ground,
then runs and gives Azula a bear hug. Azula smiles and returns the hug.)

Ty Lee: It is so good to see you!

Azula: (smiling) Please, don&#x27;t let me interrupt your... (raises an
eyebrow, searching for the right word and failing) whatever it is you were
doing.

(Ty Lee, still smiling, flips over backwards and ends up lying on her
chest, with one of her feet arched over in front of her head, the other
pointing straight up into the air. In the background, three circus people
try unsuccessfully to coax a platypus bear dressed in red vest and wearing
a fez to move.)

Azula: Tell me, what is the daughter of a nobleman doing here? Certainly
our parents didn&#x27;t send us to the Royal Fire Academy for Girls to end up
in... (cut to a shot of the efforts with the platypus bear, Azula
continues, with a slight note of contempt in her voice) places like this.

(The platypus bears groan and then gets up with a slight popping noise to
reveal that it has laid an egg.)

Azula: I have a proposition for you. I&#x27;m hunting a traitor. (Looking at
her wrist a bit absent mindedly) You remember my old fuddy duddy uncle,
don&#x27;t you?
Ty Lee: (still resting on her chest and elbows, but now with both feet
planted on her head) Oh yeah. He was so funny.
Azula: I would be honored if you would join me on my mission.
Ty Lee: Oh...I...uh...would love to. (Springs back to her feet in a
single, fluid motion) But the truth is, I&#x27;m really happy here. (Smiling
serenely) I mean, my aura has never been pinker!
Azula: I\&#x27;ll take your word for it. Well, I wouldn&#x27;t want you to give up
the life you love just to please me.
Ty Lee: (bowing slightly and clasping her hands in a gesture of thanks)
Thank you, Azula.

(Azula walks away as Ty Lee turns and with a smile raises her leg to her
head in an impressive stretch. Azula turns to address her once more.)

Azula: Of course, before I leave, I&#x27;m going to catch your show.

(An expression of panic spreads over Ty Lee&#x27;s face, which faces away from
Azula, and she loses her grip on her leg. She recovers and grips her leg
once more, a sad and worried expression on her face.)

Ty Lee: Uh...yeah...sure...uh...of course...

(Azula walks away in the background.

Cut to an underground cavern under Omashu. It is filled with Earth Kingdom
resistance fighters. The kids and the Resistance Leader stand on the ledge
in front of the main exit tunnel from the room, which is lit by several
lamps hanging from the walls.)

Aang: So, is King Bumi with you guys? Is he leading the resistance?

(Cut to a close shot of the resistance leader.)

Resistance Leader: (With quiet intensity) Of course not! The day of the
invasion, we readied ourselves for battle. We were prepared to defend our
city...to fight for our lives and for our freedom. But before we even had
a chance, King Bumi surrendered.

(Cut to a zooming in shot of Aang, clearly disconcerted at this news.
Katara looks at Aang in concern. Cut to black for commercial break.

Act II

Return to another shot of the underground cavern filled with resistance
fighters. Cut to a shot of the kids standing in front of the Resistance
Leader, their backs to the camera.)

Resistance Leader: The day of the invasion, I asked King Bumi what he
wanted to do. (Cut to a zooming in close up of the Resistance Leader) He
looked me in the eye and said...

(The screen flashes white and the audience enters a flashback from the
Resistance Leader\&#x27;s memory. King Bumi stands atop one of the city walls,
the Resistance Leader next to him. They look in front of them off screen.
Fireballs arch into the city overhead. Cut to a profile shot of Bumi&#x27;s
head.)

King Bumi: I&#x27;m going to do... (he turns to face the camera) nothing!

(At this Bumi begins to laugh and snort maniacally. In the background, the
carnival music often heard when Bumi was onscreen in &quot;The King of Omashu&quot;
returns again here. The flashback ends and is replaced by a close up of
the Resistance Leader.)

Resistance Leader: It doesn&#x27;t matter now. Fighting the Fire Nation is the
only path to freedom. And freedom is worth dying for.
Aang: Actually there&#x27;s another path to freedom. You could leave Omashu.
You&#x27;re directing all your energy to fight the Fire Nation. (Cut to a
panning shot of the resistance fighters around them, all clearly listening
to Aang, the camera ultimately resting back on the Resistance Leader.) But
you&#x27;re outnumbered. You can&#x27;t win. Now&#x27;s the time to retreat, so you can
live to fight another day.
Resistance Leader: You don&#x27;t understand. They\&#x27;ve taken our home, and
(making forceful hand motions for added emphasis) we have to fight them at
ANY cost!
Resistance Fighter #1: I don&#x27;t know, (unintelligible word that sounds like
&quot;Ya&quot; and might be the Resistance Leader&#x27;s name), living to fight another
day is startin&#x27; to sound pretty good to me.
Resistance Fighter #2: (stepped forward from behind Resistance Fighter #1)
Yeah, I&#x27;m with the kid!

(Cut to a close up of the Resistance Leader who looks down into the cavern
where the other fighters and displaced citizens of Omashu whisper their
agreement.)

Resistance Leader: (turning back to the kids) Fine. But there&#x27;s thousands
of citizens that need to leave. How&#x27;re we going to get them all out?

(Cut to Sokka, stroking his chin, thinking. He comes up with an idea.)

Sokka: Suckers!

(Cut to a shot from Sokka&#x27;s p.o.v., the rest of the group staring at him.
Momo chitters questioningly. Cut back to Sokka whose eyes dart back and
forth to a sound effect.)

Sokka: You&#x27;re all about to come down with a nasty case of pentapox.

(Camera pans down at high speed indicating a scene change. A bucket of
water and about a dozen pentapi appear. A hand reaches in and grabs one,
which squeaks. Cut to some resistance fighters, now above ground somewhere
in the city, applying pentapi to their exposed skin. The pentapi undulate
a bit and leave their red marks when removed. After some time, Sokka
addresses a crowd of sick looking citizens and resistance fighters.)

Sokka: The marks make ya look sick, but you gotta ACT sick, too. Ya gotta
sell it!

(An old man walks between Sokka and the crowd, groaning pathetically and
holding a hand to his allegedly aching back.)

Sokka: (putting his arm around an earth kingdom citizen next to him) Now
that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m talkin&#x27; about.

(Cut to a shot of the old man looking back at Sokka. He taps his wooden
leg with his cane and smiles.)

Old Man: Years of practice.

(Cut to a profile shot of Sokka, Aang and Katara behind him, pointing
toward the city and raising his voice to address the crowd.)

Sokka: Okay everyone! Into sick formation.

(The citizens and Sokka walk left out of the frame. Katara moves to join,
but turns as Aang heads in a different direction. Momo chitters
excitedly.)

Katara: Aang, what are you doing? Aren&#x27;t you coming with us.
Aang: (turning to face her) No. I&#x27;m not leaving until I find Bumi.

(Momo jumps onto Aang shoulder and chitters. He grabs Aang&#x27;s mouth, but
Aang picks him up and drops him on the floor.)

Aang: Sorry Momo, I&#x27;ll feed you later.

(Aang airbends himself to the surrounding rooftops and bounds away.

Cut to a shot of the sun in the sky. The screen pans down in a flash to
some Fire Nation soldiers. Zombie like noises are heard from o.c., before
a cut to an approaching crowd of &quot;sick&quot; Omashu citizens. Soon it is clear
that several mobs of people are approaching the soldiers, all moaning,
some even falling over, &quot;dead&quot;. Cut to a close up of Sokka, Katara visible
over his shoulder, both covered in red splotches and moaning, then cut
back to the Fire Nation soldiers who are now terrified.)

Soldier: Plague! Plague!

(The soldier turn and run back to the citadel behind them. Cut to a view
from above where a Fire Nation soldier is banging an alarm. Below, the
moaning citizens advance as the guards run away.

Cut to a panoramic shot of the city from the one of the balconies of the
Governor&#x27;s mansion. The Governor, his wife and their baby son, Mai and
some guards enter the screen from the bottom of the frame. Cut to a
frontal shot of them as they look out over the city.)

Governor: What is going on down there?
Guard: I saw some kids yesterday who were sick with pentapox. It must have
spread!
Governor: Pentapox! I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve heard of that.
Governor&#x27;s Wife: Oh, this is terrible.
Guard: What should we do?
Governor: Drive them out of the city...but don\&#x27;t touch them! We have to
rid the city of this disease!

(The guard bows and leaves. Mai offers her father the bowl she is
carrying.)

Mai: Fire flakes, Dad?

(Cut to a shot from behind. The Governor&#x27;s wife hugs her husband.)

Governor&#x27;s Wife: (gasping) How awful!

(The baby toddles away from the group and out of the frame. Cut to Aang
airbending himself through the city. From a rooftop he spies Flopsie,
chained to a millstone. On his hind legs, Flopsie pushes the turnstile
that drives the mill. He is alone while performing this backbreaking work.
Aang jumps down.)

Aang: Flopsie!

(Aang stands with his hands outstretched to receive a hug, but Flopsie is
restrained by his chain. He makes unhappy noises. Aang jumps onto the
turnstile, waterbends some water from a nearby cistern and freezes it
around the chain where it is connected to the turnstile. Aang then breaks
the chain with his staff. Flopsie lunges forward, scoops Aang up in a hug
and licks him.)

Aang: (climbing on top of Flopsie) Come on, Flopsie. You gotta help me
find Bumi. Yip Yip! Oh...I guess that doesn&#x27;t work with you. Let&#x27;s go!

(Flopsie and Aang take off at high speed into the streets of Omashu.

Cut to Momo flying through the air and landing in the Governor&#x27;s palace.
He enters through a window into the Governor&#x27;s baby son&#x27;s room. Cut to
Momo&#x27;s p.o.v., where he sees a little teddy bear bouncing up and down over
the top of a set of art or dressing panels near the back of the room,
which is filled with toys. The sound of a baby playing is heard.

Momo spies a platter of berries on a nearby table and jumps over to it. He
begins to eat the berries and spitting the seeds over the art panels. Cut
to the baby who stops throwing the teddy bear around when he notices the
seeds falling around him. He crawls around the panel and underneath the
table Momo is sitting on. The child is captivated by the flying lemur&#x27;s
tail, which hangs over the side of the table. The child reaches up, grabs
Momo&#x27;s tail and pulls him to the ground in mid bite.

Dragging the child behind him, Momo tries to escape. The child lets go and
Momo runs out onto the railing of the balcony. He turns to see the child,
still laughing and smiling, has followed him. He lunges for Momo, but
misses. Momo flies off, but the child falls down the tiles of the roof
beneath them and lands in a box of berries traveling down one of Omashu\&#x27;s
many chutes.

Momo lands on the box of berries and begins eating again, only to have the
child emerge from the berries behind him. Momo looks over in some horror
at the child, who grabs his tail before he can react. The lemur jumps into
the air, beating his wings frantically trying to get away. Finally, the
box drops off beneath them as it drops down another chute. Momo gets the
airborne, but can&#x27;t bear the weight for long. Soon, they are both dragging
on the floor of a nearby plaza. The child lands on top of Momo, who is
pinned to the floor.

Suddenly, a host of moaning Omashu citizens begins to pass by them. Momo
gets up and runs after the citizens and the baby follows Momo out of the
city\&#x27;s main gate.

Cut to a night shot of a brightly lit circus tent, which cuts quickly to a
shot of some performers in two Chinese style dragon costumes. The dragons
jump out of the frame to reveal the Circus Master addressing the crowd.
Behind him is the circus&#x27; main ring.)

Circus Master: We&#x27;re deeply honored to have the Fire Lord&#x27;s daughter at
our humble circus.

(Cut to a shot from behind the Circus Master. Azula and two guards reside
in a box seat high above him, richly decorated in Fire Nation livery. The
rest of the circus looks empty.)

Circus Master: Uh...tell us if there is anything we can do to make the
show more enjoyable.
Azula: I will.

(Cut to wide, long shot of the main circus ring. A net is stretched across
it. Pan up to show Ty Lee wearing colorful clothing and a golden tiara
like head piece doing a head stand using one hand holding a short stick.
This stick in turn is balanced on top of what looks like the frame of a
small tent. Incredibly, this tent frame, in its turn, balances on a high
wire. Cut back to the Circus Master and Azula.)

Azula: Incredible. Do you think she&#x27;ll fall?
Circus Master: Of course not.
Azula: Then wouldn&#x27;t it make it more interesting if you removed the net?
Circus Master: (concerned) Uh...the thing is...the performers...
Azula: You&#x27;re right, you&#x27;re right. That&#x27;s been done. (After a short pause)
I know. Set the net on fire.

Circus Master: Of course, Princess.

(He stands and shoots a gout of flame at the net which promptly catches
fire. Cut to a close up shot of Ty Lee&#x27;s face, the fire from the net
reflecting on her face as she still remains balanced on the high wire.
Sweat pours down her unhappy face. Cut back to Azula and the Circus
Master, who looks up tensely towards Ty Lee off screen, his fists balled
in frustration.)

Azula: Brilliant, just brilliant! (She looks back down at the Circus
Master) Oooo, what kind of dangerous animals do you have?
Circus Master: Well, our circus boasts the most exotic assortment...
Azula: (cutting him off) Release them all!

(Cut back to a zoom in shot of Ty Lee&#x27;s terrified, sweaty face, then cut
to an exterior shot of the tent as the sound of wild animals erupts from
within. The camera pans up to a shot of the full moon before cutting to
shot panning down on the newly formed camp of Omashu citizens somewhere
outside the city.

Cut to Aang and Flopsie walking towards the camp, Flopsie making vaguely
tired grunts. Sokka and Katara get up from a nearby fire and come over to
him.)

Aang: (sadly) We looked everywhere. No Bumi.

(Katara hugs Aang. Flopsie makes sad noises, and Sokka hugs him. The
Resistance Leader walks up behind them.)

Resistance Leader: We\&#x27;ve got a problem. We just did a head count.
Katara: Oh no. Did someone get left behind?
Resistance Leader: No, (pointing o.c. to the right) we have an extra.

(Cut to Momo walking to the left of the frame, a terrified expression on
his face due to the baby attached to him around his neck. The baby is
laughing as he hugs the befuddled lemur. Momo drags off the left side of
the frame. Cut back to the kids and the Resistance Leader watching Momo
drag the baby around.

Scene shift to an exterior shot of the Governor&#x27;s palace, the cut to
Governor&#x27;s wife seated in a chair on the balcony, sobbing. Mai stands next
to her and offers her a handkerchief.)

Governor: So, the resistance has kidnapped my son. (exasperated)
Everything so clever, so tricky. Just like their King Bumi.
Guard: (from behind) What do you want to do, sir?

(The Governor turns from him and looks back out over the city and the full
moon above it.

Cut to a shot of a bouquet of what look like dead roses dropped
unceremoniously on a table, then cut to a wider shot of Azula standing
behind Ty Lee who is seated at her dressing table. The roses had been
dumped on her dressing table.)

Azula: What an exquisite performance. I can&#x27;t wait to see how you&#x27;ll top
yourself tomorrow.

(Cut to a closer shot of Ty Lee looking at Azula&#x27;s reflection in her
mirror, smiling.)

Ty Lee: I&#x27;m sorry Azula, but unfortunately there won&#x27;t be a show tomorrow.

Azula: Really?

Ty Lee: (hanging up her tiara) The universe has given me strong hints that
it&#x27;s time for a career change. I want to join you on your mission.

(Cut to a profile shot of the two as Ty Lee turns to face Azula, then cut
to a close up of Azula who looks satisfied at having gotten her way again.

Cut back to the camp of Omashu citizens, then to a quick shot of Aang and
the others around a campfire. Cut again to the baby wandering around after
Momo and making cute noises. They arrive at Katara and Sokka, his water
tribe club lying on the ground. The baby picks up the club and starts to
suck on it. The screen expands as Sokka grabs it and holds it away.)

Sokka: No! Bad Fire Nation baby!

(The baby begins to cry. Katara looks over at her brother crossly, whacks
him across the face and places her hands on her hips.)

Sokka: Oh...alright.

(The baby stops crying and begins to play with the club.)

Katara: (leaning over to hug the baby from behind) Ooo, you&#x27;re so CUTE.
Mmmmm...

(Cut to the Resistance Leader sitting on the other side of the camp fire.)

Resistance Leader: Sure he&#x27;s cute now, but when he\&#x27;s older, (cut back to
Sokka and Katara, still hugging the baby, he continues from o.c.) he&#x27;ll
join the Fire Nation army. You won\&#x27;t think he&#x27;s so cute then. He&#x27;ll be a
killer.

Katara: (picking the baby up, who still clearly wants to play with the
club) Does that look like the face of a killer to you?

(Cut to a brief shot of the Resistance Leader&#x27;s grave face before cutting
to a messenger hawk screaming across the moonlit night. Cut to the p.o.v.
from a nearby rock that overseas the camp. The hawk lands on the rock.)

Resistance Leader: A messenger hawk!

(Fade to Aang unrolling the message brought by the hawk.)

Aang: It&#x27;s from the Fire Nation governor. He thinks we kidnapped his son.
So...he wants to make a trade. His son (the camera rotates around Aang for
additional effect) for King Bumi.

(Cut to black for commercial break.

Act III

The show returns to a shot of a partly cloudy sky. The camera pans down to
reveal Aang looking out over an expanse of mountains, his back to the
camera. After a moment&#x27;s pause, Aang walks down the hill and out of the
frame. Cut to a profile shot of Aang, carrying the baby in his arms,
walking down the hill towards Sokka, Katara and Momo below him.)

Sokka: You realize we&#x27;re probably walking right into a trap?
Aang: I don&#x27;t think so. I&#x27;m sure the Governor wants his son back as much
as we want Bumi. It&#x27;s a new day. (Cut to a wide, overhead shot of the
group and the sun and mountains behind them) I have a good feeling about
this.

(Cut to a shot of several Fire Nation guards carrying Azula&#x27;s litter on
their shoulder through one of Omashu&#x27;s plazas. Cut to a profile view of
Azula sitting in her litter. Cut to a short, pan right still of Mai
standing at the foot of a large, white staircase, then cut to an overhead
shot of the guards lowering the litter to the ground in front of Mai.
Azula gets out walks over to Mai, joined quickly by Ty Lee.)

Mai: (bowing, speaking in a dull voice) Please tell me you&#x27;re here to kill
me.

(Cut to a close up of Mai, who looks up slightly and smiles. Cut back to a
wider shot of the three as Mai and Azula begin to laugh.)

Azula: (hugging Mai) It&#x27;s great to see you, Mai.

(Ty Lee runs over and hugs Mai.)

Mai: (somewhat surprised) I thought you ran off and joined the circus? You
said it was your calling.
Ty Lee: (releasing Mai and smiling widely) Well, Azula called a little
louder.
Azula: I have a mission (she puts one of her hands on each of their
shoulders) and I need you both.
Mai: Count me in. Anything to get me out of this place.

(Cut to a shot of the Fire Nation flag which quickly pans down to reveal
Azula sitting in the Governor&#x27;s chair, flanked by guards. In front of her
stand the Governor, his wife, and Azula&#x27;s friends.)

Governor: I apologize.

(Cut to a closer shot of the Governor kneeling on a red pillow, looking up
at Azula off screen in trepidation, his hands held out before him in a
pleading gesture.)

Governor: You&#x27;ve come to Omashu at a difficult time. At noon we&#x27;re making
a trade with the resistance to get Tom-Tom back.
Azula: Yes, I&#x27;m so sorry to hear about your son, (she crosses her legs in
front of her) but really, what did you expect by just letting all the
citizens leave? (She stands, suddenly angry, and looks down upon him) My
father has trusted you with this city (she makes a slashing gesture with
her left hand) and you&#x27;re making a mess of things!
Governor: (prostrating himself) Forgive me, Princess.

(Azula walks between the Governor and her two friends. Cut to a view from
the Governor&#x27;s p.o.v., Azula looking down at him.)

Azula: You stay here. (Mai and Ty Lee stand up behind her) Mai will handle
the hostage trade so you don&#x27;t have a chance to mess it up. (Cut to
several exterior shots of the still smoking city and several construction
projects within, continue Azula voice over) And there is no more &quot;Omashu&quot;.
I&#x27;m renaming it in honor of my father, the City of New Ozai.

(Cut to a long, overhead shot of Aang, still wearing his hat, Katara and
Sokka at the bottom of the scaffolding of a huge statue that is under
construction, then cut to close shot of them that pans slowly left. Each
of them looks ahead with defiance. Sokka holds the baby.

Cut to their p.o.v. as Mai, Azula and Ty Lee mount the platform. Mai leads
the group. Cut to a wide overhead shot from somewhere near the top of the
statue under construction. The two groups face each other at opposite ends
of the construction platform. The scene is filled with tension. Cut to the
stop of the scaffolding where a crane is lowering a metal coffin suspended
by a chain. Inside, the laughing and snorting King Bumi can be heard. Sure
enough, the coffin twists on the chain to reveal Bumi&#x27;s face, visible
through a porthole just large enough for his face.)

King Bumi: Hi, everybody!

(The coffin lands standing straight up behind Mai and her friends.)

Mai: You brought my brother?
Aang: He&#x27;s here. We&#x27;re ready to trade.
Azula: (to Mai, Bumi grinning behind them all) I&#x27;m sorry, but a thought
just occurred to me. Do you mind?
Mai: (turning to Azula): Of course not, Princess Azula.
Azula: We&#x27;re trading a two year old for a king. (She turns to Bumi) A
powerful, earthbending king?

(Bumi smiles, closes his eyes, and nods at her.)

King Bumi: Mmm hmmm!
Azula: (turning back to Mai) It just doesn&#x27;t seem like a fair trade, does
it?

(Mai looks away from Azula and o.c. towards her brother in Sokka&#x27;s arms.
Cut to a shot from behind Aang and Sokka, the baby cooing over Sokka&#x27;s
shoulder, then cut back to Mai who begins to walk forward.)

Mai: You&#x27;re right. (To Aang) The deal&#x27;s off.

(She raises her left hand and Bumi is lifted back off the ground as the
chain is reeled in from above.)

King Bumi: (enjoying himself) Whhhoa! See you all later!

(Cut to Bumi&#x27;s p.o.v. to show Aang, Sokka and Katara receding below as he
is hauled up. Bumi continues to laugh and snort from o.c.)

Aang: Bumi!

(Cut to a shot from behind Aang as he rushes forwards towards Mai, Azula
and Ty Lee. As he approaches, the shot cuts to a profile view of Azula on
the left of the frame. She bends a plume of whitish blue fire at knee
level towards Aang, who enters the frame from the right and jumps high
into the air to avoid it. He lands and part of the partially constructed
building and jumps off again. He opens his glider in mid air, but loses
his hat, exposing his tattoo. He grabs the hat with his mouth before it
flies away, but it is too late, Azula has recognized him.)

Azula: (in surprise) The Avatar! (Cut to a quick shot of Aang spiraling
upwards with his glider, then back to Azula, who looks smug) My lucky day.

(Azula runs over to the elevator winch and releases the break with a blast
of blue fire. The winch begins to spin rapidly as Azula grabs one of the
chains attached to the mechanism. The winch raises her rapidly toward the
top of the construction scaffolding.

Cut to Aang landing atop Bumi&#x27;s coffin as it continues its ascent.)

King Bumi: Aang, is that you? Where did you come from?
Aang: Hang on! We&#x27;re gonna get you out of here.

(The Avatar takes a deep breath and begins to blow on the chain connecting
the coffin to the crane, slowly freezing it.

Cut to Mai and Ty Lee charging Katara and Sokka. Several blades extend
from Mai&#x27;s right hand during a very short close up that is followed by a
shot of Katara and Sokka behind her watching the charge. Katara is in a
waterbending stance while Sokka blows on the bison whistle in the
background.)

Katara: We&#x27;ve got to get the baby out of here!
Sokka: (stopping his whistling to answer, a smile on his face) Way ahead
of ya!

(The baby grabs the whistle, then cut to an overhead shot of Katara and
Sokka running to the edge of the construction platform. Suddenly, a fist
punches Sokka&#x27;s foot as he passes from a hole in the floor. Sokka goes
sprawling to the edge of the platform, but lands on his back, protecting
the baby.

Cut to a shot behind Katara. She looks down the platform to Sokka and sees
Ty Lee vault out of a trap door in the floor and head towards Sokka and
the baby. She creates a water whip and prepares to strike Ty Lee, but
turns just in time to use the whip to raise up some wood from the floor to
block the blades that Mai has just thrown at her. The blades bury
themselves in the wooden planks. Katara then uses the whip to throw the
wood at Mai, then turns and catches Ty Lee&#x27;s ankle with it. Ty Lee falls
flat on the ground as Sokka climbs down a ladder with the baby. In the
background, Katara whips Mai away once again. Cut back to Sokka sliding
down the ladder and running off below with the baby.

Cut back to Bumi and Aang still being raised with the coffin and Aang
still blowing on the chain.)

King Bumi: Aang, stop your blowing for a minute.

(The chain is now encased in ice where it meets the coffin. In the
background, an explosion of dust announces the arrival of Princess Azula.
Cut to a wide shot of the coffin and the top of the construction
scaffolding to which it is now adjacent. Azula jumps high into the air
after having been carried up at high speed by the mechanical energy of the
winch below. The frame rate slows as she reaches the height of her arc.
The frame rate speeds up again as she unleashes a blast of blue fire from
her foot at Aang. Cut to a wide shot of Aang on top of the coffin as the
blast comes toward him. He partially deflects it with his staff, but the
chain holding the coffin breaks.)

King Bumi: Now hold on just a (the chain breaks and they fall) duahhh!!!

(Cut to a shot from near Azula&#x27;s head as she watches the coffin fall. Cut
to Aang atop the falling coffin. As they are about to hit one of Omashu&#x27;s
chutes, he creates a huge airball that deflects their fall. They land in
the chute and begin to ride down it.

Cut to Azula, watching from a perch high above. She scowls, jumps into a
nearby box, which falls into a nearby chute. Cut back to Aang surfing atop
Bumi&#x27;s coffin as it rockets down the chute.)

Aang: (smiling and laughing) Just like old times, isn\&#x27;t it, Bumi?
King Bumi: Aang, I need to talk to you!
Aang: (not understanding because of the noise) It&#x27;s good to see you too!

(Aang looks up to see Azula riding a box in a chute just above them. He
begins to twirl his staff rapidly to dissipate the blue fire bolts rapid
fired at them by the Princess. Their chutes merge and Azula is now behind
them. Aang launches a gale at her, but she parts it with her hands
steepled in front of her. She follows, launching more fire blasts at him.
Finally, they enter a portion of the chute that has arches over it at
short intervals. Aang blasts these with wind and they come tumbling down
on the chute between Azula and them. Cut to a profile of Azula riding atop
the box. She and the box disappear as they enter the dust cloud of the
fallen arches. The box emerges from the other side without Azula. Cut to
Aang who breathes a sigh of relief, but he screams as she stands up from
where she had been crouched in the box. She launches another blue blast of
fire, but Aang ducks and avoids it.

Cut back to a wide, overhead shot of Katara facing Mai on the construction
platform. Katara whips Mai, but misses as Mai leans back to avoid the
water. As she leans back, Mai launches another blade from her a device
around her ankle, but Katara blocks it with a wall of ice. Cut to Mai
charging Katara, her arms sweeping back behind her in a herring bone
formation. As she approaches, Katara encases Mai&#x27;s arm in water and
freezes it. Mai tries to break the ice with her free arm, but fails.

Ty Lee jumps up onto the platform and bounds toward Katara. She
systematically jabs various pressure points on Katara apparently causing
her whip to fall to the ground, useless, and the ice around Mai&#x27;s arm to
melt. Ty Lee jumps over to stand by Mai. Startled, Katara recovers and
assumes another stance. She tries to raise the water from the platform,
but very little happens. Cut to a frontal shot of Mai and Ty Lee, both
waiting for Katara to do something.)

Mai: (taunting) How are you gonna fight without your bending?

(Mai pulls out another blade from her robe, this one a three pointed
device that unfolds into a talon shaped throwing star. Katara gasps as Mia
gets ready to throw. As she does, Sokka\&#x27;s boomerang enters the frame from
behind Mai and knocks the star out of her hand.

Cut to Sokka atop Appa, who catches his boomerang.)

Sokka: I seem to manage!

(Sokka and Appa land between Katara and her would be killers. Appa&#x27;s tail
comes down is huge arc, smashing the platform in behind him, throwing Mai
and Ty Lee way back and making a huge hole in the floor.

Cut to Sokka and Katara now atop flying atop Appa. Katara looks to her
left and points.)

Katara: There&#x27;s Aang!
Sokka: We can catch him!

(Cut to a shot behind Katara and Sokka, the chute where Aang and Azula are
battling clearly visible below.

Cut back to Azula throwing blasts of blue fire ahead of her. Aang deflects
them with his staff as Appa and the others pull up alongside.)

Aang: Hang on, Bumi! Our ride&#x27;s here!

(Aang strikes the side of the chute with his staff, launching the coffin
out of the chute. Katara and Sokka try to grab the coffin as it passes
overhead, but they miss. The coffin sails over Appa and falls down the
other side. Bumi screams on the way down. Cut to a wide shot as they land
crosswise on another chute and break right through it. They fall through
to another chute, this time landing lengthwise and they begin to slide
down once more.

Azula continues to pursue them in her box. She creates a circular saw
blade of blue fire and launches it at the coffin. As it approaches, Bumi
strains in his bonds and causes a pillar of earth to rise up through the
chute just in time to absorb the blast. Azula jumps out of her box just as
it impacts on the pillar of earth. She slides to a halt in the chute,
looking displeased, then cut to her p.o.v. as she watches Aang and Bumi
slide away, then back to a close up of her displeased expression.

Meanwhile, Bumi&#x27;s coffin begins to plane out as it reaches the bottom of
the chute.)

Aang: You could earthbend all along!?
King Bumi: Well, they didn&#x27;t cover my face.

(Bumi strains again within his bonds, then cut to a shot of the end of the
chute. An outcropping of rock appears. The coffin hits it as it exits the
chute and ends up standing straight up on the newly raised rock. Aang now
looks up at Bumi in his coffin.)

Aang: I don&#x27;t understand. (Getting angry, the questions becoming rapid
fire) Why didn&#x27;t you free yourself? Why did you surrender when Omashu was
invaded? What&#x27;s the matter with you, Bumi!?
King Bumi: Listen to me, Aang. There are options in fighting, called jin.
It&#x27;s a choice of how you direct your energy.
Aang: I know! (holding up his fingers as he counts them off) There&#x27;s
positive jin when you&#x27;re attacking, and negative jin when you&#x27;re
retreating.
King Bumi: and neutral jin (the camera zooms to a close up of Bumi&#x27;s face)
when you do nothing!
Aang: (startled, looking at his hand which now has three fingers raised)
There three jins?
King Bumi: Well, technically there are eighty five. But, let&#x27;s just focus
on the third. Neutral jin is the key to earthbending. It involves
listening and waiting for the right moment to strike.

Aang: (with dawning understanding) That&#x27;s why you surrendered, isn&#x27;t it?
King Bumi: Yes, and it&#x27;s why I can&#x27;t leave now.

(Aang looks down and turns away, clearly sad and disappointed, Bumi in the
background.)

Aang: I guess I need to find someone else to teach me earthbending.
King Bumi: Your teacher will be someone who has mastered neutral jin. You
need to find someone who waits and listens before striking.

(Momo jumps onto Aang shoulder and chitters.)

Aang: Hey, Momo!
King Bumi: Momo&#x27;s mastered a few jins himself!

(Cut to a close up of Momo, who looks at Bumi and screams, the cut to
Bumi.)

King Bumi: Goodbye, Aang. I&#x27;ll see you when the time is right.

(Bumi leans back and his coffin tumbles back into the chute. Laughing
maniacally, Bumi uses his earthbending powers to drive his coffin back up
the chute.

Cut to a shot of Aang from the p.o.v. of the now empty chute. Behind him,
Appa and the others appear.

Cut again to a shot of Azula&#x27;s litter driving out of the city. Shift to a
closer shot of Azula sitting in her litter, partially obscured by the
litters veil, her friends walking at beside her.)

Mai: So, we&#x27;re tracking down your brother and Uncle, huh?
Ty Lee: (teasing) It&#x27;ll be interesting seeing Zuko again, won&#x27;t it, Mai?

(Mai turns sideways, looks at the camera, and smiles for a brief second
before looking ahead again.)
Azula: It&#x27;s not just Zuko and Iroh anymore. We have a third target now.

(Fade to Aang peeping over a balcony, then cut to the Governor holding his
wife on the patio below where Aang is hiding. It is night, or just past
dusk. Cut to a shot behind the Governor. Aang glides silently down from
above and releases the baby, who toddles over to his parents. Aang departs
as silently as he came. The baby is greeted with joy.)

Governor&#x27;s Wife: (gasping) Tom-Tom!

(Aang watches from the roof with a smile, then flies away. Fade to white.)

第三回
重返奥玛舒
怎么会这样，我知道战火正在四处蔓延，
可是奥玛舒一直都是...
...固若金汤
看来还是没能守住
恐怕现在土强国只剩下永固城一座城池了
我知道这真的很糟
但是我们还要继续走下去
不行，我得去找布米
安昂，且慢，我们甚至都不知道布米是否还...
怎样？还怎么样？
...还在这附近
我知道你一心想和布米学习御土术
不过御土术老师还有很多
我在意的并不是给自己找个老师
而是要找到我的朋友
有条秘密通道？上次来的时候咱们怎么不用呢？
这个回答你满意吗？
还好，没我想象的那么糟
怎么弄不掉它们啊？快来帮忙
别大吵大嚷的，只不过是紫色五角章鱼罢了
谁在那儿？
都过了宵禁了
你们这几个毛孩子还在外面瞎逛啥
抱歉，我们正往家赶呢
等等，那孩子怎么了？
那个...长官，他得了五角天花
呃...传染性很高的呢
呜~~太难受了....我要死了...
得了这病小命恐怕不保
等等，我好像听说过这个病
你那个叫常的表弟就是得这病死的吧
咱们回去赶紧把手洗洗...
要不然把衣服也烧了吧
谢谢你了
住在下水道里的朋友
追踪你的皇兄和皇叔的时候
最好不要再用皇家部队了
这样下去的话
很容易打草惊蛇的
说的没错，整个军队出击太过招摇了
我必须出奇制胜
我需要一支精锐的小分队
该是时候去会会老朋友了
找到布米，然后赶快离开这儿
他们会把他关在哪儿呢？
肯定是不能用御土术的地方
应该是金属做成的地方
我对这个地方的憎恨真有如滔滔江水连绵不绝
梅，你父亲刚刚被提为总督
咱们在这儿就相当于是土皇帝
开心点，要学会享受生活
目标正在接近
把他们给我干掉
原来以为烈火国就够无聊的
没想到这个地方更加无趣
居然啥事也没发生过
是抵抗军
泰丽，真的是你吗？
阿祖拉
能见到你真是太好了
希望我没有打扰你练...的那个啥
说实话，你一个贵族千金来这儿干嘛呢
父母当初送我们去烈火皇家女子学院
可不是为了让我们在这种地方安身立命啊
我有个提议
我正在抓捕一个叛徒
还记得我那个唠唠叨叨的邋遢皇叔吗？
哦，记得，他相当风趣了
你要是能加入我的队伍就太好了
哦...我...呃....倒是很愿意
但是你得知道，我现在在这儿很高兴
我的心情好久都没有这么爽了
既然你都这么说了
我怎么能为了让自己高兴而断送了你的幸福呢
我谢你啊，阿祖拉
对了，我走之前一定会去看你表演的
呃...耶...那当然...没问题
我说，布米王跟你们在一起吗？
是他领导着抵抗军吗？
他可不在这儿，就在敌人入侵的那一天
我们都在积极备战，誓死要守住城池
为了我们的生活和自由而战
可我们还没来不及动手呢
布米王就投降了
就在敌人入侵的那天
我去问布米王该怎么做
他看着我的眼睛，说...
我准备开城...投降
现在也无所谓了
为了自由我们要跟烈火国决一死战
为了自由，死也值得
实际上还有其他途径可以得到自由的
你们可以离开奥玛舒啊
现在你们虽然孤注一掷的对抗烈火国
可是现在的形式是敌众我寡，胜不了的
正所谓“留得青山在，不怕没柴烧”
你哪会知道，他们夺去了我们的家园
我们当然要殊死抗争
我觉得那句“留得青山在，不怕没柴烧”挺有道理的
没错，那孩子说得对
那好吧，不过要让这么多的人安然离开可不是易事
我们该怎么办呢？
山人自有妙计
（Sucker：吸盘）
看来大家这回该得个五角天花玩玩了
现在看起来是像病了
还得麻烦大家装出病态来
就看大家的演技了
看见没，这就是样板
闹呢，俺可是老戏古了
大家各就各位，进入得病形态
安昂，你去干嘛，不和我们一道吗？
不了，找到布米之前我是不会离开的
抱歉了模模，我回头再喂你
瘟疫！瘟疫！
到底发生什么事了？
昨天在巡逻的时候看到几个得五角天花的小孩
肯定是疾病已经扩散了
五角天花，我之前好像听过这种病
啊，简直太恐怖了
-我们该怎么办呢？
-赶紧把他们驱出城外...记住谁也别碰他们啊
我们得让这个病在城中断根
老爹，来点“烈焰玉米片”
真是太糟了
弗洛布西！
来吧，弗洛布西，帮我找到布米
驾，驾！
哦，看来这口令对你来说不管用
咱们走吧
烈火王的千金能够光临敝团，我们真是不胜荣幸啊
嗯，如果有什么可以为您效劳的，请尽管开口
我可不客气
真是太精彩了，她不会摔下来吧？
-当然不会了
-咱们把网撤了应该会更有趣吧
-你要知道，这个...这些演员...
-没错，没错，撤网对他们是小儿科
-我知道了，还是把网给我点着了吧
-遵命，公主殿下
精彩，真精彩！
对了，你这儿都有什么猛兽啊
-哦，我们团的有来自世界各地的珍禽异兽...
-把它们都放出来吧
我们到处都找遍了，就是没找到布米
我们刚清点了一下人数，出了点小问题
不是吧，还有人没出城
不是的，是多个一口人
这么说，抵抗军绑架了我儿子
他们真是阴险狡诈啊，就和他们的布米王一样
长官，我们该怎么做
你的表演真是太精彩了
我都迫不及待的想看你明天的演出了
对不起，阿祖拉，明天我不会表演了
真的吗？
上天启示我，说该是转职的时候了
我想加入你的小支队
住手！真是个坏火宗小孩
好了...给你玩吧
哦~~你真是太可爱了，亲一个
他现在是可爱，不过等他长大了
定会加入火宗军队的
他肯定会成为一个“可爱”的杀手
你见过有长得这么可爱的杀手吗？
是信鹰
是那个火宗总督写来的
他认为是咱们绑架了他的儿子
所以...他想做个交易
用他的儿子换布米王
你得清楚那可能是火宗设的一个套
不会的，相信那个总督一定很想要回他的儿子
就像咱们想要回布米一样
新的一天开始了，我有好的预感
如果你是来杀我的，我将不胜荣幸
梅，真是好久不见了
你不是离家出走，去了什么马戏团吗？
你还说，宿命在召唤你
可能是阿祖拉召唤的声音更大些吧
我现在有个任务，需要你俩的帮忙
算我一个吧，这鬼地方我多一天也不想待
请您恕罪
现在正是奥玛舒的多事之秋
就在中午我们要和抵抗军作笔交易，换回我的儿子汤汤
你儿子的事我深表遗憾
不过你怎么那么草率就放走了那些市民
我父皇放心把这个城池交给你
却让你治理成这副德性
请您恕罪，公主殿下
你留在这儿，人质交换的事就交给梅来办吧
省得再让你给搞砸了
哦对了，这儿再也没有什么奥玛舒了
为了表示对父皇的尊重，这儿就改叫“新欧宰城”吧
嗨，大家好啊
-把我弟弟带来了吗
-带来了，咱们开始交换吧
请恕我无理，我有个想法想说一下
请说，阿祖拉公主
我们要用一位君王来换个二岁孩童
这位君王可是个巨强的御术师
好像这个交易不太公平啊
你说得没错
交易取消了
哇噢！回见了您哪
布米
降世神通
今天点儿真幸啊！
安昂，是你吗？
你这是打哪来啊？
坚持住！我这就救你出来
咱们得赶紧把这孩子带走
交给我了
安昂，先别吹了
能不能先歇会儿...啊~~
布米，这就像原来一样啊，不是吗？
安昂，咱们得好好谈谈
我见到你也很高兴
看你用不出御术还怎么跟我打
别忘了还有我呢
-安昂在那儿
-咱们去接应他
坚持住，布米，咱们的援军来了
你一直都能用御土术？
当然了，好在他们没挡住我的脸
那我就不明白了，你为什么不逃出来呢
为什么当初奥玛舒遭到进攻的时候你要投降
布米，你吃错药了吗？
听我说，安昂
武学讲究一个“劲”字
就是说在战斗时要学会活用你的能量
这我知道，在进攻时要用“正劲”
在撤退时要用“负劲”
而在啥也不做时要善用“中劲”
一共有三种“劲”？
实际上，一共有八十五种劲
不过“中劲”是精华所在
善用“中劲”才能用好御土术
就是说在进攻时要善于观察局势、把握时机
这就是你投降的原因？
没错，所以我现在还不能离开
看来我得找其他人来教我御土术了
你要拜善于使用“中劲”的人为师
他必须是那种在进攻前审时度势，善于倾听的人
嘿，模模
模模可是自学了不少种“劲”哩
后会有期啊，安昂
时机到时我们自会相见
这么说，你正在追踪你的皇兄和皇叔喽
梅，你巴不得赶快见到祖寇了吧~
现在目标不仅仅是祖寇和艾洛了
我们还有第三个目标
汤汤
-=未完待续=-

水善国
土强国
火烈国
气和国
很久以前，这四大国和谐共处
然而，烈火国发起的战争结束了和平
只有同时掌握四种元素的降世神通才能结束战争
然而在大家最需要他的时候，他却消失了
年后，我和哥哥发现了转世的降世神通，
他是个御气师，名叫“安昂”
尽管他的御气术着实厉害
在拯救苍生之前，他要学的还有很多
但是我坚信
安昂 能拯救这个世界
-=降世神通=-
