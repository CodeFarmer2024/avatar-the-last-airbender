Scene I

(The episode begins with a night scene. A bird, one of the red hawk like
birds seen at the beginning of �The Spirit World, Part 1�, flies through
the moonless night sky and cries out. Cut to a shot of the upper reaches
of a Fire Nation fortress. The shot pans down to reveal several towers
connected by the walls of the fortress. All are manned and have fires
burning in them. Pan left to reveal Fire Nation ships in the water beyond
the fortress. Cut to a shot of several fierce looking archers, their faces
painted either for decoration, camouflage or both. They release volley
after volley of arrows which strike their archery range targets dead
center. Successive arrows split the one already occupying the bulls eye
right down the middle of its shaft. Shift to wide shot of the archers
which pans up to one of the fortress towers where two men stand side by
side watching the archers.)

Colonel Shinu: Absolutely not. The Yu Yan archers stay here. Your request
is denied Commander Zhao.
Zhao: Colonel Shinu, please reconsider. Their precision is legendary. The
Yu Yan can pin a fly to a tree from a hundred yards away � without killing
it. You&#x27;re wasting their talents using them as mere security guards.
Colonel Shinu: I can do whatever I want with their talents. They&#x27;re my
archers and what I say goes.
Zhao: But my search for the Avatar is �
Colonel Shinu: � Is nothing but a vanity project! We&#x27;re fighting a real
war here and I need every man I&#x27;ve got, Commander.
Zhao: But �
Colonel Shinu: That&#x27;s final! I don&#x27;t want to hear another word about it.

(Zhao grumbles, then cut to the red bird seen earlier swooping down into
the tower. It lands on Colonel Shinu&#x27;s outstretched arm. He unties a
message from its back and it flies away. Cut to a view of the Colonel that
shows Zhao behind him. The Colonel&#x27;s expression turns to horror as he
reads the message. Zhao approaches from behind and he hands the message to
Zhao.)

Zhao: News from Fire Lord Ozai? (Smiles.) It appears I&#x27;ve been promoted to
Admiral. My request is now an order.

(Colonel Shinu bows and exits. Cut to the archers firing again at their
targets, then cut back to Zhao looking over the railing of the tower at
the archers. The screen pans up and zooms in to reveal a figure in a blue
mask sitting atop the tower, listening, who then exits. Fade to a scene of
a hillside strewn with broken boulders. The dawn is approaching, but the
sky is cloudy so it is still quite dark. The screen pans down to reveal
the remnants of a decaying ghost town. A cough is heard, then cut to an
overhead shot of Sokka in his sleeping bag resting on Appa, Aang and
Katara are facing him. A fire burns in the background. They appear to be
inside an enclosed, temple like structure overlooking the decaying town
below and the hillside beyond. Cut to a close shot of Sokka coughing, Momo
playing around his head and Katara wiping his forehead with a wet cloth.)

Katara: This should bring your fever down.
Sokka (feverishly): You know what I love about Appa the most? His sense of
humor.
Katara: That&#x27;s nice. I&#x27;ll tell him.

(Cut to a wider shot as Appa grunts at Sokka in response.)

Sokka: Haha! Classic Appa.
Aang (walking over): How&#x27;s Sokka doing?
Katara: Not so good. Being out in that storm really did a number on him.

(Cut to Sokka shivering in his sleeping bag and snorting back his runny
nose. Cut back to Sokka&#x27;s p.o.v.)

Aang: I couldn&#x27;t find any ginger root for the tea, but I found a map.

(Aang produces a scroll. Cut to a side view of Aang, the mountains visible
in the backdrop, as he spreads out the scroll on the ground.)

Aang: There&#x27;s an herbalist institute on the top of that mountain. We could
probably find a cure for Sokka there.
Katara: Aang, he&#x27;s in no condition to travel. Sokka just needs more rest.
I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll be better by tomorrow.

(Katara begins to cough at this.)

Aang: Not you too!
Katara: Relax, it was just a little cough. I&#x27;m fine �

(She cuts herself off with more coughing. Cut back to Aang, shielding
himself from her violent coughing.)

Aang: That&#x27;s how Sokka started yesterday. Now look at him � he thinks he&#x27;s
an earthbender!
Sokka (swinging at something that isn&#x27;t there): Take that, you rock!
Aang: A few more hours and you&#x27;ll be talking nonsense too. (Getting up and
grabbing his staff.) I&#x27;m going to find some medicine.

(He opens his glider and walks to the edge of the temple. A huge flash of
lightning illuminates Aang and the exterior of the temple. He twirls his
glider shut and leans it against the wall of the temple.)

Aang: Uh, maybe it&#x27;s safer if I go on foot. (Cut back to Appa et al, Aang
continues from o.c.) Keep an eye on&#x27;em guys.

(Appa grunts in reply.)

Sokka (deliriously): Haha! You guys are killin&#x27; me!

(Aang turns and launches himself into the air, landing far down the hill
the temple sits on. Cut to p.o.v. form somewhere in the decayed town. Aang
zooms by at high speed, using his airbending to accelerate his running
speed. Cut to a shot of Zuko&#x27;s ship steaming through water with land
visible behind it. Cut again to Zuko standing over his Lieutenant&#x27;s
shoulder. They are both looking at something.)

Lieutenant Jee: We haven&#x27;t been able to pick up the Avatar&#x27;s trail since
the storm.

(Cut to a map of the world that they are both looking at. The position of
the Lieutenant&#x27;s hand and extended index finger indicate that they are
currently at the northwest extremity of the Earth Kingdom, close to the
eastern most extremity of the northern air nomad lands.)

Lieutenant Jee: But, if we continue heading northeast �

(The Lieutenant is cut off as the light is blocked by an enormous shadow.
Cut to wider view of the bridge where Iroh and some crewman are playing
Pai Sho on the right. Another Fire Navy ship, a massive hulking thing, is
passing them to starboard, headed the opposite direction. Everyone on
Zuko&#x27;s bridge stares at it.)

Zuko: What do they want?
Iroh (hopefully): Perhaps a sporting game of Pai Sho!

(Cut to a brief shot of Zuko&#x27;s ship resting alongside the much larger,
double-smoke stack Fire Nation vessel. Switch to a scroll being unrolled
to reveal a drawn figure of Aang and some writing in Asian calligraphy.
Cut to a shot behind the herald who is holding up the �wanted� poster.
Zuko is in front of him, looking sour.)

Herald: The hunt for the Avatar has been given prime importance. (He
lowers the scroll.) All information regarding the Avatar must be reported
directly to Admiral Zhao.
Iroh (making a move on the Pai Sho board): Zhao has been promoted? Well,
good for him!

(Iroh&#x27;s opponent looks chagrined at the move and slaps his face. Cut to
Zuko.)

Zuko (sullenly): I&#x27;ve got nothing to report to Zhao. Now get off my ship
and let us pass.
Herald: Admiral Zhao is not allowing ships in or out of this area.
Zuko (angrily): Off my ship!

(Cut to Iroh, with the Herald and his two guards behind him. They leave as
Iroh smiles.)

Iroh: Excellent! (He leans forward and gathers all the chips on the
table)ake the pot. But, you&#x27;re all improving. I&#x27;m certain you will win if
we play again.

Cut to Zuko looking out over the waves as Iroh and the men begin another
game in the background behind him. Cut to a view of a mountain path. The
screen pans right to reveal a Fire Nation lookout post, the switch to a
view inside the post. One of the lookouts is looking out with a telescope,
another is reading Aang&#x27;s wanted poster.)

Reading Lookout: Says here that the Avatar can create tornados and run
faster than the wind. Pretty amazing.
Telescope Lookout (looking back at his colleague): Ehh, that&#x27;s just a
bunch of Fire Lord propaganda. There&#x27;s no way that&#x27;s true.

(The telescope lookout returns to his instrument, where we cut to his
p.o.v. through the telescope. He has a view of three bends in the mountain
pass. In a flash a cloud of dust rockets through the bend farthest away,
then the next and finally past the lookout itself. The rush of wind and
dust is tremendous. The lookouts blink their eyes and then the telescope
lookout blows his horn to the sky. Pan up to the empty sky, quickly
replaced by an exterior shot of the abandoned temple where Appa et al are
resting. Cut to Sokka, still shaking feverishly in his sleeping bag.)

Sokka: Katara� please� water�

(Camera pans left to Katara, now obviously sick, resting on Appa too. Momo
stands in front of her.)

Katara: Listen carefully, Momo. I need you to take this to the river and
fill it with water.

(Katara has raised up the water bag around her neck, offering it to Momo.
Cut to a close of Momo&#x27;s expressive green eyes, which blink. He is trying
to understand her. He chitters. Cut to Momo&#x27;s p.o.v. He sees Katara making
walking motions with her fingers and hears her yammering at him in
gibberish. Cut back to Katara&#x27;s p.o.v, looking at Momo&#x27;s face.

Katara: Got it?

(Momo grabs the water skin and flies off. Cut to Aang huffing and puffing
as he runs at breakneck speed up the steps on the herbalist institute. He
reaches the top and runs into a circular wooden building. Cut to the
inside of the building which is filled with trees, bushes and flowers. An
old woman is in the background and a white fluffy cat is in the
foreground. Aang runs into the frame and cat meows and jumps out of the
way.)

Aang (speaking very fast): Hello! I&#x27;m sorry to barge in like this, but I
need some medicine for my friends. They have fevers and they&#x27;ve been
coughing and �
Herbalist (mixing something in a bowl on the table in front of her):
Settle down, young man. Your friends are going to be fine. (She walks over
to another table where the cat is sitting.) I&#x27;ve been up here for over
forty years you know, used to be others, but they all left years ago. (She
pets the cat who begins to purr.) Now it&#x27;s just me and Miyuki.
Aang: That&#x27;s nice.
Herbalist: Wounded Earth Kingdom troops still come by now and again, brave
boys, and thanks to my remedies they always leave in better shape they
when they arrive.
Aang: That&#x27;s nice. Are you almost done?
Herbalist: Hold on, I just need to add one last ingredient. (Walking
amongst the shrubbery, looking around and muttering to herself) Oh,
sandalwood�oh, er, uh, that won&#x27;t do, banana leaf? Ah, nope, uh, ginger
root, uh uh, oh where is that pesky little plant?

(Aang looks exasperated in the background. Cut to Zuko&#x27;s ship steaming by
the shore, the sunset in its last stages in the background. Cut to Zuko
practicing firebending on the foredeck in the background. Iroh&#x27;s arm comes
into the frame.)

Iroh: Is everything okay? It&#x27;s been almost an hour and you haven&#x27;t given
the men an order.
Zuko: I don&#x27;t care what they do. (Looks away out to sea.)
Iroh: Don&#x27;t give up hope yet. You can still find the Avatar before Zhao.
Zuko (turning back, desperation and fear on his face): How, Uncle? With
Zhao&#x27;s resources it&#x27;s just a matter of time before he captures the Avatar.
(Turns back out to sea and whispers) My honor, my throne, my country, I&#x27;m
about to lose them all.

(Cut back to an exterior shot of the herbalist institute, then a shot of
the old woman from the p.o.v. of some bushes she is looking at.)

Herbalist: Here&#x27;s what I was looking for! Plum blossom!

(She grabs one, then cut to Aang, his head on the table were Miyuki sits.
He gets up.)

Aang: Finally!

(Cut to Aang grabbing the bowl from the woman&#x27;s hands, then zoom backwards
to show Aang and the Herbalist.)

Aang: Thanks for all your help!
Herbalist (hitting Aang on the wrist and knocking loose his grip on the
bowl): Hands off! What do you think you&#x27;re doing?
Aang (looking frightened and abashed): Taking the cure to my friends!
Herbalist: Ahaha! This isn&#x27;t a cure, it&#x27;s Miyuki&#x27;s dinner.

(The Herbalist places the bowl on the table in front of Miyuki. She pets
the cat who begins to eat and purr.)

Herbalist: Plum blossom is her favorite.
Aang: What about my friends?
Herbalist: Well, all they need is some frozen wood frogs. There&#x27;s plenty
of them down in the valley swamp.
Aang: What am I supposed to do with frozen frogs?
Herbalist: Why, suck on them of course!
Aang (shocked): Suck on them!?
Herbalist: The frog&#x27;s skin excretes a substance that&#x27;ll cure your friends,
but make sure you get plenty. Once those little critters thaw out, they&#x27;re
useless!

(Cut to a wide shot of the two and space that separates them. A few
moments pass in silence.)

Aang: You&#x27;re insane aren&#x27;t you?
Herbalist: Thaaat&#x27;s right. (She turns back to her work, then turns back to
Aang.) Well, don&#x27;t stand there all day. (She whips her spoon at Aang, who
ends up with a bunch of black gunk on his face.) Go!

(Cut to Aang running out of the building, wiping his face. Suddenly arrows
fly through the air at him. Two land to his immediate right and left. As
Aang looks around, cut to a wide shot of the field Aang stands in. Above,
a huge number of arrows arch toward him at a reduced frame rate. Cut back
to an overhead shot of Aang as the arrows enter the shot from the sides of
the screen. Aang airbends a shell of wind around him knocking all the
arrows aside. Aang pulls one of the arrows out of the ground and offers it
to someone o.c.)

Aang: Uhh, I think you dropped this.

(Cut to a panning shot of the Yu Yan archers in the surrounding trees,
then a cut back to Aang&#x27;s frightened face. Cut to commercial break.)

Scene II

(When the show returns, Aang is struggling to pull an arrow out of the
ground that is holding his foot in place. He releases it just in time as
the archers fire another volley. He runs out of the way as two groups of
four arrows each plow into the ground near him as he runs o.c. He runs
towards the gate he entered through, but it is blocked by archers. They
fire, but he dodges and runs in the opposite direction. Dodging hails of
arrows, he jumps off the cliff at the back of the institute. Cut to Aang
hurtling down the cliff. Up above, the archers jump off the cliff after
him. Cut to side view of Aang falling with the cliff face on his left. He
lets his hood billow a bit to slow him down until he hits the tree canopy
beneath. Aang&#x27;s face gets beaten repeatedly by the brush rapidly flying
by. Cut to the archers who fire in mid flight, sending anchor ropes into
the nearby trees as they fall so they can swing tarzan-like after Aang.
Several shots are shown in quick succession as Aang is pursued from tree
branch to tree branch by the archers. Eventually Aang comes out of the
forest in the swamp. He lands in the water and emerges with a white,
frozen frog.)

Aang: A frog!

(The frog is knocked out of his hand by an arrow. He stands up and tries
to run through the water, looking for frogs along the way. Arrows fall all
around. He gets to a log rising out of the water, and an arrow pins his
right arm to it. It is soon joined by several more. The archers fire
another volley, but Aang waterbends a wall of ice in front of him. The
arrows shatter the ice. They fire another volley, pinning his left arm,
followed by a net that covers his upper body. Close of Aang&#x27;s face in
terror. Fade to a close up of Aang&#x27;s upper body, his arms stretched out,
his face downcast. The room is dark, but there is fire in the room that
sheds some illumination. Aang&#x27;s raised eyes of defiance as the screen
fades to a wider shot. Aang is a prisoner in a large room with two stone
pillars that have fires on their crests. Aang is shackled to them from his
arms. Fade to a shot of the guards outside his room, then fade and zoom
out to show exterior shots of the fortress in which he is being held. It
looks impregnable. Rank upon rank of walls, gates and towers. Cut back to
the prison chamber, where Aang struggles against his bonds. The door opens
and Aang looks up. Cut to a view from the doorway. Zhao walks into the
room towards Aang, hands behind his back.)

Zhao: So this is the great Avatar? Master of all the elements. I don&#x27;t
know how you&#x27;ve managed to elude the Fire Nation for a hundred years, but
your little game of hide and seek is over.
Aang: I&#x27;ve never hidden from you. Untie me and I&#x27;ll fight you right now!
Zhao: Uhh, no. Tell me, how does it feel to be the only airbender left?
(Putting his face up to Aang&#x27;s.) Do you miss your people? (Aang&#x27;s look of
defiance melts and he drops his head.) Oh, don&#x27;t worry, you won&#x27;t be
killed like they were. (Aang looks up again in anger.) See, if you die
you&#x27;ll just be reborn and the Fire Nation will have to being its search
for the Avatar all over again. So, I&#x27;ll keep you alive � but just barely.

(Zhao turns to leave, still smirking. Aang blows a gale force wind,
knocking Zhao until into the wall where he collapses in a heap. He shakes
his head to clear his vision and stands up.)

Zhao: Blow all the wind you want! Your situation is futile. There is no
escaping this fortress � and no one is coming to rescue you.

(Exit Zhao, the door slamming behind him. Cut to Katara and Sokka snuggled
up in their sleeping bags which lie between Appa&#x27;s feet. Sokka has a
coughing fit.)

Sokka: Water�
Katara: Momo should be back any minute.

(Momo jumps into the shot, chittering happily. He jumps up close to
Katara. He drops a dead mouse on to her chest. She looks at it in
disgust.)

Katara: Ugh! No, Momo, water. Wa-ter! (Momo&#x27;s ear go straight u. He then
jumps off her and scampers o.c.) Aang, what in the world is taking you so
long?

(Cut to an overhead shot of Aang still bound between the pillars, then cut
to several exterior night shots of the fortress, culminating in a long
shot of the figure in the blue mask. The camera zooms in three step
changes to a close up of the blue masked face which then moves left o.c.
Cut to a view of the road leading to the fortress where a wagon is making
its way toward the gate. Cut to a view of the undercarriage of the wagon
as it passes. The Blue Spirit is holding on to the underside of the wagon.
The wagon reaches the gate.)

Guard: All clear.

(A gate guard looks at the wagon and walks around it. When the guard
checks the undercarriage, the Blue Spirit is gone. The guard gets back up.
Cut to a wider shot of the wagon and the guards around it.)

Guard: All clear. Go on in.

(Shift to a view from inside the wagon where the Blue Spirit has hidden
himself, then cut to an overhead shot of the wagon as it enters the first
of the fortress&#x27; three gates. The shot pans up to rest on the massive
central tower where Aang is held prisoner. Cut to a view of the first
courtyard where the boxes in the wagon have been unloaded. The Blue Spirit
runs from them and ducks into the shadows. Cut to a shot of an ornate
balcony with bonfire pots on either side. The balcony is festooned with
gold and red spades. Admiral Zhao appears in ceremonial dress flanked by
attendants. During his speech the view cuts to show the innermost
courtyard full of fire nation soldiers standing at attention.)

Zhao: We are the sons and daughters of fire! The superior element! Until
today, only one thing stood in our path to victory. The Avatar! I am here
to tell you that he is now my prisoner! (The soldier&#x27;s cheer three times.)
This is the year Sozen&#x27;s comet returns to grant us its power! (Another
cheer is heard.) This is the year the Fire Nation breaks through the walls
of Ba-Sing-Se and burns the city to the ground!

(As Zhao speaks, various shots are seen of the Blue Spirit steadily and
stealthily infiltrating the fortress. Cut back to Aang, still struggling
fruitlessly against his chains. He finally stops, breathing heavily.
Suddenly, frogs start leaping out of his shirt and hood.)

Aang: What? No! Don&#x27;t leave frogs! My friends are sick and they need you!
Please go back to being frozen!

(He begins to struggle again as the frogs hop away towards the door. Cut
to the four guards standing outside the chamber. They begin to look
confused when they frog noises. They look down to see a few frogs coming
from underneath the door. Suddenly they look up as a Fire Nation soldier&#x27;s
helmet comes bouncing down the corridor towards them. One of the guard
walks up the corridor and turns right at the first junction, disappearing
from view. A gout of flame erupts from the cross hallway as well as the
sound of a brief scuffle. Two more guards go up to the junction and turn
right, firebending stances at the ready. Cut to a view looking down the
cross hallway. The first guard who went is hanging from the ceiling, tied
up. Shift to the hanging soldier&#x27;s p.o.v. and pan up to reveal the Blue
Spirit on the ceiling above the two new combatants. He drops down and
melee begins, but it is over quickly. Cut back last guards p.o.v. where he
now sees the Blue Spirit at the junction. Cut to a view of the door to
Aang&#x27;s chamber. The lone guard grabs the alarm horn next to him, but a
knife throw from o.c. knocks it out of his hand. The guard lets loose a
gout of flame at the Blue Spirit as he runs down the hall toward the door,
but the intruder extinguishes the blast with a bucket of water. The masked
figure then sweeps the guards feet out from under him with the empty
bucket. Cut to Aang still struggling inside the chamber. He stops and
looks at the noises of violence coming from through door. These stop
abruptly and replaced by the sound of the lock turning in the door. The
door opens and the Blue Spirit enters. He brandishes two curved swords and
runs forward to Aang, who screams in fear. Cut to commercial break.)

Scene III

(When the show returns, we see a zooming close up of the prison keep in
the center of the fortress. Cut to Aang, still screaming. The Blue Spirit
approaches and two sword cuts are heard. Aang pulls his arms back in
surprise � the Blue Spirit has freed him. He looks at his liberator in
wonder. The Blue Spirit comes closer and cuts his remaining bonds, turns
and walks back toward the door.)

Aang: Who are you? What&#x27;s going on? Are you here to rescue me? (The Blue
Spirit opens the door and motions for him to follow.) I&#x27;ll take that as a
�yes.�

(Aang follows him out past the gagged and tied guard at the door to his
chamber. He hears frog noises and turns to see his frogs on the floor.)

Aang: My frogs! Come back! And stop thawing out! (The Blue Spirit comes
back, picks him up by the collar and carries him out. He continues from
o.c.) Wait! My friends need to suck on those frogs!

(Meanwhile, back at the run-down temple, Momo has succeeded in piling up
mountains of junk around Katara, but no water. Momo returns again with
another trinket.)

Katara (with a weak, sickly voice): How many times do I have to tell you,
Momo, we need water. Wa-ter. Oh forget it. Aang, please, hurry.
Sokka (delirious): Who&#x27;s this �Aang� kid you keep talking about, Your
Highness?

(Cut back to an obviously annoyed Katara, her right eyebrow twitching.
Scene shifts back to a few exterior shots of the fortress, then to Aang
and the Blue Spirit walking silently in the sewer system underneath the
fortress. Soldiers walk back and forth above them. They hope out of a
grate and into one of the courtyards. Cut to Zhao walking in one of the
torch-lit corridors of the fortress, followed by some sort of scribe.)

Zhao: I want a full transcription of my speech sent to the Fire Lord,
along with glowing testimonials from all of the ranking officers present,
and �

(He cuts himself off as he hears moans. Cut to Zhao&#x27;s right, where the
soldiers that the Blue Spirit tied still lie. Zhao, upset, slams open the
door to Aang&#x27;s prison cell. It is empty, except for a frog which �ribbits�
at him from the floor. Zhao turns in anger and leaves, the scribe in tow.)

Scribe: Sir, should I hold off sending that speech to the Fire Lord?

(Cut back to the two would-be escapees who are now scaling a rope on the
innermost wall of the fortress. They are spotted and the view zooms out as
one of the guards shouts.)

Soldier: There, on the wall!

(A soldier appears at the top of the wall they are climbing. He cuts the
rope and the pair fall down the wall, Aang screaming. Cut to side view
where Aang airbends them to a soft landing. When the dust clears, the Blue
Spirit unsheathes his swords and they run. Cut to Zhao on the ornate
balcony.)

Zhao (shouting): The Avatar has escaped! Close all the gates immediately!

(Cut to the escapees running, Aang passes the Blue Spirit.)

Aang: Stay close to me!

(The third gate is closing in front of them, as are the two beyond it, and
it is blocked by many soldiers. Aang airbends a blast of air that blows
them out of the way. Aang makes the gate, but the Blue Spirit gets
involved in melee and has to stop. Aang turns to see his liberator in
trouble. He grabs a spear from a guard near him, airbends him out of the
way, breaks the head off the spear and launches back into battle to save
his new friend. The gate closes behind him. The Blue Spirit is surrounded,
but Aang airbends them all out of the way. With a mighty effort he then
catapults his liberator to the top of the third wall. He is instantly
surrounded, but Aang appears using his staff as a helicopter blade. He
plucks the Blue Spirit off the wall and heads into the next courtyard. Cut
to a close up of Aang struggling to keep them aloft. The Blue Spirit uses
his swords to knock the spears sent up at them by the guards. They barely
next the top of the next wall as they crash unceremoniously onto the
battlement. Aang&#x27;s staff goes spinning away as guards instantly rush them.
Aang runs for his staff, but a guard stops him, taking several swings at
Aang with his sword. The Blue Spirit throws the guard over the wall. Aang
then airbends the other guards off the wall. Cut to a wide shot of the
second wall, where more soldiers are brings scaling ladders. Aang the Blue
Spirit knock off the soldiers as they reach the top. With two mighty
blasts, Aang depopulates the two scaling ladders nearest him as the Blue
Spirit knocks the one final soldier off his. Aang brings over his two
scaling ladders and steps onto the one his liberator has just emptied. He
hands one ladder to the masked man.)

Aang: Here, take this. Jump on my back!

(The Blue Spirit complies and Aang begins to use the ladders as massive
stilts, shedding one each time a step is taken. Cut to a wide shot of the
second courtyard where dawn is approaching in the background. The first
ladder shed still had some Fire Nation soldiers on it, but it falls in the
dust.)

Aang: Gimme the next one!

(The Blue Spirit again complies. Cut to the bottom of their final stilt
where a Fire Nation soldier sends a gout of flame up the ladder. It is too
late though, as Aang and the masked man jump from the last stilt and just
manage to grab the edge of the final wall. They are unable to hold on,
however, and fall to the ground. The Blue Spirit draws his swords. Four
firebenders unleash their flame on them, but Aang puts the masked man
behind him and airbends the flames away.)

Zhao (initially from o.c.): Hold your fire! (Cut to Zhao) the Avatar must
be captured alive!

(The Blue Spirit instantly comes up behind Aang and crosses his swords in
front of Aang&#x27;s throat. Cut to a view behind the escapees that pans right
slowly, accenting the stand off, then cut to the implacable blue mask of
the intruder. Cut back to a close of Zhao&#x27;s eyes.)

Zhao (through gritted teeth): Open the gate.
Officer: Admiral, what are you doing?
Zhao: Let them out, now!

(The gate is opened and the Blue Spirit backs out with his captives,
swords still at his throat. Cut back to Zhao, the officer questioning him
still visible over his left shoulder.)

Officer: How could you let them go?
Zhao: A situation like this requires� precision.

(The Blue Spirit continues backing away from the fortress. Zhao now looks
on from the top of the main gate. Cut to an arrow being strung on a bow by
an unseen soldier, then cut back to Zhao, who looks to his right as he
speaks.)

Zhao: Do you have a clear shot?

(Cut to a Yu Yan archer, who doesn&#x27;t respond, but lowers his head in
preparation for his shot.)

Zhao: Knock out the thief. I&#x27;ll deliver him to the Fire Lord along with
the Avatar.

(The archer releases his arrow, which the camera follows across the field
to its impact point on the Blue Spirits masks. Cut to a side view of Aang
and the Blue Spirit as the masked man collapses backward in slow motion.
Aang turns in horror, his eyes glazed. He recovers, turns around and
airbends up a huge cloud of dust around him and the Blue Spirit. Cut to
Zhao.)

Zhao: Quick! Recover the Avatar!

(Cut to the main gate opening and a crowd Fire Nation soldiers emerging
and running towards the dust cloud. Cut to inside the dust cloud, where
Aang removes the Blue Spirit&#x27;s mask to reveal Prince Zuko. Aang starts
back in horror, he falls backward on the ground. He jumps up and runs
away, but then turns to look at Zuko, his eyes huge and full of
compassion. He sees the Fire Nation shoulders getting close through the
smoke. Still, he hesitates. When the dust clears, however, the soldiers
find nothing. The crossroad where Zuko had fallen is now empty. Cut back
to Zhao looking insanely angry. A frog hops up onto the railing,
�ribbits�, and hops off. Fade to white, then a blurry shot of a forest
looking straight up into the canopy overhead. It is morning. The screen
pans down to Aang sitting on a nearby root, the view is still blurry. He
looks forlorn. Cut to Zuko, whose view we were clearly just seeing. He
looks a bit dazed still.)

Aang (from o.c. at first): You know what the worst part about being born
over a hundred years ago is? I miss all the friends I used to hang out
with. Before the war started (cut to Aang still looking down at the
ground), I used to always my friend Kuzan. The two of us, we&#x27;d get in and
out of so much trouble together. He was one of the best friends I ever had
(he turns to face Zuko) � and he was from the Fire Nation, just like you.
(Cut back to Zuko still looking at Aang.) If we knew each other back then
(cut back to Aang), do you think we could have been friends too?

(Cut to a wide shot of Zuko lying on a bank of earth, Aang next to him,
perched a large tree root. After a pause, Zuko lets loose a huge gout of
flame at him, but Aang dodges and flies away on a current of air. Zuko
watches him hop away from tree branch to tree branch and out sight. Cut to
Zuko as the camera slowly zooms backward. Fade to a close up of the swamp,
where Aang is collecting frozen frogs once again. Cut back to a wide shot
of Zuko&#x27;s ship reeling in the cutter vessel back into the mother ship.
Shift to Zuko, sullen, walking past his Uncle on the main deck. He has
been practicing with the sumki horn he bought in �The Waterbending
Scroll.�)

Iroh: Where have you been, Prince Zuko? You missed music night! Lieutenant
Jee sang a stirring love song.
Zuko (walking away): I&#x27;m going to bed. No disturbances.

(Iroh rubs his head and begins to blow his horn again, echoing the same
sad dirge that has been playing for much of the episode. Fade back to the
run down temple. Aang returns, downcast. He puts frogs in his friends&#x27;
mouths.)

Aang: Suck on these. They&#x27;ll make you feel better.

(Aang collapse backwards onto Appa&#x27;s beaver like tail with a sigh. Cut to
Sokka with a frog in his mouth.)

Sokka (speech impaired by the amphibian oral obstruction): Aang, how was
your trip? Did you make any new friends?
Aang: No, I don&#x27;t think I did.

(Aang rolls over. Fade to Prince Zuko lying awake in his own chamber, lost
in thought. He looks at the Fire Nation symbol hanging on his wall, then
rolls over himself. Cut back to the temple and then to Sokka, a happy
expression on his, still sucking on the frog in his mouth.)

Sokka: Mmmm! This is tasty! Mmm!

(It thaws out and begins moving around and croaking. Sokka realize what it
is and spits it out in disgust. Cut to Katara, her frog has also thawed.
She cries out and it hops out of her mouth. Both Katara and Sokka begin
spitting and coughing. Fade to white.)

看来我被提升了，还高你一级
我的请求现在已经变成命令了
这个应该能帮你退烧
你知道我喜欢阿柏哪点吗？
它的幽默感
是吗？我会帮你转达的
嗯，嗯，经典啊，阿柏
索卡怎么样了？
不怎么样，看来那场暴风把他的小身板弄垮了
没能找到姜根给他泡茶，但是我找到了一张地图
对面山顶有座药草学堂
也许咱们能给他找点药吃吃
安昂，他现在的状态不易飞行
索卡只是需要休息，他明天一定会好起来的
-不是吧，你怎么也...
-我没事
小感冒而已，没关系啦
索卡昨天看起来也是得了小感冒
瞧他现在，竟然认为自己是个御土师
接招吧，石头
过不了几个小时，你也该说胡话了。我去讨些药来
啊~~~~
嗯，还是步行去比较安全
伙计们，照顾好索卡
哈哈！你们这帮家伙太搞乐了
在暴风之后我们就失去了降世神通的踪迹
但是，如果我们继续向东北航行的话...
他们想干嘛？
看能想跟我下盘“牌首”棋吧
（Pai Sho: 音译, 拍手棋??呵呵. 之前几集均有出现, 现拟译成&quot;牌首&quot;）
降世神通的追捕已被列为首要任务
所有关于降世神通的消息必须第一时间向赵大将军通报
赵又升官了? 不错嘛
告诉赵，我没什么要跟他通报的
你赶紧从我们的船上滚下去，让我们通行
赵大将军禁止船只在这里通行
滚！
太好了
胡了
（ake the pot 不知有什么典故）
不过你们（你）也有进步，下次玩的时候你们没准能赢
（艾洛总是话里有话，其实暗里在夸奖祖寇的成长.
深藏不露的老者，艾洛，我看好你哟~）
这上面说神通能”制起旋风，且飞遁如风”
好厉害啊
嗯，只不过是烈火君危言耸听罢了，你还真信哪？
卡塔拉，拜托了，给我点水
模模，仔细听我说
现在需要你去河边，用这个装满水带回来
明白了吗？
你好！很抱歉打扰您，不过我急需给朋友求点草药
他们发烧、咳嗽，还...
年轻人，别着急，你的朋友会没事的
老身在这儿都待了多年了
原来这儿还有其他人，几年前他们都搬走了
只剩下我和“咪奇”
是嘛
受伤的土强国士兵偶尔还回到我这来看病，
这帮勇敢的小伙子，多亏了我给他们治疗
他们每次都是伤着进来，健康的离去
你好厉害，您差不多做好了吧？
别着急，还得往里面加最后一味药
是加檀香木？...这个...好像不对...
要不就是香蕉叶？啊，不对，姜根...嗯...
哦，那个讨厌的小植物跑哪去了？
你还好吗？
都半个时辰了，你还没给船员们下过一条命令呢
他们想干嘛 就干嘛吧
不要这么快就放弃了，你仍然可以在赵之前抓到神通
皇叔，怎么抓？
您说得简单，赵以他的人力，抓住神通只是个时间问题
我的尊严，我的王位，我的天下，全都要失去了
终于找到你了
梅花
总算弄完了
多谢您的帮忙
把手拿开
你要干嘛？
拿去给我的朋友治病啊
哎哟，这不是药，是“咪奇”的晚餐
梅花是它的最爱
那我朋友的病该咋治啊？
那个，给他们弄点“冰蟾蜍”就行
在山谷的沼泽里到处可见
那...冰蟾蜍该怎么用？
这还用问？当然是含在嘴里吸他们咯
吸他们？
它们的皮肤会分泌一种物质，可以治好你的朋友
（提醒电视机前，实际生活中蟾蜍可不能吸啊，有毒！）
一次多抓点，一旦这些小家伙解冻了，它们就没用了
你有神经病吧？
没错啊
（汗|||）
还站在这儿干吗？马上就去~
嗯，我想你们好像掉了东西
冰蟾蜍！
这不就是伟大的降世神通吗？
掌握着四大元素的精华
真不知道，年前你是怎么躲过火宗的追杀的
不过，很不幸的通知您，你那躲迷藏的游戏...
已经结束了
我从来都没有躲过你
放开我，有种就跟我担挑
嗯....没门
我说
作为仅存的气宗人有何感想啊
想你的子民们吗？
别担心
他们是死了，可我不会杀了你的，
如果你死了，肯定又会重生
烈火国就又要费尽巴拉的重新找你
所以，我就留你一命
留口气就行
想吹风你就吹个够吧
你已经无力回天了
你是跑不出这个堡垒的
当然，也不会有人来救你
水~
模模一会就会回来的
嗯，不对，模模，是水
sh-ui，水
安昂，你怎么还不回来啊？
没问题
没问题，进去吧
我们是烈火的后代，火是最优秀的元素
直至今天
阻挡我们胜利的只有一人
他就是降世神通
今天，我在这里向大家宣告，
神通现在已经是我们的阶下囚了
今年“孙赞”的彗星又将回归
（Sonzen&#x27;s comet，根据第三季的线索Sonzen为苏进，
祖寇的曾祖父，也难怪祖寇又有一种叫法为“苏科”了 ）
它将给予我们力量
今年烈火国将踏破“永固城”的城墙
将它夷为平地
不要啊，别走啊，蟾蜍，我的朋友们病了，
他们需要你们，乖乖回来冻着
你是谁？
你要干嘛？要救我出去？
你不说就当你默许了
我的蟾蜍！快回来，别解冻了
等等，我的朋友需要吸这些蟾蜍
模模，我都告诉你多少遍了
我们需要水
sh-ui，三声，水
噢，算了吧
安昂，拜托了，快点回来
殿下，您刚才一直提到的那个
叫“安昂”的小孩到底是谁啊？
把我的演讲记下来发给烈火王
别忘了注上在座高官的强烈反响，还有...
长官，我是不是应该晚点再将演讲发给烈火王
看那，在墙上
降世神通逃跑了！
赶快把大门都关上
跟紧我
来，抓住这个
跳到我背上来
把另一根给我
住手
降世神通必须要抓活的
打开大门
长官，你这是要干嘛？
让他们出去，马上
你怎么能放他们走？
这种情形下，需要...
...精准
视野清晰吗？
把那个小贼敲晕
到时候把他连同神通一起交送给烈火王
快！把神通给我抓回来
你知道出生在年前最遭的是什么吗？
我非常想念以前一起玩耍的同伴
战争发生以前
我经常和我的好友“酷赞”一起玩
我们两个形影不离，闯了不少祸呢
他是我最好的朋友
虽然他是火国人
就像你一样
如果回到过去，你我相识，咱们也会成为好朋友吗？
祖寇殿下，你去哪了？
你都错过音乐晚会了
吉上尉唱的那首情歌老煽情了
我要去睡了
别打搅我
（海盗船上的那个石猴子果然被他弄来了）
快吸它们
吸完了你们就会好了
安昂，此行收获如何？有没有结交新朋友啊？
嗯，好像没有
嗯，还挺好吃的呢。嗯~
-=未完待续=-

水善国
土强国
火烈国
气和国
很久以前，这四大国和谐共处
然而，烈火国发起的战争结束了和平
只有同时掌握四种元素的降世神通才能结束战争
然而在大家最需要他的时候，他却消失了
年后，我和哥哥发现了转世的降世神通，
他是个御气师，名叫“安昂”
尽管他的御气术着实厉害
在拯救苍生之前，他要学的还有很多
但是我坚信
安昂 能拯救这个世界

-=降世神通=-
