The King of Omashu

Written By: John O&#x27;Bryan
Directed By: Anthony Lioi
Storyboard By: Ian Graham, Anthony Lioi, and Bobby Rubio
Animation By: DR Movie
Transcriber: Acastus

Scene I

(Scene opens with a shot of partially snow covered ground. The shot pans
up to reveal the Katara, Aang, Sokka and Appa mounting the crest of a
small hill. Aang smiles and spreads his arms wide.)

Aang: The Earth Kingdom city of Omashu!

(Cut during Aang&#x27;s statement to a wide shot of the valley in front of
them. A walled city rests atop a huge rock promontory and is accessible
only by a narrow, switchback road. The city looks both impressive and
impregnable. Cut back to the group.)

Aang: I used to always come here to visit my friend, Bumi.
Katara: Wow. We don&#x27;t have cities like this in the South Pole.
Sokka (in amazement): They have buildings here that don&#x27;t melt!
Aang: Well, let&#x27;s go slow pokes! The real fun is inside the city!

(Aang launches himself into the air and lands farther down the hill.)

Katara: Wait, Aang! It could be dangerous if people find out you&#x27;re the
Avatar.
Sokka: You need a disguise.
Aang: So, what am I supposed to do? Grow a mustache?

(Cut to Aang wearing a huge fake head of hair and mustache made out of
some of Appa&#x27;s hair. He is scratching underneath the wig.)

Aang: Ohh, this is so itchy! (To Appa) How do you live in this stuff?
(Appa grunts at him in response.)
Sokka: Great! Now you look just like my grandfather.
Katara: Technically, Aang is 112 years old.
Aang (picking up his staff and using a fake, old man voice): Now let&#x27;s get
to skippin&#x27;, young whippersnappers! The big city awaits.

(Aang begins to walk hunched over, using his staff as a walking stick.
Fade to a shot sometime later of the three walking up the access road.)

Aang: You guys are gonna love Omashu. The people here are the friendliest
in the world.

(From o.c. a rough voice is heard. The three stop short at the sound, and
the shot cuts a moment later to a view of the city gate just up ahead. A
merchant is trying to get into the city, but the three guards are giving
him trouble.)

Gate Guard: Rotten cabbages! What kind of slum do you think this is?

(Cut to a closer shot of the guards and the merchant. The guard is holding
one of the offending cabbages. He crushes the cabbage in his hand, knocks
those in the merchant&#x27;s arms over the side of the access road. The guard
then earthbends a lump of the ground, knocking the merchant&#x27;s cabbage cart
high into the air and over the side of the access road. The cart and all
the merchant&#x27;s cabbages plunge hundreds of feet to the valley floor
below.)

Cabbage Merchant: Noo! My cabbages!

(The merchant looks over the side of the road as he laments. The camera
pans left to our group as they look over as well. Cut to the three now
looking ahead to the gate with some trepidation.)

Aang: Just keep smiling�

(Aang walks forward with a big smile. Katara titters uneasily, but she and
Sokka follow. The guard who has just obliterated the cart walks forward to
meet Aang. He earthbends a huge boulder out of the ground and holds it
over Aang&#x27;s head.)

Gate Guard: State your business!

(Aang rushes forward out from under the rock in a move much too sprightly
for his supposed age. He points an accusing finger at the guard and using
his old man voice begins to speak.)

Aang: My business is my business, young man, and none of yours! I&#x27;ve got
half a mind to bend you over my knee and paddle your backside!

(The guard drops the stone behind Aang in surprise. Cut to view of Katara
and Sokka, both terrified at what Aang is doing.)

Gate Guard: Settle down, old timer. Just tell me who you are.
Aang: Name&#x27;s Bonzu Pipinpadaloxicopolis, the Third, and these are my
grandkids.
Katara (now smiling serenely): Hi, June Pipinpadaloxicopolis. Nice to meet
you.
Gate Guard (pointing to Katara): You seem like a responsible young lady.
See that your grandfather stays out of trouble. Enjoy Omashu!
Katara: We will.

(The guard motions them to pass. The three walk forward into the city with
Sokka trailing.)

Gate Guard: Wait a minute! (He grabs Sokka by the shoulder just after he
passes.) You&#x27;re a strong young boy. Show some respect for the elderly and
carry your grandfather&#x27;s bag.
Aang: Good idea!

(Aang throws bag to Sokka. Cut to a rear shot of the three at the gate,
which is stone and consists of three movable, interlocking stone walls.
The three are shocked by the size and power of this fortification. The
gates begin to close again as the three move to pass through it. Just as
his vision of Aang is obscured, the guard sees Momo&#x27;s ears emerge from
Aang&#x27;s wig. Cut to a shot of three inside the gate and looking over a
railing at the interior of the city. The shot pans up to reveal many
houses with roofs painted in Earth Kingdom green. There are chutes all
over the city with crates and packages sliding along them. While Aang is
speaking, the view cuts to images of earthbenders working the delivery
system as Aang explains the mechanics of the system to Katara and Sokka
o.c.)

Aang: This is the Omashu delivery system. Miles and miles of tubes and
chutes. Earthbending brings the packages up and gravity brings them down.
(Cut back to the group.)
Sokka: Great, so they get their mail on time.
Aang: They do get their mail on time, but my friend Bumi found a better
use for these chutes�

(Aang smiles mischievously, looking slightly o.c. Fade to a flashback
scene. A young boy with spiky orange hair tied with a headband looks out
over the city. Aang&#x27;s torso appears on the left side of the screen and the
boy turns to face him. The boy, Bumi, has a missing tooth and a slightly
insane facial expression.)

Bumi: Look around you, what do you see?
Aang: Umm� the mail system?
Bumi (conspiratorially): Instead of seeing what they want you to see, you
gotta open your brain to the possibilities.
Aang: A package sending system?
Bumi: The world&#x27;s greatest super slide!

(Cut to a wide shot of the top of the chute they are looking at. The shot
expands to show that is does look like a huge slide. Cut back to the
pair.)

Aang: Bumi, you&#x27;re a mad genius!

(Cut to Bumi, who smiles widely, laughs and snorts. Cut to Aang and Bumi
in one of the transport bins rocketing down the slide. The flashback ends,
but it is clear that Aang, Katara and Sokka are now at the same place in
the city where the flashback occurred. The view pans up to the top of the
slide where the three are now sitting one of the transport bins,
teetering. Aang is excited, the other two are leery.)

Aang: One ride, then we&#x27;re off to the North Pole, Airbender&#x27;s honor.
Katara: This sounded like fun at first, but now that I&#x27;m here, I&#x27;m
starting to have second thoughts!

(As Katara finishes her sentence the view cuts to an overhead shot that
shows the initial vertical drop. It is intimidating. As she finishes, the
bin drops into the chute and they rocket away. As the accelerate down the
chute, a neighboring chute becomes visible in the background. It is
clearly going to merge with the chute our group is in. A rack of spears is
dropping down this other chute and after the two paths merge, Sokka is
soon ducking to avoid getting killed. Katara and Sokka start making
distressed noises as they try and avoid the spears.)

Aang: I&#x27;m on it! I&#x27;m on it!

(Aang starts rocking the bin back and forth in the chute. He soon derails
them out of the chute and their bin freefalls onto a rooftop below. Cut to
a view of a group of Earth Kingdom soldier being addressed by an officer.)

Officer: Men, you&#x27;ll be going off to combat soon. It&#x27;s important that you
be prepared for anything.

(At this moment, the bin with our group falls into view, shocking the
audience. The frame stops with the accompanying sound effect of an
egg-timer going off.. Aang has grabbed the front of the bin and is
apparently trying to pull it up, his foot in Katara&#x27;s face. Sokka is
panicking in the back. The frame rate speeds up again as Aang airbends to
propel the bin back into the air and out of the screen. Within a shot or
two they have managed to drop back into a chute and are rocketing down
once again.)

Katara: Aang, do something! Use your airbending!
Aang: Yeh! Good idea! That&#x27;ll make us go even faster!

(Aang blasts air behind them, making them speed up. Cut to city dwellers
looking at them in alarm as they whiz by down the chute. As they approach
the drop down of the last major chute, they all screen as they see the
off-load point just in front of them. The off-load has a package on it
that they will hit. An earthbender next to it moves the package. Cut to
the kids, who breathe a sigh of relief. Cut back to the earthbender, who
raises another package into the off-load point. Cut back to the kids, who
scream again. Rather than hit the package, they hit the side of the trench
and run off the track again. They all fall out of the bin and are falling,
but Aang airbends them each back into the bin. They bounce off a roof and
into a man&#x27;s work room, destroying his pottery. They bounce of his floor
and out the window opposite the one they came in.)

Aang: Sorry!

(They drop into someone&#x27;s living room and fly through their house. Outside
they crash through the wall of the balcony and drop again, screaming. Cut
to the merchant from the earlier scene, fondly shaking one of his
cabbages. The sound of a bomb falling is heard. He looks up and jumps back
as the bin and the kids fall onto the cabbage cart, totally destroying it,
blowing cabbages all over the place. The kids land in a heap and Aang&#x27;s
disguise is now gone.)

Cabbage Merchant: My cabbages! You&#x27;re gonna pay for this!

(The three are quickly surrounded by soldiers.)

Aang (sheepishly): Two cabbages please.

(Fade to scene of King Bumi&#x27;s throne chamber. It is decorated in shades of
Earth Kingdom green. The aged King sits on his throne in the distance, for
it is a large room. Cut to the King, who wears the same crazy expression
as in Aang&#x27;s flashback, though he is now clearly ancient. The King looks
upon the three, and the guards behind them force them to kneel.)

King Bumi: Mmm?
Guard: Your majesty, these juveniles were arrested for vandalism,
traveling under false pretenses and malicious destruction of cabbages.

(Screen pans right to reveal the irate cabbage dealer.)

Cabbage Merchant: Off with their heads! One for each head of cabbage!
Guard: Silence! Only the King can pass down judgment. What is your
judgment, Sire?

(Close up of King Bumi. He looks at each in turn. Sokka is nervous, Katara
hopeful, and Aang tries to act like he&#x27;s invisible.)

King Bumi: Throw them�a feast!

(Guards make noises of surprise, the merchant of chagrin. Carnival music
plays in the background.)

Aang: Huh?

(Fade to a table loaded with food, camera pans right. Momo eats goodies on
the right side of the table. Cut to the three seated, with Aang in the
middle. Behind them King Bumi stands.)

King Bumi: Heheh! The people in my city have gotten fat from too many
feasts, so I hope you like your chicken with no skin.
Aang: Thanks, but I don&#x27;t eat meat.
King Bumi (to Sokka): How about you? I bet you like meat. (He sticks the
drumstick in Sokka&#x27;s mouth.)
Sokka (chewing): Mmm!
Katara (to Aang): Is it just me, or is this guy&#x27;s crown a little crooked?

(She makes cukoo motions at the side of her head as she says the latter.
Cut to King Bumi moving to take his seat at the opposite end of the
table.)

King Bumi: So, tell me young bald one. Where are you from?
Aang: I&#x27;m from�Kangaroo Island.
King Bumi: Oh, Kangaroo Island, eh? I hear that place is really hoppin!

(Cut to the three. Silence is broken by Sokka&#x27;s laughter, the other two
look at him like he has grown a third head.)

Sokka: What? It was pretty funny.
King Bumi (yawns): Well, all these good jokes are making me tired. Guess
it&#x27;s time to the hay.

(As he ends his sentence, he suddenly throws another drumstick at Aang,
who airbends it to a standstill, though he is very surprised. It spins in
the air in front of him. The guards draw breath in surprise.)

King Bumi: There&#x27;s an airbender in our presence and not just any
airbender, the Avatar! (He stands. Aang drops the drumstick, trying to act
like he did not just reveal himself.) Now what do you have to say for
yourself, Mr. Pipinpadaloxicopolis?

(Cut to commercial break.)

Scene II

(Long shot of the city, cut back to the feast table. Aang stands and
spreads his arms wide in a gesture of defeat.)

Aang: Okay! You caught me. I&#x27;m the Avatar, doing my Avatar thing, keeping
the world safe. Everything checks out (looks under the table), no
firebenders here. So, good work everybody. (Puts his arms around his
companions and together they stand.) Love each other, respect all life and
don&#x27;t run with your spears. We&#x27;ll see you next time!

(The three have been walking backwards to the door, but the guards stop
them. The shot widens to show the back of King Bumi in the foreground
looking at them.)

Katara: You can&#x27;t keep us here. Let us leave.
King Bumi: Lettuce leaf?

(He picks up a lettuce leaf from the plate in front of him and takes a
bite. Cut to the three as Sokka leans over to speak in a low voice to the
others. The carnival music has begun to play in the background.)

Sokka: We&#x27;re in serious trouble. This guy is nuts.
King Bumi (now very serious, the music stops): Tomorrow the Avatar will
face three deadly challenges. But for now, the guards will show you to
your chamber.
Guard: My liege, do you mean the good chamber, or the bad chamber?
King Bumi: The newly refurbished chamber.
Guard: Wait, which one are we talking about?
King Bumi: The one that used to be the bad chamber, until the recent
refurbishing that is. Of course, we&#x27;ve been calling it the new chamber,
but we really should number them. Uh, take them to the refurbished chamber
that was once bad!

(Cut to the three being led out by guards, then a close up of King Bumi
looking mad and chomping on lettuce. Cut to a wall that is torn open by
earthbending. The three are thrust in and the �door� is closed by
earthebending. The chamber is beautiful, spacious and furnished with three
comfortable beds.)

Katara: This is a prison cell? But it&#x27;s so nice.
Aang: He did say it was newly refurbished.
Sokka: Nice or not, we&#x27;re still prisoners.
Aang: I wonder what these challenges are gonna be.
Katara: We&#x27;re not sticking around to find out. There&#x27;s gotta be some way
outta here.
Aang (smiling and pointing o.c.): The air vents!
Sokka: If you think we&#x27;re gonna fit through there then you&#x27;re crazier then
that king.

(Cut to view of the air vent. It is a small circular hole in the wall.)

Aang: We can&#x27;t, but Momo can.

(Cut to view of Momo sprawled on the bed, gorged on an apple, his tongue
still licking the fruit. The shot expands to show Aang entering from the
right.)

Aang: Momo, I need you to find Appa and bust us outta here!

(Camera switches to a view from inside the air vent. The light from the
room is blocked as Aang stuffs Momo face first into the vent. Soon Momo&#x27;s
face is right up against the camera. Cut to shot of Aang stuffing the
little animal into the vent and having some trouble.)

Aang: Go on, boy, get Appa!

(He stops, only to have Momo&#x27;s behind dangle from the vent. He is stuck.)

Sokka: Eh, how was Appa supposed to save us anyway?
Aang (from o.c., as Momo tries to free himself, but fails): Appa is a ten
ton flying bison, I think he could figure something out.
Katara: Well, no point in arguing about it now. (She gets in a bed.) Get
some rest, Aang. Looks like you&#x27;ll need it for tomorrow.

(Aang walks dejectedly over to the last unoccupied bed. Fade to a shot of
Aang asleep, snoring loudly. The room shakes as an earthbender opens the
�door.� Aang opens his eyes to see the other beds empty.)

Aang: Sokka! Katara! (Turning to guards) Where are my friends?
Guard: The King will free them if you complete your challenges.
Aang: And if I fail?
Guard: He didn&#x27;t say. Your staff please?

(Aang gives the staff to the guard. Cut to Aang entering the throne room
flanked by two guards. King Bumi&#x27;s torso appears on the left side of the
screen. He is wearing a horrible, blue, purple and light green robe.)

King Bumi: First, Avatar, what do you think of my new outfit? I want your
honest opinion.

(Cut to Aang who has no reaction. A cough is heard in the background. Cut
back to the King.)

King Bumi: I&#x27;m waiting.
Aang: I�guess it&#x27;s fine.
King Bumi: Excellent! You passed the first test.
Aang: Really?
King Bumi (thinking): Well, not one of the deadly tests. The real
challenges are much more�challenging.

(Aang&#x27;s expression becomes angry. He airbends his feet to run in an
instant up to King Bumi.)

Aang: I don&#x27;t have time for your crazy games! Gimme my friends back! We&#x27;re
leaving!
King Bumi: Ohh, I thought you might refuse�

(Cut to a shot with the King on the left, Aang on the right, and a view of
the wall of the chamber between them. At this moment a �door&#x27; is opened by
guards holding Katara and Sokka in the corridor beyond. The guards place
small rings on one of their fingers which contract to fit snugly as soon
as they are worn. Sokka and Katara struggle to take off the rings, but
can&#x27;t.)

King Bumi: �so I will give your friends some special souvenirs. Those
delightful rings are made of pure genemite, also known as creeping
crystal. It&#x27;s crystal that grows remarkably fast. By nightfall your
friends will be completely covered in it. Terrible fate, really. I can
stop it, but only if you cooperate.

(Close up of the ring on Sokka&#x27;s finger. It grows in front of the camera.
Cut to Sokka&#x27;s face.)

Sokka: Ah! It&#x27;s already creeping!
Aang (to King Bumi): I&#x27;ll do as you want.
King Bumi (grinning evilly): Mmm!

(Fade to new scene of a cavern. Camera pans left to reveal Aang standing
on a small stone parapet with a waterfall in the background. The cavern
floor is covered in stalagmites. In the upper left corner of the screen,
King Bumi, the guards and the prisoners stand on a balcony. Crystal
already covers the forearms of both. King Bumi laughs.)

King Bumi: It seems I&#x27;ve lost my lunch box key and I&#x27;m hungry.

(Cut to a close up shot of a key hanging by a long chain in the middle of
the waterfall. A ladder reaches up from the ground of the cavern to about
where the key dangles.)

King Bumi: Ooo, there it is. Would you mind fetching it for me?

(Aang jumps into action. Using his airbending skills he bouces from
stalagmite to stalagmite. He charges into the waterfall, holding his
breath, and begins to climb the ladder. The force of the water stops him
from making progress, though.)

King Bumi: Ooo, climbing the ladder. No one&#x27;s thought of that before.

(Aang loses his grip and is shot out of the waterfall. He is about to get
impaled when he recovers and slides between two stalagmites, one foot on
the side of each. He breathes a sigh of relief. He looks up at his friends
and regains his determination. This time he flies up to the stalactites on
the ceiling and is soon looking down at the key. He concentrates, jumps
into the waterfall, and is shot right back out, managing to grab onto a
stalagmite. Cut to King Bumi and the prisoners. The crystal now covers
them up to the shoulder.)

King Bumi: That&#x27;s right. Keep diving head in, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll work
eventually.

(This gives Aang an idea. He breaks off the top of the stalagmite he is
holding and throws it at the chain holding the key. Using his airbending
skills he makes sure it breaks the chain and carries the bottom part of it
along with the key up to the balcony. The tip of the stalagmite embeds
itself like a spearhead into the top of the doorway. The key now dangles
just over the surprised King&#x27;s head.)

Aang: There, enjoy your lunch! I want my friends back, now!
King Bumi: Uh, not yet. I need help with another matter. It seems I&#x27;ve
lost my pet Flopsy.

(Cut to a fluffy bunny sitting on a rock. The scene expands to show Aang
landing in the background.)

Aang: Okay, found him!

(The view expands again to reveal Aang and the bunny in the middle of a
shallow arena. King Bumi and the prisoners are at the railing around the
top of the arena.)

King Bumi: Bring him to me! Daddy wants a kiss from Flopsy!

(Cut to Aang and Flopsy. Behind Aang a huge monster is landing.)

Aang: Come here, Flopsy!

(Aang turns around to face the monster while the bunny squeaks and runs
off. The monster crushes a huge boulder in front of Aang. He flips
backwards and lands as the bunny runs by him, squealing in terror.)

Aang: Flopsy, wait! Flopsy! Flopsy!

(Aang chases the bunny while the monster chases Aang. Cut to King Bumi,
who is cackling maniacally. The bunny runs into a rabbit hole in the wall
of the arena. Aang slides up next to it and sticks his hand in the hole.
He rummages around, but finds nothing. Meanwhile, the monster closes in.
Aang has another idea. He stands up and faces the monster just as it
arrives.)

Aang (to monster): Flopsy?

(The monster stops instantly and wags its tail. Flopsy picks Aang up
tenderly, making gentle noises. Aang is surprised and starts screaming. He
stops when Flopsy gives him a huge lick.)

Aang: Flopsy!

(He rubs Flopsy&#x27;s head. Flopsy&#x27;s drops Aang and scales the arena wall in
response to King Bumi&#x27;s o.c. whistling and kissing noises. He flops on
back in front of King Bumi. Carnival music begins to play.)

King Bumi: Awww, that&#x27;s a good boy! Yes, who has a soft belly?

(He begins to rub Flopsy&#x27;s belly. Flopsy&#x27;s left leg paws the ground in
pleasure. Cut to Aang jumping up onto the railing of the arena. Katara is
in the foreground, covered from head to ankle in crystal. The carnival
music stops.)

Aang: Guys, are you ok?
Katara: Other than the crystal slowly encasing my entire body, doing
great.

(Camera pans right to Sokka who is in similar straits. A new length of
crystal grows on the left side of Sokka&#x27;s head. He loses his balance and
keels over. Cut to King Bumi rubbing Flopsy&#x27;s belly.)

King Bumi: Awww, yes.
Aang (looking severe): Come on. I&#x27;m ready for the next challenge.
King Bumi: Ahh! Hahaha!

(Fade to next scene with King Bumi still laughing maniacally o.c. The new
scene is of an earthbending arena. It is ill-lit and largely featureless
except the dirt floor. Cut to two balconies, Aang and King Bumi on one,
the prisoners, now encased in crystal except for their faces and feet, on
the other.)

King Bumi: Your final test is a duel and as a special treat you may choose
your opponent. Point and choose.

(Two enormous gladiator type characters show up to flank King Bumi. The
champion on the left is a muscular man with a nasty smile and a huge axe.
The champion on the right is a mammoth fighter whoe looks like he relies
upon brute strength. Aang is terrified.)

Aang (thinking): So, you&#x27;re saying whoever I point to, that&#x27;s the person I
get to fight?
King Bumi: Choose wisely.

(Cut to Aang&#x27;s p.o.v. as the camera ranges between the King and the two
champions.)

Aang: I�choose�you! (He is pointing at King Bumi.)
King Bumi: Haha! Wrong choice!

(King Bumi, with some effort, corrects his lumped posture. He dumps his
robes to reveal a surprisingly muscular physique for such an old man. He
is clearly formidable and Aang recoils, realizing his mistake. The King is
also apparently a master earthbender, for he immediately stamps the
ground, blowing Aang far out into the arena. He lands in the dust. King
Bumi launches himself off the balcony and lands close to Aang. He laughs
evilly as the scene cuts to commercial break.)

Scene III

(Return to a long shot of the arena. Cut to King Bumi staring Aang down.)

King Bumi: You thought I was a frail old man, but I&#x27;m the most powerful
earthbender you&#x27;ll ever see.
Aang: Can I fight the guy with the axe instead?
King Bumi: There are no �take-back-sees&#x27; in my kingdom. You might need
this!

(King Bumi motions to a guard who throws Aang his staff. King Bumi
immediately launches several boulders at him which Aang dodges.)

King Bumi: Typical airbender tactic: avoid and evade. I&#x27;d hoped the Avatar
would be less predictable.

(He launches another boulder at Aang, who dodges and launches himself into
the air.)

King Bumi: Don&#x27;t you have any surprises for me? Sooner or later, you&#x27;ll
have to strike back.

(The King launches another stone at Aang which misses, but explodes upon
impacting the ceiling of the arena. The debris knocks Aang to the ground
and he loses his staff as he falls. Aang gets back up as King Bumi begins
walking around. With each turn he makes a huge pillar of rock block Aang&#x27;s
path. One of them catches Aang in the gut as it rises into the air.)

King Bumi: Oh, you&#x27;ll have to be a little more creative than that!

(Aang jumps off the pillar, riding one of his famous airballs. He rides
the wall of the arena and approaches the King from his right. He launches
a huge gale at his opponent, who blocks it with a sheet of stone raised
from the floor of the arena. Cut to the King emerging from behind the
stone shield, a smile on his face. The carnival music plays again.)

King Bumi: Did someone leave the windows open? It feels a little drafty in
here! (Screen zooms to a close up of the King, who drops his smile.) Are
you hoping I&#x27;ll catch a cold?

(Cut to Aang dropping off his airball and a quick cut back to the King,
who kicks over the stone sheet and begins to raise it on earth dug out of
the arena&#x27;s surface. He shoots the earth underneath the stone sheet at
Aang which knocks him over. The King strikes the ground with his fist,
sending a shock wave through the arena surface right at Aang. The Avatar
flips backwards and avoids the shock wave, but now is close to the rear
wall of the arena.)

King Bumi: How are you going to going to get me from way over there?

(Aang looks determined and begins to run to his opponent. Cut to King Bumi
who uses the side of his foot to dash the earth. The ground around Aang
becomes quicksand and he falls in. The King raises two boulders and sends
them to smash the struggling Aang. He escapes just in time as the rocks
smash together. Aang jumps straight at his opponent, unleashing a blast of
wind that knocks him and the stone sheet he stands upon back against the
wall of the arena. The King raises one of the boulders from where he had
just failed to crush Aang and pulled it back towards him at frightening
speed. The Avatar sees it just in time and does a backflip that barely
allows him to get up and over the flying boulder. The boulder of course
moves on to almost crush the King, but he breaks it into many pieces as it
reaches him. With tremendous effort, King Bumi tears the entire gate area
of the arena out of the ground and holds it over his head. Aang screams in
terror and begins to run in circles, creating a tornado. The King throws
the massive earth mound, but the tornado grabs it and throws it back at
him. As it reaches King Bumi he bisects it neatly in two. Aang appears
between the rock pieces and pins the King with his staff. The King smiles
and looks up. Cut to Aang who also looks up as a little piece of rock
bounces off his head. Overhead hovers one of the two halves of rock, ready
to crush them both.)

King Bumi: Hehe! Well done, Avatar. You fight with much fire in your
heart.

(The King throws the rock to the side of the arena. He then falls
backwards into the floor, disappearing and leaving a Bumi shaped hole.
Aang is flabbergasted.)

Aang: Huh?

(Cut to the prisoners. A hole opens up in the floor of the balcony and the
King emerges, the hole closing instantly beneath him. Aang, using his
staff as a helicopter blade, lands on the balcony.)

King Bumi: You&#x27;ve passed all my tests. Now, you must answer one question.
Aang: That&#x27;s not fair! You said you would release my friends if I finished
your tests.
King Bumi: Oh, but what&#x27;s the point of tests if you don&#x27;t learn anything?
Sokka: Oh come on!
King Bumi: Answer this one question and I will set your friends free. (Cut
to a close up of King Bumi&#x27;s face) What�is my name? (Cut to Aang, who does
not have a ready answer.) From the looks of your friends, I&#x27;d say you only
have a few minutes. (Exit King Bumi.)
Aang: How am I supposed to know his name?
Katara: Think about the challenges, maybe it&#x27;s some kind of riddle.
Sokka: I got it!
Aang: Yeh?
Sokka: He&#x27;s an earthbender, right? Rocky! (Silence, followed by a cough in
the background.) You know, because of all the rocks?
Katara: We&#x27;re gonna keep trying, but that is a good backup.
Aang: Okay, so back to the challenges. I got a key from the waterfall. I
saved his pet and I had a duel.
Katara: And what did you learn?
Aang: Well, everything was different than I expected.
Katara (a piece of crystal growing into her cheek): And�?
Aang: Well, they weren&#x27;t straightforward. To solve each test, I had to
think differently than I usually would. (Realization sweeping his
features.) I know his name!

(Fade to the King&#x27;s throne room. Aang and the King stand opposite each
other. King Bumi is once again hunched over and in his regular green
robes.)

Aang: I solved the question the same way I solved the challenges. As you
said a long time ago, I had to open my brain to the possibilities. (Cut
King Bumi, who begins to laugh and snort, just as the younger version had
in the flashback.) Bumi, you&#x27;re a mad genius! (He runs and hugs the old
King.)
King Bumi: Oh, Aang. It&#x27;s good to see you. You haven&#x27;t changed a bit.
Literally.

(Aang&#x27;s old friend rubs Aang&#x27;s head. Katara and Sokka approach from the
left side of the screen, still encased in crystal. Cut to Katara&#x27;s face,
which is now all that is visible.)

Katara: Uh, over here!

(Pan to Sokka&#x27;s mouth, which is all that is visible of him.)

Sokka: Little help?

(Cut to the King and Aang, the former of which makes a pulling back
gesture with a fist, shattering the crystal from around both water tribe
members. Crystal flies all over and King Bumi catches a piece.)

King Bumi: Genemite is made of rock candy. (He takes a bite). Delicious!
Katara: So this crazy king is your old friend, Bumi?
King Bumi (annoyed): Who you calling old? (Pause.) Okay. I&#x27;m old.
Sokka: Why did you do all this instead of just telling Aang who you were?
King Bumi: First of all, it&#x27;s pretty fun messing with people, hehe (snort!
snort!), but I do have a reason. (Turning to Aang). Aang, you have a
difficult task ahead. The world has changed in the hundred years you&#x27;ve
been gone. It&#x27;s the duty of the Avatar to restore balance to the world by
defeating Fire Lord Ozai. You have much to learn. You must master the four
elements and confront the Fire Lord, and when you do, I hope you will
think like a mad genius! (Cut to Aang, who smiles, clasps his hands
together in thanks, and bows.) And it looks like you&#x27;re in good hands.
You&#x27;ll need your friends to help defeat the Fire Nation. (Momo jumps onto
Aang&#x27;s shoulder.) And you&#x27;ll need Momo too.
Aang: Thank you for your wisdom. But before we leave, I have a challenge
for you!

(Cut to a shot of the city. Pan right to reveal a chute. A moment later a
delivery bin flies by, King Bumi at the front, Aang in the back. Both are
having a blast as the air rushes by them. Cut to long shot of the city
where a plume of dust and smoke rises after an impact sound is heard.)

Cabbage Merchant (in anguish): My cabbages!

奥玛舒城主

这就是土强国的奥玛舒城
我从前经常来这儿找我的朋友布米玩
哇，我们在南极可没有这样的城市
他们在这儿建的屋子竟然不会融化
（只有你才想让屋子融化吧，汗一个）
你俩别再磨磨蹭蹭的了，好玩的都在城里呢
嘿，安昂，如果人们发现
你是降世神通，可能会有危险
-你得伪装一下
-咋伪装，难道让我长出胡子不成？
真是太痒了
真同情你，怎么能忍受有这么多毛长在身上
太好了，现在你看起来正像我的祖父
说真的，安昂的年纪真的可以当祖父了
小子们，别在那唧唧歪歪了，咱们赶紧进城喽
你们会爱死奥玛舒的，这里住着世界上最友善的人们
竟敢带烂卷心菜进城卖，你以为这里是贫民窟呢
我的卷心菜呀~~~
记着保持微笑啊
赶紧交待，来此干何？
我想干啥就干啥，你小毛孩子管啥
我可没老糊涂，别想吓唬我，哪凉快哪待着去
好了，好了，老前辈，怕了你了。说说你到底是谁
俺叫般祖，姓皮品帕大佬喜酷魄力斯，三世
这是我的孙子孙女
你好啊,我是朱-皮品帕大佬喜酷魄力斯, 请多多关照
-年轻人,你看起来还很靠谱，别让你的爷爷到处
惹事生非. 在奥玛舒好好玩吧!    -谢了
等一下
你是个强壮的年轻人,应该尊敬老人,快帮你的爷爷拿包
说得对啊~
这就是奥玛舒的运输系统
由弯弯曲曲，绵延N里的管道和斜坡组成
御土师们用御土术向上运东西，滑道用于向下运东西
-太好了，这就可以让他们及时收到信喽
-那可不呗
但是我的朋友布米发现了这个系统的新用处
好好看看周围，你发现了什么？
嗯，信件配送系统？
那只是表面的东西，你应该开动脑筋，
解放思想，看到所有的可能性
它还可以配送包裹?
这就是世界上最大的超级滑梯
布米，你真是个怪才
咱们就玩一把，然后就直奔北极，我以气宗的名誉担保
听来觉得会很好玩，但是一到这，我开始...
...犹豫了！（犹豫也晚了：〉）
别担心，交给我了
兄弟们，你们就要奔赴战场了，
之前你们要做好所有准备
安昂，做点什么，用用御气术（让它慢点）
真是个好主意，御气术可以让我们再快点
抱歉了
我的卷心菜，你们得赔我
就来两个卷心菜吧
阁下，这几个年轻人由于蓄意破坏公物，
伪冒身份，恶意毁坏卷心菜等罪名被捕
砍了他们的头，每个头顶我一颗卷心菜
肃静，只有城主才能宣判。阁下，您的判决是什么
给他们...
一顿大餐
太多的美食让我的子民们体重都超了标
鸡肉现在都是剥了皮的，不介意吧
-谢谢，但是出家人不吃肉
-你想不想吃啊？
我打赌你一定很爱吃
不是只有我一个人觉得这老头脑子有点问题吧？
告诉我，小秃头，你从哪来啊？
我来自袋鼠岛
嗯，袋鼠岛，听说那是个很活跃的地方
怎么了，他说得是挺好笑的啊
讲笑话还真是累啊，是时候该运动运动了
我这儿居然有个御气师，还不是一般人呢
你是降世神通吧！
咋样，皮品帕大佬喜酷魄力斯先生
你有啥要辩解的吗？
好了，好了，被你逮到了，我就是降世神通
我就是想做好本职工作，维护世界和平
到处检查。不错，这儿没有御火师。
那么，干得好，各位。
让我们相亲相爱，善待生命，
不要矛戈相向。下回见喽
你不能把我们关在这儿，让我们走
什么，生菜叶子？
（Let us leave与lettuce leaf谐音）
我们这回麻烦大了，这家伙明摆脑子有问题
明天，降世神通将接受项终极挑战，
但是现在带他们去牢房
殿下，你是指好的那个，还是不好的那个
-我是指那个重翻修的牢房
-等等，咱们说的是哪个？
在翻修前它就是那个不好的牢房
我们现在叫它新牢房，其实我们应该给会所编编号
带他们去那个新翻修的牢房，就是原来的那个坏牢房
这是牢房？看样还不赖嘛
-他不是说刚装修过嘛
-就算它再好，也是牢房
-会是什么挑战呢？
-我们可不会留下来参加什么挑战
肯定有方法能够逃出去
对了，可以从通气孔出去
你不是被那个疯老头传染了吧，
那么小的孔咱们怎么出去？
虽然我们不能，但模模可以
模模，快去找阿柏，好把我们救出去
加油啊，伙计，赶紧去找阿柏
阿柏来了又能怎么样？
阿柏可是个吨重的飞天野牛，它肯定会有办法的
现在可不是讨论的时候，安昂，
快休息吧，明天你需要体力
索卡, 卡塔拉, 我的朋友在哪?
如果你能完成挑战, 城主就会放了他们
-那我要是失败了呢?
-城主没说,请交出你的武器
首先, 降世神通, 看看我的新造型怎么样, 我需要听听你的意见
我可等着呢
-我觉得...还好吧
-不错,你已经通过了第一项挑战
-真的吗?
-但不是终极挑战, 终极挑战要更具挑战性
我可没时间玩你的疯子游戏, 赶快把我的朋友交出来, 放我们走
我就知道你要拒绝我,
所以特意给你的朋友准备了纪念品
那个闪闪发光的戒指是由纯“微基因”
（genemite, 暂译）制成,
也就是大家常说得&quot;蔓延水晶&quot;
这种水晶增长的很快, 黄昏前你的朋友就会被它完全覆盖,是挺吓人的
我是可以停止它, 但前提是你要合作
啊, 它已经在长了
我会照你说得做的
看来我弄丢了我午餐饭盒的钥匙, 天哪, 我饿死了
啊, 原来在那儿, 你介意帮我拿一下吗?
噢, 要爬梯子啊, 以前怎么就没人想到呢
这就对了嘛, 继续啊, 迟早你能搞到钥匙
好好享用你的午餐吧, 现在快把我的朋友还给我
还不行, 你还得帮我一个忙, 我的宠物 弗洛布西 不见了
-好了, 找到它了
-把它带回来, 爹地要亲亲小弗洛布西
到这儿来, 弗洛布西
弗洛布西, 等等, 弗洛布西
弗洛布西
等一下
你是弗洛布西??
弗洛布西
这才是我的小乖乖呢，这是谁的大肚皮啊？
-伙计们，你们怎么样啊？
-除了有水晶在身上长啊长得，其他都不错
赶紧的，下一个挑战是啥？
下一个挑战是单挑决斗，对你特别对待
你可以选择你的对手
-要选谁，指指就行？
-你是说，我指到谁就可以和谁决斗吗？
慎重考虑啊！
我，我选你
哼，哼， 选错了
你以为我是个若不经风的糟老头吧，
可我将是你所见过的最厉害的御土师
我能换和那个那斧子家伙打吗？
在我的国家可没后悔药卖，拿上你的武器开打吧
典型的气宗套路，躲躲藏藏的；
原来降世神通就这么两下子
就不能给我点惊喜吗？早晚你都得反击
拜托，不能多点创造力吗
有谁没关窗吗，怎么感觉到小风嗖嗖的
你不是指望着我会感冒呢吧
隔那么远，你咋能达到我呢
干得好啊，降世神通，你点燃了心中的斗志
不错，你通过了所有的挑战，
现在你必须回答我一个问题
这不公平，你说过如果我通过你的挑战，
你就释放我的朋友
-但是没学到东西的挑战又怎么能叫挑战呢？
-少来了
只要回答上我的问题，就放你的朋友
问题就是：我叫啥
从你的朋友的表情上看，你只有几分钟了
-我咋会知道他的名字？
-仔细想想那些挑战，可能是某种谜语
我知道了，他是个御土师，
那么就叫洛奇吧（Roky），反正跟石头有关
你还真是帮上忙了，那样的名字多了去了
-好的，回顾一下挑战，我在瀑布中拿了把钥匙，
救了个宠物，还单挑了
-你从中学到了什么？
-事事出乎预料...
-还有呢？
那个，凡事不能只看表面，
要想完成这些挑战，
我必须换个角度思考问题。我知道他的名字了
找到这个问题的答案和完成挑战的方法是一样的
正如你很久之前说过的，我的开动脑筋，解放我的思想
布米, 你真是个怪才
噢，安昂，能再见到你真好，你真是一点也没变啊
-别忘了我们啊
-帮帮忙
这所谓的“微基因”是用“糖石“做的，太好吃了
那么说这个疯国王就是你的老朋友布米?
啥？你说我“老”，哎，我是老了
你干嘛要搞这些东东，
直接告诉安昂你是谁不就得了？
和别人闹着玩是一件特好玩的事，
而且我这么做也是有道理的。
安昂，你肩上的任务很重
在你离开的年里，这个世界变了很多
你是降世神通，所以有责任调谐天下和平，
和火王“欧宰” （暂译）决一死战
你还有很多东西要学，
必须掌握好四种元素才能和他匹敌
当你们最终决战时，希望你能像怪才一样思考问题
看来你找到了好的帮手，
你需要他们和你协力对抗火王
你也同样需要模模啊
听君一席言，胜读十年书啊，
但在我们离开之前，我也给你准备了一个挑战
啊，我的卷心菜啊！
-=未完待续=-

水善国
土强国
火烈国
气和国
很久以前，这四大国和谐共处
然而，火国发起的战争结束了和平
只有同时掌握四种元素的将世神通才能结束战争
然而在大家最需要他的时候，他却消失了
年后，我和哥哥发现了新的降世神通，
他是个御气师，名叫安昂
尽管他的御气术着实厉害
在拯救苍生之前，他要学的还有很多
但是我坚信安昂能拯救这个世界

-=降世神通=-
