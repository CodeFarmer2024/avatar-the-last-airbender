Act I

(Scene opens with a shot of the star filled evening sky. The camera pans
down to Prince Zuko&#x27;s ship gliding through the ocean. Scene cuts to a slow
pan of his quarters aboard the ship. Zuko is seen sitting in the lotus
position in front of an altar. Four white candles are burning in front of
him. The camera continues to pan as the light from the candles increases
and decreases with Zuko&#x27;s rhythmic breathing. Cut to a frontal shot of
Zuko with eyes closed in meditation. His face is calm and concentrated.
The camera cuts to a side view of Zuko&#x27;s head on the left half of the
screen with the door to his quarters on the right side. The door opens and
General Iroh enters the room.)

Zuko: (in a dangerously silky voice) The only reason you should be
interrupting me is if you have news about the Avatar.
Iroh: (enters cautiously carrying a map) Well, there is news, Prince Zuko,
but you might not like it. Don&#x27;t get too upset.
Zuko: (calmly) Uncle, you taught me that keeping a level head is a sign of
a great leader. Now whatever you have to say, I&#x27;m sure that I can take it.

Iroh: Okay, then... we have no idea where he is.
Zuko: (enraged) WHAT?!

(The four candles flare to the ceiling with Zuko&#x27;s wrath. He stands
quickly and turns around to face his uncle, his anger evident on his face.
Iroh turns away from the flames and raises his right arm to protect his
face. As the flames subside, he pulls a fan out of his robes.)

Iroh: (fanning himself) You really should open a window in here.
Zuko: (snatching the map from Iroh&#x27;s hand) Give me the map!

(Zuko opens the rolled scroll and begins to study it. Iroh continues to
fan himself.)

Iroh: There have been multiple sightings of the Avatar, but he is
impossible to track down.
Zuko: How am I gonna find him, Uncle?

(He looks down at the map marked with circled Xs and dotted lines
connecting the reported Avatar sightings. The lines zigzag all over the
landmass drawings.)

Zuko: He is clearly a master of evasive maneuvering.

(Scene ends with a fade from the map in Zuko&#x27;s hands to the map in Sokka&#x27;s
hands. Scene cuts to a close up of Sokka reading the map. He is sitting
atop Appa with an exasperated expression on his face.)

Sokka: You have no idea where you&#x27;re going, do you?

(Scene cuts to a wider angle of Sokka, Katara, and Aang riding Appa
through the air.)

Aang: (turning his head back to answer Sokka) Weeelll, I know it&#x27;s near
water...

(Scene cuts to a distant view of Appa flying over an endless stretch of
water.)

Sokka: (flatly) I guess we&#x27;re getting close then.

(Scene cuts to Katara mending a garment. Aang has his head turned back,
watching her. Momo, who is also watching Katara, is sitting on Aang&#x27;s left
shoulder.)

Aang: Momo, marbles please.

(Momo scrambles into Aang&#x27;s shirt making noises. He returns with a marble
and hands it to Aang.)

Aang: (smiling eagerly and cupping the marble in his two hands) Hey
Katara! Check out this airbending trick!

(Aang suspends the marble between his two hands and makes it whirl around
and around in mid-air. He is grinning happily at Katara, wanting her
attention. Katara is preoccupied, though, and does not look up from her
sewing.)

Katara: (absentmindedly) That&#x27;s great, Aang.
Aang: (crushed that she did not notice) You didn&#x27;t even look.
Katara: (stops her sewing and looks at him) That&#x27;s great!
Aang: But I&#x27;m not doing it now.

(Scene cuts to a shot of just Sokka and Katara. Sokka is lolling at the
back of Appa&#x27;s saddle with his arms crossed casually behind his head.)

Sokka: (waves his arm dismissively in Aang and Katara&#x27;s direction) Stop
bugging her, airhead. You need to give girls space when they do their
sewing.

(Scene cuts to a close up of Katara&#x27;s face. She stops her needle in midair
and turns her head towards Sokka. Her face is a mixture of annoyance and
anger.)

Katara: What does me being a girl have to do with sewing?

(Scene cuts back to Sokka)

Sokka: Simple: girls are better at fixing pants than guys, and guys are
better at hunting and fighting and stuff like that. It&#x27;s just the natural
order of things.
Katara: (with exaggerated happiness) All done with your pants! And look
what a great job I did!

(Katara glowers at Sokka and throws his pants at him. They hit him in the
head.)

Sokka: Wait! I was just kidding! I can&#x27;t wear these! (He sticks his arm
through the big hole in the seat of his pants.) Katara, PLEASE!

(Scene cuts to a frontal shot of all three on Appa&#x27;s back.)

Aang: Don&#x27;t worry, Sokka. Where we&#x27;re going, you won&#x27;t need any pants!

(He gives a pull on the reings and Appa and swoops down in the sky,
glowering . The scene shifts to an aerial view of a crescent-shaped
island. Scene cuts to Appa, Aang, Katara, and Sokka on a beach.
Snow-capped mountains are visible in the background.

Sokka: We just made a pit stop yesterday. Shouldn&#x27;t we get a little more
flying done before we camp out?
Katara: He&#x27;s right. At this rate we won&#x27;t get to the North Pole until
spring.
Aang: (shading his face and looking out over the water) But Appa&#x27;s tired
already, aren&#x27;t you boy? I said, aren&#x27;t you boy?

(Aang nudges Appa conspiratorially with his elbow. Appa yawns on cue, but
is obviously not actually tired. Aang sticks his thumb in the big bison&#x27;s
direction.)

Sokka: Yeah, that was real convincing. Still, hard to argue with a ten ton
magical monster.
Aang: (gasps excitedly and points out towards the water) LOOK! (A giant
koi fish jumps out of the water.) That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re here... (Aang strips
down to his underwear.)... elephant koi. And I&#x27;m going to ride it. Katara,
you&#x27;ve gotta watch me! (Aang dives into the water. A second later he leaps
out again with a shocked expression on his face.) COLD!

(Scene cuts to Katara and Sokka looking at each other wryly. Sokka makes
the univeral &quot;he&#x27;s crazy&quot; signal by twirling his finger next to his head.
Cut to Aang swimming out into the bay. Aang dives under the water and
catches hold of an elephant koi. The giant fish leaps out of the water
with Aang riding on its back, his hands grasping the dorsal fin. The koi
dives back into the water, carrying Aang with it.

(Scene cuts to Katara watching Aang. She has an excited and interested
look on her face, clearly enjoying his current antics. Sokka, Katara, and
Momo stand on shore and watch Aang. Scene cuts to a close up of Aang on
the back of the elephant koi. Laughing, he waves to Katara. Cut to Katara
on shore waving to Aang.)

Katara: (waving) Woo!
Aang: Yeeaaaah! Woohoo! (Aang is laughing, ecstatic as he rides the giant
koi fish. A couple of other fish follow behind, leaping in and out of the
water.

(All the giant koi fish dive underwater and the camera follows them. Cut
to Katara and Sokka on the shore. Momo is jumping up and down, watching
Aang intently.)

Katara: He looks pretty good out there.
Sokka: Are you kidding? The fish is doing all the work.
Katara: (Katara turns to see look at something happening off screen.) No,
Appa! Don&#x27;t eat that! (Katara hurries off screen as Sokka continues to
watch Aang.)

(Scene cuts to a close up of Aang riding the elephant koi. He grins
broadly at Katara, who runs towards the trees. Aang is disappointed that
she is no longer watching him.)

Aang: Aww, man...

(Scene cuts to a long view of the bay. Three elephant koi are visible
swimming on the surface of the water. Two of the koi, including the one
Aang is riding, veer off to the right. A shadow under the water is visible
approaching the remaining elephant koi. Scene cuts to a close up of Sokka
on shore.)

Sokka: (yells) There&#x27;s something in the water!

(Scene cuts to the last koi fish trying to leap out of the water, but
being pulled under. Cut to a close up of Aang still riding his koi fish.
Something is approaching him from behind. Cut back to the shore. Momo,
distressed, is jumping up and down. Katara, hearing the commotion, runs up
beside Sokka back on the beach.)

Katara: What&#x27;s wrong?
Sokka: Aang&#x27;s in trouble. (yells) Aang!
Katara: (screams) Get out of there!

(Scene cuts to Aang on the fish. He is watching Katara, Sokka and Momo on
the shore. They are waving their arms and yelling to him.)

Sokka: Come back here! AANG!
Katara: AANG!

(Scene cuts to Aang waving back at Sokka and Katara, misinterpreting their
frantic gestures. The koi fish he is riding bucks and sends Aang headlong
into the bay. He comes up a second after going under and spurts water out
of his mouth. He is breathing heavily and gasping for air as an enormous
serrated fin rises ominously from the water behind him. Cut to a wide shot
of a very tiny Aang against the fin&#x27;s back drop. Cut to a close up of
Aang&#x27;s back as he turns around slowly to see what&#x27;s following close behind
him. His eyes widen and he screams in panic.)

Aang: Aaahhh!

(Aang leaps to the surface of the water and begins to run towards shore.
The enormous fin turns and begins to chase him. Cut to a wide shot of the
chase as the fin gains on Aang. He reaches the shore, running head first
and full force into Sokka. Aang knocks Sokka off his feet and they both
crash back towards the tree line. The fin turns and slowly heads back out
to sea. Katara runs back to where Aang and Sokka are. Aang is putting his
clothes back on while Sokka sits lumped up against the tree they skidded
into.)

Katara: What was that thing?
Aang: I don&#x27;t know.
Sokka: (getting up and wiping his hands together) Well, let&#x27;s not stick
around and find out. Time to hit the road.

(Scene cuts to an aerial view. Four green clad warriors fall on Aang,
Sokka, Katara, and Momo from the trees. The first warrior grabs Sokka
under his arms from behind. The second warrior pulls Katara&#x27;s hood over
her head. The third warrior grabs Aang by his shirt. The fourth warrior
traps Momo in a small sack. Cut to Momo, Aang, Katara, and Sokka, all
bound and blindfolded being thrown to the ground at the feet of their
captors. Four sets of green-robed legs are visible in a circle around
them.)

Momo: (hits the ground) Oof!
Aang: (thrown to the ground) Ugh!
Katara: (thrown to the ground) Uhh...
Sokka: (thrown to the ground) Oof... Or we could stay a while...

(Scene cuts to a snow covered mountain path, lined on both sides by the
wintry forest. The camera pans up towards the mountain peak. Scene cuts to
the back of the village leader, Oyagi. He has long gray hair, with a high
poofy ponytail on top of his head. The camera pans to the left to show
Aang, Sokka, and Katara, still blindfolded, bound to a large pole in a
fenced clearing. Momo, still in a sack, is at Aang&#x27;s feet.)

Oyagi: You three have some explaining to do.
Suki: And if you don&#x27;t answer all our questions, we&#x27;re throwing you back
in the water with the unagi.
Sokka: (close-up of his angry face) Show yourselves, cowards!

(Cut to black. Scene changes as Sokka&#x27;s, Aang&#x27;s and Katara&#x27;s blindfolds
are removed to reveal five young girls dressed in green. Their faces are
painted white with red around their eyes, and they carry fans in their
waistbands. Scene cuts to a wide shot of Aang, Sokka, Katara, and Momo
tied to the pole on the left of the screen. The green clad girls and Oyagi
are on the right.)

Sokka: (straining at his bonds) Who are you? Where are the men who
ambushed us?
Suki: (stepping toward Sokka and shaking her fist at him) There were no
men. We ambushed you. Now tell us, who are you and what are you doing
here?
Sokka: (in laughing disbelief) Wait a second, there&#x27;s no way that a bunch
of girls took us down.

(Scene cuts to a close up of Sokka and Suki. She grabs him by the collar
and shakes him.)

Suki: (threateningly) A bunch of girls, huh? The unagi&#x27;s gonna eat well
tonight.
Katara: (quickly) No, don&#x27;t hurt him! He didn&#x27;t mean it. My brother is
just an idiot sometimes.
Aang: (apologetically) It&#x27;s my fault. I&#x27;m sorry we came here. I wanted to
ride the elephant koi.

(Scene cuts to a wide shot of Oyagi flanked by four of the female
warriors. The houses of the village can be seen in the background.)

Oyagi: (pointing at Aang accusingly) How do we know you&#x27;re not Fire Nation
spies? Kyoshi stayed out of the war so far. And we intend to keep it that
way!

(Scene cuts to a close up of Aang. His face is a mixture of surprise and
interest.)

Aang: This island is named for Kyoshi? I know Kyoshi!
Oyagi: Ha! How could you possibly know her? Avatar Kyoshi was born here
four hundred years ago. She&#x27;s been dead for centuries.

(The camera pans up the pole Aang, Sokka, and Katara are tied to as he
speaks, which turns out to be the base Avatar Kyoshi&#x27;s statue. She is
dressed in the same green garments as the female warriors who captured
Aang, Sokka, and Katara. Her face is painted white and there are two open
fans in her hands. Scene cuts back to a close up of Aang. He looks down
toward the ground and then back at Oyagi.)

Aang: I know her because I&#x27;m the Avatar.

(Scene cuts to Suki, the warriors, and Oyagi. His face shows shock and
disbelief.)

Suki: (shaking her fist at Aang) That&#x27;s impossible! The last Avatar was an
airbender who disappeared a hundred years ago.

(Scene cuts back to the trio tied to the base of the statue. Aang grins
widely.)

Aang: That&#x27;s me!

(Scene cuts back Oyagi and Suki.)

Oyagi: Throw the imposter to the unagi!

(Oyagi walks off screen. The female warriors assume a fighting stance.
Each warrior has two open fans in her hands. The four warriors move
menacingly toward the helpless trio. Scene cuts to a close up of Katara&#x27;s
face.)

Katara: (tersely) Aang... do some airbending...

(Scene cuts to a wide shot of the pole and approaching warriors. Aang
breaks his bonds and shoots himself into the air. He backflips over the
top of Kyoshi&#x27;s statue. The camera follows him as he floats gracefully to
the ground amidst the &#x27;oohs&#x27; and &#x27;aahs&#x27; of the gathered crowd, which now
includes other members of the village. POV is from behind Aang. Suki and
her warriors gaze in shock and amazement at Aang.)

Oyagi: It&#x27;s true... you are the Avatar!

(Scene cuts to Aang with a serious look on his face. In the background to
his left Sokka and Katara are still tied to the statue base. Aang,
realizing that he now has an audience, pulls the marble out from under his
shirt.)

Aang: Now... check this out!

(Grinning like a fool, he does the same trick he had tried to impress
Katara with earlier in the episode.)

(Scene cuts to the villagers cheering and jumping for joy. The villager
toward the front right screams like a girl and gets so excited that he
begins to foam at the mouth. He faints and falls forward toward the
camera.)

(The scene cuts to a small girl running eagerly across a pier to a
fisherman who is lifting his catch out of the water in a conical basket.)

Little Girl: Did you hear the news? The Avatar&#x27;s on Kyoshi!

Fisherman: (drops his basket of fish in shock and surprise.) HUH? (He
quickly picks his basket up again.)

(Here the information grapevine montage begins. Scene cuts to a small
street in the village. The fisherman from the previous scene hands his
basket of fish to a merchant. You see his lips move as he reports the news
that the Avatar is on Kyoshi. The scene cuts to the merchant in front of
his shop. The shop is along the water. The merchant is selling a fish to a
man. You can see his lips moving as he reports the news that the Avatar is
on Kyoshi to his customer, who from his clothes appears to be Fire Nation.
The scene fades to the interior of Zuko&#x27;s quarters. The customer who
purchased the fish from the merchant turns out to be Zuko&#x27;s cook. He is
serving the cooked fish to Zuko and Iroh. He kneels down to place the dish
on the table. Scene switches to a close up of Zuko&#x27;s face.)

Zuko: (standing up and speaking angrily) The Avatar&#x27;s on Kyoshi Island?
(Zuko walks out of the room while speaking to Iroh.) Uncle, ready the
rhinos. He&#x27;s not getting away from me this time.

(Switch to a wide view of Iroh sitting at the dinner table with the
steaming hot plate of fish in front of him. Zuko walks off screen. Iroh
turns towards him and, pointing at the fish, begins to speak.)

Iroh: Are you going to finish that?

(Zuko walks angrily back on camera to the dinner table and grabs the fish
off of the table.)

Zuko: I was going to save it for later! (He storms off screen with his
meal.)

(Iroh crosses his arms in annoyance and pouts at not getting to eat the
fish. Scene fades to black for commercial.)

Act II

(Scene opens with a close up of the face of Avatar Kyoshi&#x27;s statue. The
camera pans out to show two villagers attending to the statue. One is
painting a fresh coat of color on her face and the other is scrubbing the
dirt from the back. The camera pans down the statue and to the village. It
is morning and there are only a few villagers on the main street.
Everything is peaceful and quiet in the sunlight.)

(Scene cuts to Appa. He is lying on his side munching on fresh hay. Two
villagers are caring for him. One villager scrubs his fur and another is
buffing Appa&#x27;s horns. Appa grunts happily and is clearly enjoying all the
attention. The camera pans up to the windows of the house behind Appa.
Scene cuts to Momo, Aang, and Katara seated in front of a long wooden
table. The table is covered with eighteen different plates of food. A
villager enters and places another plate on the table and exits. Aang
throws his arms up in the air happily.)

Aang: All right! Dessert for breakfast! (stuffing his face and talking
with his mouth full) These people sure know how to treat an Avatar!

(Camera view switches to a frontal shot of Aang and Katara eating
breakfast. They are seated in front of a large window, which is propped
open to show the mountain in the background. Also in view are the two
villagers actively refurbishing the statue of Avatar Kyoshi.)

Aang: Mmm... Katara you&#x27;ve got to try these! (Aang offers Katara a sweet)
Katara: Well, maybe just a bite... (She takes the candy from Aang as Momo
seizes the opportunity and snatches another from his other hand.)
Aang: (looking off screen) Sokka, what&#x27;s your problem? EAT!
(Scene cuts to a very disgruntled Sokka sitting hunched and glowering in
the corner of the room.)

Sokka: Not hungry.

(Camera view switches to a close up of Aang&#x27;s face as he peers around
Katara&#x27;s head. He is shocked.)

Aang: But you&#x27;re always hungry!

(Cut to a long shot of the room. Aang and Katara at the breakfast table
are in the forefront. Sokka is in the back of the shot.)

Katara: He&#x27;s just upset because a bunch of girls kicked his butt
yesterday.
Sokka: They snuck up on me!
Katara: (smugly) Right. And then they kicked your butt.
Sokka: (getting up angrily) Sneak attacks don&#x27;t count! (pacing around the
room, gesticulating wildly to the air) Tie me up with ropes! I&#x27;ll show
them a thing or two. I&#x27;m not scared of any girls. (He has paced around to
the breakfast table and is ferociously grabbing sweets off it. He begins
to lower his voice and talk to himself.) Who do they think they are
anyway? (Sokka grunts and shoves a sweet into his mouth. He walks off
camera and out of the room.) Mmm... this is tasty.

(Camera switches back to the same frontal shot of Aang and Katara at the
table.)

Aang: What&#x27;s he so angry about? It&#x27;s great here. They&#x27;re giving us the
royal treatment.
Katara: Hey, don&#x27;t get too comfortable. It&#x27;s risky for us to stay in one
place for very long.
Aang: I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll be fine. Besides, did you see how happy I&#x27;m making
this town? (Aang turns around to look out the window at the two villagers
working on Avatar Kyoshi&#x27;s statue.) They&#x27;re even cleaning up that statue
in my honor!
Katara: Well, it&#x27;s nice to see you excited about being the Avatar. I just
hope it doesn&#x27;t all go to your head.
Aang: Come on, you know me better than that. I&#x27;m just a simple monk.

(Aang stands up and goes to the window. He looks down in surprise and
confusion as the scene cuts to the courtyard from Aang&#x27;s perspective. The
courtyard is full of little girls from the village, screaming and cheering
at him. Scene cuts back to Aang and Katara at the window. Aang&#x27;s face
breaks out in a large smile and he blushes. Katara, standing slightly
behind him, crosses her arms, sticks her tongue out and makes a long,
exasperated raspberry.)

(Scene cuts to a bright red bridge over a small stream. The quiet of the
scene is interrupted as Aang runs back and forth over the bridge while
being hotly pursued by the pack of young village girls. The group ends up
splitting and coming at him from both sides of the bridge as he stands in
the middle of it. Aang jumps high in the air and off camera as the groups
merge together beneath him, waiting for him to come back down. The camera
moves upward to reveal what&#x27;s taking him so long: he has his arms wrapped
around a spinning ball of air. It dissipates and he falls into the arms of
the crowd below.)

(After this &quot;Meet the Beatles&quot; type shenanigans, the scene cuts to Aang
standing next to Koko, one of the young girls from the village. An artist
puts up his paintbrush next to them as a reference for painting the scene.
He lifts his paper to begin his ink painting, covering the spot where Aang
and Koko are standing.)

Artist: (to himself while he paints) Painting the Avatar... that&#x27;s easy
enough...

(He drops his parchment for another look and now there are two girls
standing with Aang.)

Artist: Oh... there&#x27;s another one... I&#x27;ll make an adjustment here, and...

(When he drops his painting now, there are four girls standing around
Aang.)

Artist: There&#x27;s more... what...

(Now when he views the scene it appears that every girl in the village has
joined the group. The Camera gives a close up of the artist&#x27;s face. He has
a look of utter disbelief and irritation. Cut back to the group as they
all crowd in close to Aang and laugh while he has something of a horrified
expression on his face. After surveying the scene for a few seconds, the
artist gets up from his stool and walks away. The girls collapse on top of
Aang into a laughing pile.)

(Scene cuts to a frontal shot of Aang doing push ups in front of six of
the girls. Momo is sitting on his back. The girls are staring down at him
in rapt admiration. Aang begins to do one handed push ups. Then, he puts
both hands behind his back and uses his breath to push himself up off the
ground. The camera switches to a side view of Aang and the girls while he
is still doing airbending push ups with his breath. Katara walks past them
carrying a basket, rolling her eyes.)

(Scene cuts to small house nestled in evergreen trees. Sokka approaches
the house muttering to himself about &quot;girls.&quot; He walks up to the door and
looks inside. The fan warriors are drilling. Camera switches to a close up
of Sokka&#x27;s face from around the doorway. He grins, puts up his hands, and
enters the dojo.)

Sokka: (in a bit of an arrogant manner) Sorry ladies! Didn&#x27;t mean to
interrupt your dance lesson. (He stretches his arms and waist.) I was just
looking for somewhere to get a little workout? (He bends over and grabs
his knees with his hands.)
Suki: Well, you&#x27;re in the right place.

(There&#x27;s a long shot of the dojo to show the entire area and all the
people inside it. Sokka continues to stretch in front of the female
warriors.)

Suki: (sincerely) Sorry about yesterday. I didn&#x27;t know that you were
friends with the Avatar.
Sokka: (flippantly) It&#x27;s all right. I mean, normally I&#x27;d hold a grudge,
but seeing as you guys are a bunch of girls, I&#x27;ll make an exception. (He
rotates his shoulders.)
Suki: (with sarcasm) I should hope so. A big strong man like you? We
wouldn&#x27;t stand a chance.
Sokka: True. But don&#x27;t feel bad. After all, I&#x27;m the best warrior in my
village.
Suki: (leaning towards Sokka and smiling) Wow! Best warrior, huh? In your
whole village? Maybe you&#x27;d be kind enough to give us a little
demonstration.
Sokka: Oh... well... I mean... I...
Suki: (turning to her warriors) Come on, girls! Wouldn&#x27;t you like him to
show us some moves?

(The camera show the group of warriors, giggling and nodding affirmatively
at Suki&#x27;s suggestion. The scene switches back to Sokka and Suki. Sokka
turns and walks towards her.)

Sokka: Well, if that&#x27;s what you want, I&#x27;d be happy to. All right, you
stand over there. (He grasps her shoulders and pushes her back a little,
but Suki doesn&#x27;t move. He doesn&#x27;t seem to notice or care.) This may be a
little tough, but try to block me.

(Sokka throws a punch. Suki blocks it with a deft thrust of her fan to his
shoulder. Her stance is disinterested and confident against Sokka&#x27;s
arrogance.)

Sokka: (rubbing his shoulder) Heh heh... good. Of course, I was going easy
on you.
Suki: Of course.
Sokka: Let&#x27;s see if you can handle this!

(Sokka lunges at Suki. She catches him under his leg and tosses backward
toward the door. He lands on his butt.)

Sokka: (angrily) That does it!

(Sokka gets up and lunges again at Suki. She grabs him by the arm, spins
him around in circles, ties his arm to his foot with his own belt, and
throws him to the floor.)

Suki: (standing over Sokka laughing) Anything else you want to teach us?

(Sokka&#x27;s face flushes in humiliation as all the warriors laugh at him.)

(Scene opens with a long shot of the village. The statue of Avatar Kyoshi
is in the foreground. The camera zooms in on Aang and the cluster of girls
at its base as they stare up at it.)

Aang: There she is, girls. Me in a past life.
Girls: Ooohhh...
Koko: You were pretty!
Aang: Excuse me for a second, ladies.

(Scene cuts to Katara in the market place filling a basket with
vegetables. Aang approaches her and taps her on the shoulder.)

Katara: (turning around) Oh, good! Can you help me carry this back to the
room? It&#x27;s a little heavy.
Aang: Actually, I can&#x27;t right now.
Katara: (irritated) What do you mean you can&#x27;t?
Aang: I promised the girls that I&#x27;d give them a ride on Appa. Why don&#x27;t
you come with us? It&#x27;ll be fun!
Katara: (continuing to pick up vegetables) Watching you show off for a
bunch of girls does not sound like fun.
Aang: Well, neither does carrying your basket.
Katara: It&#x27;s not my basket. These supplies are for our trip. I told you,
we have to leave Kyoshi soon.
Aang: I don�t want to leave Kyoshi yet. I can&#x27;t put my finger on it, but
there&#x27;s something I really like about this place.

(Camera pans from a close up of Aang to the group of girls who have been
following him around all day. They giggle.)

Koko: (stomping her foot in annoyance and putting her hands on her hips)
What&#x27;s taking you so long, Aangy?
Katara: (flatly) Aangy...
Aang: (calling back) Just a second, Koko!
Katara: &#x27;Simple monk,&#x27; huh? I thought you promised me that this Avatar
stuff wouldn&#x27;t go to your head.
Aang: It didn&#x27;t. You know what I think? You just don&#x27;t want to come
because you&#x27;re jealous.
Katara: Jealous? Of what?
Aang: Jealous that we&#x27;re having so much fun without you.
Katara: (ferociously putting vegetables into her basket) That&#x27;s
ridiculous.
Aang: It is a little ridiculous, but I understand.

(Katara looks angrily at Aang as they stand framed by the vegetable stand.
She groans loudly, picks up the basket, and walks away from him. Aang
watches her go as the giggling girls drag him off camera in the other
direction.)

(Scene opens with Sokka kicking a stone outside of the fan warrior&#x27;s dojo.
He walks cautiously to the door. Suki and her warriors are training again,
but stop when they see Sokka walk in.)

Sokka: (hesitantly) Uh... hey, Suki.
Suki: (mockingly) Hoping for another dance lesson?
Sokka: No... I... well, let me explain.
Suki: Spit it out! What do you want?
Sokka: (kneeling in humility) I would be honored if you would teach me.
Suki: Even if I&#x27;m a girl?
Sokka: (quietly) I&#x27;m sorry if I insulted you earlier. I was wrong.
Suki: We normally don&#x27;t teach outsiders, let alone boys.
Sokka: Please make an exception. I won&#x27;t let you down.
Suki: All right. But you have to follow all of our traditions.
Sokka: (quickly) Of course!
Suki: And I mean ALL of them.

(Scene cuts to Sokka in the full green dress and white face paint of the
fan warriors.)

Sokka: Do I really have to wear this? It feels a little... girly.
Suki: It&#x27;s a warrior&#x27;s uniform. You should be proud. (Camera pans down
Sokka&#x27;s body) The silk threads symbolizes the brave blood that flows
through our veins. The gold insignia represents the honor of the warrior&#x27;s
heart.
Sokka: (standing proudly) Bravery and honor.

(Aang walks by the door to the dojo. He turns and ducks his head in
smiling mischievously.)

Aang: (giggling and racing off) Hey Sokka! Nice dress!

(Scene ends with Sokka and Suki standing in front of the doorway. Sokka&#x27;s
momentary pride is visibly crushed by Aang&#x27;s barb. Suki is smiling at him
and enjoying his discomfort.)

(Scene opens with Katara practicing her waterbending in their room. A
plume of water rises and falls from a small bowl in front of her. Aang
enters the room and stands cockily in the doorway.)

Aang: Katara, remember how the unagi almost got me yesterday?
Katara: (without looking up from her bowl) Yeah.
Aang: Well, I&#x27;m gonna go ride it now. It&#x27;s gonna be REAL dangerous.
Katara: (still not looking up from her bowl) Good for you.
Aang: (surprised) You&#x27;re not going to stop me?
Katara: (still not looking up) Nope. Have fun.
Aang: (crossing his arms peevishly) I will.
Katara: Great.
Aang: I know it&#x27;s great.
Katara: I&#x27;m glad you know.
Aang: I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;re glad.
Katara: Good!
Aang: Fine!

(Aang turns to storm angrily out of the room. He pauses at the door and
turns his head back to look at Katara. She is still intent on her
waterbending and does not look up at him. His face falls and he walks out
the door. Just as he is off camera, Katara lets the water fall back into
the bowl, crosses her arms, and looks at the door through which Aang has
just exited.)

(Scene cuts back to the dojo. Suki and Sokka are circling each other with
fans unfurled.)

Suki: You&#x27;re not going to master it in one day. Even I&#x27;m not that good.
Sokka: (slightly losing his balance) I think I&#x27;m starting to get it.

(Sokka continues to practice the moves, and at the end of the set he
accidentally throws his fan out the door and into a tree. Suki looks out
the door at the lost fan as snow falls from the branches above to bury
it.)

Suki: (turning and walking towards Sokka) It&#x27;s not about strength. Our
technique is about using your opponents&#x27; force against them. Loosen up.
Think of the fan as an extension of your arm. (Suki assumes the battle
stance. The camera changes to an intense close up of Sokka&#x27;s determined
face.) Wait for an opening and then...

(Suki lunges at Sokka and he parries the thrust, knocking her off her
feet. She shows her surprise and embarrassment as she looks up from her
spot on the floor.)

Sokka: (crossing his arms in a &quot;so there&quot; manner) Hmm...
Suki: (getting to her feet, flustered) I fell on purpose to make you feel
better!
Sokka: (laughing and pointing his finger at her) I got you! Admit I got
you!
Suki: (laughing as she grabs Sokka&#x27;s outstretched hand and bends it back
painfully) Okay, it was a lucky shot. Let&#x27;s see if you can do it again.

(Suki lets Sokka&#x27;s hand go and they assume battle positions. They begin to
circle each other. Scene cuts to Aang in the middle of the bay looking
towards shore at his fan club. On closer inspection, all of the girls
sitting on shore appear to be very bored.)

Koko: (impatiently) What&#x27;s taking so long?
Aang: I&#x27;m sure it will be here any second! (He looks down at the water.)
What about this? (Aang suspends and spins the marble between his two
hands.)
Little Girl: Not that again. Boring.
Koko: Where&#x27;s the unagi? It&#x27;s getting late.

(The girls begin to get up and leave. Camera view changes to a close up of
Aang alone in the water as he shouts and waves to the girls.)

Aang: Where&#x27;re you going? Don&#x27;t leave!
Koko: Sorry, Aang! Maybe next time.

(As the last of the girls leaves, Katara walks onto the beach.)

Aang: (excitedly waving) Katara! You came!
Katara: I wanted to make sure you were safe. You really had me worried.
Aang: Back there you acted like you didn�t care.
Katara: I&#x27;m sorry.
Aang: Me too. I did let all that attention go to my head. I was being a
jerk.
Katara: (affectionately) Well, get out of the water before you catch a
cold, you big jerk!
Aang: (grinning widely as he begins to swim toward shore) On my way!

(As Aang swims towards land, the unagi comes up behind him and catches him
in its wake. As the unagi rises from the water, Aang is kneeling on a
portion of its tail. Cut to commercial break.)

Act III

(The unagi raises its head and spews a powerful jet of water directly at
Aang. He leaps up and grabs hold of one of the unagi&#x27;s whiskers. The unagi
shakes its head back and forth in an attempt to dislodge Aang. POV changes
to a shot from inside the unagi&#x27;s mouth as Aang swings back and forth in
front of the sharp fangs. Saliva drips from the unagi&#x27;s teeth and it wets
its lips with its tongue.)

Katara: (calling from the shore) Hang on, Aang!

(The unagi continues to shake its head and Aang is thrown into the water.
He is unconscious as he comes to the surface. Both the unagi and Katara
rush towards him. Katara reaches Aang first and takes him into her arms
just as the unagi raises itself from the water. She pushes the water
forcefully in front of her and propels both herself and Aang away from the
unagi. The unagi dives into the water and the force of its dive sends Aang
and Katara flying into a small cavern. Angrily, the unagi shoots water
from its mouth and eventually sinks back into the bay. Katara peers over
the side of the opening and sees Prince Zuko&#x27;s ship approaching the
island.)

Katara: Zuko!

(Zuko&#x27;s ship lands. The prow is let down and Zuko rides out of the hull on
the back of a war rhinoceros. He is accompanied by many men also on on
rhino mounts.

Zuko: I want the Avatar alive.

(Katara hides Aang in the cave as Zuko and his army march towards Kyoshi.
Aang is still unconscious.)

Katara: Wake up, Aang!

(Katara moves her hands up Aang&#x27;s chest and draws the water out of his
lungs. Aang coughs and sputters.)

Aang: (weakly) Katara... don&#x27;t ride the unagi. Not fun.

(Scene cuts to the warrior&#x27;s dojo. Suki and Sokka are sparring. He parries
a thrust and they both smile.)

Suki: Not bad.

(Oyagi runs to the door of the dojo, breathless.)

Oyagi: Firebenders have landed on our shores! Girls, come quickly!
Sokka: Hey, I&#x27;m not a... oh, whatever!

(Scene cuts to Zuko entering the town. The streets are deserted. The
camera pans from the far end of town to a close up of Zuko&#x27;s face.)

Zuko: Come out, Avatar! You can&#x27;t hide from me forever! (to his men) Find
him.

(Zuko&#x27;s army begins to search the town for Aang. The camera follows the
three war rhinos as they proceed down the main street of the village.
Scene cuts to a close up of an unfurling fan. Scene cuts again to a long
distance shot of the firebenders continuing down the street.)

(A green form rushes silently past the camera. The fan warriors attack
Zuko&#x27;s army. Suki heads directly for Zuko. As she is about to land on him,
he turns his rhinoceros and she is swatted out of the air by its tail. As
she hits the ground, Zuko aims a fire blast at her. Sokka steps in between
Suki and the fire ball, deflecting it. Zuko, taken by surprise, falls off
his rhinoceros.)

Sokka: I guess training&#x27;s over.

(Suki, Sokka, and another warrior cautiously approach the prone Zuko. Zuko
spins around on his hands shooting fire bolts out of his feet at the
approaching warriors. He knocks them all to the ground and pulls himself
to his feet. Zuko leaps to the middle of the street.)

Zuko: Nice try, Avatar! But these little girls can&#x27;t save you.
Aang: Hey! Over here!
Zuko: Finally!

(Zuko and Aang face each other, &quot;High Noon&quot; style. Zuko lets loose three
consecutive fire balls from his hands. Aang dodges them and, using his
staff as a helicopter, flies toward Zuko. Zuko shoots another blast of
fire, which knocks Aang&#x27;s staff out of his hands. Aang leaps away and
picks up two discarded fans. Zuko runs full force at Aang. Aang uses the
fans to throw an enormous gust of air at Zuko. The air knocks Zuko through
the wall of a building. Aang drops the fans and picks up his staff. He
throws it into the air and flies over the now burning town. He looks
behind him to see the statue of Avatar Kyoshi engulfed in flames. He lands
next to Katara, who is helping a small child inside.)

Katara: Get inside.
Aang: (upset) Look what I brought to this place.
Katara: It&#x27;s not your fault.
Aang: Yes, it is. These people got their town destroyed trying to protect
me.
Katara: Then let&#x27;s get out of here. Zuko will leave Kyoshi to follow us. I
know it feels wrong to run, but I think it&#x27;s the only way.
Aang: (hanging his head) I&#x27;ll call Appa.

(Scene cuts to a fan warrior battling a firebender. She throws her fan
directly at his face mask and knocks him unconscious. Scene cuts again to
Sokka and Suki crouching behind a house.)

Suki: There&#x27;s no time to say goodbye.
Sokka: What about, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry&quot;?
Suki: For what?
Sokka: I treated you like a girl when I should have treated you like a
warrior.
Suki: (leaning towards Sokka) I am a warrior. (She kisses him on the
cheek.) But I&#x27;m a girl, too. (Sokka touches his hand to his cheek, his
eyes wide with surprise, and blushes.) Now get out of here! We&#x27;ll hold
them off.

(Sokka runs up Appa&#x27;s tail. Katara, Aang, and Momo are waiting for him.)

Aang: Appa, yip yip!

(Appa grunts and flies out of the town. Zuko sees them leaving.)

Zuko: (to his men) Back to the ship! Don&#x27;t lose sight of them!

(Camera view changes to Appa flying away from the burning town. Katara and
Sokka are sitting in the saddle on Appa&#x27;s back. Aang is sitting behind
Appa&#x27;s head with the reins in his hands. His head is hanging down; he is
clearly upset. Katara leans forward to speak to him.)

Katara: I know it&#x27;s hard, but you did the right thing. Zuko would have
destroyed the whole place if we had stayed. They&#x27;re going to be okay,
Aang.

(Without a word, Aang suddenly dives off of Appa&#x27;s head into the bay, a
determined expression on his face.)

Katara: (as he dives off) What are you doing?!

(Katara and Sokka watch in horror as Aang disappears under the water. A
close up of the water&#x27;s surface shows concentric rings Aang&#x27;s dive has
created. Several seconds go by before the unagi bursts out of the water,
Aang riding on it. He has hold of both whiskers and forces the unagi&#x27;s
head towards the burning town of Kyoshi. Aang pulls back on the whiskers
and the unagi spews water over the town. The stream continues long enough
to put out the fires Zuko and his army had begun. A closer shot of the
town shows it is now only smoldering. Camera switches to a shot of Zuko
and his now very wet army and then a close up of a very unhappy Zuko.)

(Scene cuts to Aang on the back of the unagi. He sees that Kyoshi is out
of danger and lets go of the unagi&#x27;s whiskers. The unagi rears its head
and Aang jumps into the air just as Appa swoops down. Appa catches Aang in
his front paws and flies off. Scene cuts to Oyagi looking at the departing
travelers through a window.)

Oyagi: (gratefully) Thank you, Avatar.

(Scene cuts to Aang climbing into Appa&#x27;s saddle. Katara, Sokka, and Momo
are sitting, waiting for him.)

Aang: (clearly expecting a lecture from Katara) I know, I know. That was
stupid and dangerous.
Katara: Yes, it was.

(Katara hugs Aang. Aang&#x27;s face lights up with joy and surprise. Scene
changes to the fin of the unagi swimming in the bay. The sun is setting.
All is calm and quiet. Fade to black.)

第四回
虚子武士

要是没有降世神通的消息就别来烦我
祖寇殿下, 消息倒是有，但是估计您不太想听
-是个令人沮丧的消息
-皇叔，你曾经教导我作为一个
优秀的领袖要有宽广的心胸
放心，现在不管您说什么，我都能接受
那么，好吧，这个...我们还不知道他在哪
-什么？！
-你真应该把窗户打开，让这里通通风
-把地图给我
-已经对降世神通去过的地方进行了盘查
但是我们发现完全没可能对神通进行跟踪
皇叔，我该怎么找到他呢
他的行踪完全没有规律可循
你都不知道我们该去哪吧，我没说错吧？
我知道咱们的目的地在水上
我想我们马上就到了
模模, 把弹球给我
嘿, 卡塔拉, 瞧瞧这个御气小戏法
-不错啊, 安昂.
-你连看都没看
-是不错啊
-我现在啥也没做啊
哎，你就别烦她了，女孩在缝纫的时候不喜欢被打搅
为啥当女孩就得缝纫？
很简单啊，女孩比男孩缝裤子要缝得好，男孩就比较擅长打猎、打仗啊之类的
这是起码的常识嘛
我已经缝完你的裤子了，看看吧，缝得可好了呢
不要吧，我刚才是开玩笑的，卡塔拉，你总不能让我这样穿出去吧
别担心，索卡, 咱们去的地方不用穿裤子
我们昨天刚刚修整完，今天应该多飞点好赶赶路
-他说得对，在这样下去，春天也到不了北极
-但是，阿柏已经累了，对吧，伙计
我是说，你累了吧, 伙计？
是啊，还真有说服力啊。没想到要和一个吨的怪兽讨价还价
看哪！
我们来这儿就是为了这些“象鱼“，卡塔拉，让你看看我是怎么骑象鱼的
好冷啊！！！
（他是秀逗了吧）
-看安昂骑得很棒呢！
-瞎掰呢吧，鱼游得好看跟他有什么关系
嘿, 阿柏，那东西不能吃
真扫兴
水里面好像有什么东西
-咋了？-安昂有麻烦了
-安昂！ -快回来！
快回来，安昂!
-那是啥东西？
-我也不知道
-别管那鬼东西是啥，赶紧赶路吧...
...小留一会儿，我也不太介意
-你们三个赶紧说明来历
-要是你们不老实，就把你们扔到水里去喂鳗鱼
懦夫，有种就让老子看看你们是谁
-你们是谁，伏击我们的男人们在哪？
-没有男人伏击你们，是我们做的
现在老实说，你们是谁，来这干嘛？
等等，我们不可能中了一群小姑娘的道儿
一群“小姑娘“？看来今晚鳗鱼有的吃了
等等，别伤害他，我哥哥有时候容易犯浑
对不起，是我的不是，我们不该来这，我只想骑骑“象鱼“
我们怎么知道你们不是火国奸细。
虚子岛一直得以远离战争，我们可不想卷进去
这个岛叫虚子岛？我认识虚子
哈，竟说笑，你咋能认识她，神通虚子出生于年前
她都去世了几百年了
我认识她，因为我就是降世神通
那不可能，最后一任降世神通是个御气师，年前他就消失了
-你说的就是我喽
-把这帮人给我扔进水里喂鳗鱼
安昂，亮两招御气术啊!
是真的啊，你就是降世神通
现在，再让你们瞧瞧这个（~ ~|||）
-你听说了吗，降世神通来虚子岛了
-啊？
（于是一传十，十传百，终于成为了全球皆知的秘密）
降世神通在虚子岛上？皇叔，准备好战船，这会不会再让他跑了
-这个你不吃了吧？
-我一会儿会解决掉它的
好了，开始吃早餐了，呵呵，这群人真的知道该怎样侍奉降世神通
-卡塔拉, 来常常这个
-好吧，就尝一小口
索卡, 愣着干嘛？吃啊
-我-不-饿
-这可不像你啊
-他只是不爽昨天被一群女孩收拾了
-她们偷袭我
没错啊，然后她们好好的收拾了你一顿
偷袭不算数，还敢绑我，让我教训教训她们
我才不怕那些小丫头片子呢，她们以为自己是谁啊？
嗯，是挺好吃的
-他生什么气嘛，在这里待着多好
-别太懈怠了，在一个地方呆太长时间会很危险
我们一定会没事的，你看我在这，镇上人都很快乐，她们甚至清洁了虚子的塑像
你愿意做回降世神通，我很替你高兴，只是不希望你被高兴冲昏了头脑
你还不了解我吗，我只是个简单的小和尚
给神通画像...这很容易
哦，又多了一个...好吧，那就调整一下
哦，越来越多了
对不起啦，各位女士，打扰了你们的舞蹈课
我只是想找个人活动活动筋骨
那你可是来对地方了
昨天对不住了，我不知道你是降世神通的朋友
没关系。一般人我都不让着他们，可你们是女孩，可以给些例外
真是受宠若惊啊，像你这么高大威猛，我们怎么会是你的对手呢
话是这么说，不过也不要难过嘛，我可是我们村里最厉害的武士
是你们村最好的武士呢？！不如你跟我们做几个示范动作，教我们俩招
-噢，我的意思是...
-对吧，姐妹们，让她教我们几招
好吧，既然你们坚持，就给你们露一小手
你就站在这儿，可能这有点困难，试着防我
-不错啊，是我给你放水了
-那可不是嘛
再尝尝这招
你居然来真的
还想教我们点啥啊?
看吧，姑娘们，这就是我的前世
你过去可真漂亮
女士们，请恕我失陪一下
你来得正是时候，你能帮我把这些送回屋吗，有点沉
-抱歉，现在帮不了你
-为啥？
我答应带姑娘们去骑阿柏，一起来吧，会很好玩的
看你跟一群姑娘炫耀，可不是什么好玩的事
-你是想让我帮你搬这些
-不是帮我，这是我们今后路上吃的口粮
-我跟你说过，我们得快点离开虚子岛
-我还不想离开，这里有些说不出的东西吸引着我
你在磨蹭些什么啊，小安安
-小安安？（好麻呀）
-就来，可可
真是简单的小和尚啊！我记得你曾向我保证，降世神通的头衔不会冲昏你的头脑
我没有啊，你知道我怎么想吗？你不愿意跟来，是因为你嫉妒
-嫉妒？嫉妒什么？
-嫉妒我们没有你也可以玩得很开心
-真是不可理喻啊
-你的想法是有不可理喻，不过也是可以理解的
嗯，嘿，苏琪
还想上上舞蹈课吗？
-嗯，那个，我是想说..
-有话快说
你想干什么？
如果可以的话，我想拜你为师
-即便我是个女孩？
-我对之前说过的错话道歉
-我错了
-我们从不教外人武功，更别说是教男孩
请破个例吧，我不会让你失望的
-那好吧，但是你得完全遵守我们的门规
-那当然
-我可是说全部要遵守
我真的必须要穿成这样吗，这看起来太女气了
这是武士的盔甲，你应该为此感到自豪。
丝线象征着勇士血管中流淌的热血
金色的徽章象征着武者之心的尊严
勇敢而庄重
嘿，索卡, 裙子挺漂亮啊
嘿，卡塔拉，记得昨天差点抓到我的那个鳗鱼吗
-记得
-我现在要去骑骑它，那可会很危险呦
-不错啊。-你不阻止我吗？
-不会。
-好好玩吧。-我会的
.....吵来吵去，吵来吵去......
你不可能在一天之内就掌握所有招式
即便是我也不行
我想我开始找到窍门了
并不是要用蛮力
这是一种借力打力的功夫
手臂要放松，把扇子看成是手臂的延长
找到破绽，然后...
我是故意这么做好让你有点成就感
我赢你了，真的，我赢你了刚才
好吧，刚才算你运气好，再来，看看你是不是有真功夫
都等了这么长时间了
我保证它可能随时就来
给你们表演这个看看怎么样
咋又是这玩艺，真无聊
哪有鳗鱼的影儿啊，都这么晚了
你们要去哪啊，别走啊
抱歉了，安昂, 下回有机会再说吧
卡塔拉, 你终于来了
我想确定一下你是否安全
我很为你担心
但是当时你好像并不在意
-我很抱歉
-我也是
我一时头脑发热作了那些错事
我真是个傻瓜
那还在水里待着干嘛，大傻瓜，别感冒了
我这就上来了
安昂, 抓住了
安昂!
坏了, 祖寇来了
给我活捉降世神通
快醒醒啊, 安昂
卡塔拉
千万别骑鳗鱼啊，一点也不好玩
不错嘛
火宗人 在我们的海滩上登陆了
姑娘们，快跟我来，该战斗了
嘿，我才不是（姑娘）...哎，随便吧
降世神通，快滚出来，你不可能永远躲着我
把他给我找出来
我看我们训练结束了
这些小妞身手不错啊，可惜她们救不了你
嘿，大爷在此
终于出现了
快进去
-看我给这个村子带来了什么
-这不是你的错
这是我的错，村民们为了保护我而舍弃了自己的村子
我们应该离开这，祖寇会跟我们离开，村子就安全了
我知道就这样逃走很不好，但这是唯一的方法
我这就去叫阿柏
没有时间告别了
我只想向你说抱歉
-抱歉什么？
-我应是你为一个武士，而不是一个女孩
我是一个武士，但，我也是个女孩
快走吧，我来帮你拖住他们
阿柏, 走啦，走啦
赶紧追上他们，别跟丢了
我知道这很难接受，但是你作了正确的决定
如果我们再留在那里，祖寇会毁了整个村子
他们会没事的
你这是要干嘛？
谢谢你，降世神通
我知道，我知道，那么做既愚蠢，又危险
是啊，没错
-=未完待续=-

水善国
土强国
火烈国
气和国
很久以前，这四大国和谐共处
然而，火国发起的战争结束了和平
只有同时掌握四种元素的将世神通才能结束战争
然而在大家最需要他的时候，他却消失了
年后，我和哥哥发现了新的降世神通，
他是个御气师，名叫安昂
尽管他的御气术着实厉害
在拯救苍生之前，他要学的还有很多
但是我坚信安昂能拯救这个世界
