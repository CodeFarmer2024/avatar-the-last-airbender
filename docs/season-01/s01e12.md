      Scene I

      (The scene begins in a dream sequence. The animation is slightly fuzzy and
      the sky is a peculiar cream color. We see Aang shaking Appa&#x27;s reigns,
      smiling. Cut to a wide shot of Aang on Appa. The screen pans right to show
      Sokka flying gracefully on Aang&#x27;s glider. Close up of Sokka, smiling at
      Aang, whom we see smiling at Sokka in return. Aang looks over to his right
      to see Katara flying on an enormous version of Momo. She waves at him. Cut
      to shot of all three flying towards the camera.)

      Katara: We need you, Aang.
      Aang: I need you too.

      (Aang turns from Katara to look straight ahead in alarm. A huge, black
      storm cloud has gathered ahead. Cut back to Aang.)

      Aang: Be careful guys! Guys?

      (He looks from side to side in surprise. The shot widens to reveal that
      Sokka and Katara have disappeared. Cut to a shot from Aang&#x27;s p.o.v, he is
      approaching the storm quickly. Suddenly, a cross-legged Monk Gyatso drops
      from the top of the frame to rest just above Appa&#x27;s head.)

      Aang: Gyatso?
      Gyatso: Why did you disappear?
      Aang: I didn&#x27;t mean to.

      (Cut to side view as Aang leans forward to touch his old master, but
      before he can Gyatso turns grey as ash and begins to blow away starting
      from the head down. Soon he is gone. After Gyatso disintegrates, the
      camera cuts to a wide, side shot of Aang and Appa entering the storm
      clouds.)

      Gyatso (from o.c.): We need you, Aang.

      (Inside the cloud, lightning illuminates the sky. It is pouring rain and
      Aang screams as he holds on to Appa for his life. Appa and Aang plunge
      into the sea in a replay of his accident a century ago. Aang relinquishes
      his hold on Appa and begins to drift away in the water.)

      Many Voices: We need you, Aang. We need you.

      (At the end of the last sentence a vision of the Fire Lord, wreathed in
      flame, is visible for an instant in the afterglow of a lightning strike.
      At this horrifying vision Aang wakes instantly from his dream with a
      start. It is night at their most recent camp. He disturbs Momo, who wakes
      up Katara and Sokka while trying to get away, Sokka ready with his knife
      and boomerang.)

      Sokka (groggily): Huh? Uh� what&#x27;s going on? Did we get captured again?
      Aang: It&#x27;s nothing, I just had a bad dream. Go back to sleep.
      Sokka: Don&#x27;t have to tell me twice.

      (Sokka rolls over back to sleep. Cut to Aang in a fetal position, looking
      pained.)

      Katara: Are you all right, Aang?
      Aang: I&#x27;m okay.
      Katara: You seem to be having a lot of nightmares lately, you wanna tell
      me about it?
      Aang: I think I just need some rest.
      Sokka (sits up, excited): You guys want to hear about my dream? (Silence,
      as Katara looks annoyed.) That&#x27;s ok, I didn&#x27;t wanna talk about it anyway.

      (Sokka and Katara lie back down to sleep. Fade to a day scene of a beach.
      Cut to Appa yawning and Katara packing for them to get under way. Aang
      sits atop Appa, and when the bison is done yawning Aang points to the
      heavens.)

      Aang: Look at those clear skies, buddy! Should be some smooth flying.
      Katara (examining empty food bag): Well, we better smoothly fly ourselves
      to a market, cause we&#x27;re out of food.
      Sokka (alarmed): Guys, wait, this was in my dream, we shouldn&#x27;t go to the
      market.
      Katara: What happened in your dream?

      (Cut to Sokka. His eyes are bugged out in fright, and camera zooms in on
      him and rotates slightly. The background turns a sickly green and an eerie
      sound effect is heard.)

      Sokka: Food eats people!

      (Cut to Katara and Aang who are not impressed, then back to Sokka with
      Momo on his right.)

      Sokka: Also, Momo could talk. (To Momo.) You said some very unkind things.

      (Cut to an overhead shot of the ocean. A flock of birds fly by as the
      screen pans left to reveal Prince Zuko&#x27;s ship steaming towards the
      southeast corner of the screen. Cut to the main deck where Iroh is
      sniffing the air in the foreground and Zuko is looking out of a telescope
      in the background.)

      Iroh: There is a storm coming. A big one.
      Zuko (lowering the telescope): You&#x27;re out of your mind, Uncle. The
      weather&#x27;s perfect. There is not a cloud in sight.
      Iroh: The storm is approaching from the north. I suggest we alter our
      course and head southwest.
      Zuko: We know the Avatar is traveling northward, so we will do the same.
      Iroh: Prince Zuko, consider the safety of the crew.
      Zuko: The safety of the crew doesn&#x27;t matter!

      (Zuko&#x27;s eyebrow goes up in concern as a crewmember enters from the left in
      the background. Cut to a close up of the Lieutenant, who has clearly
      overhead Zuko&#x27;s remark and is unhappy. Zuko, realizing this, begins to
      speak to the Lieutenant and walk up until his face is right in front of
      the Lieutenant&#x27;s.)

      Zuko: Finding the Avatar is far more important than any individual&#x27;s
      safety.

      (Zuko enters the ship and shuts the hatch behind him. Iroh stands next to
      the Lieutenant.)

      Iroh: He doesn&#x27;t mean that, he&#x27;s just all worked up.

      (Cut to a harbor scene, where Appa lies in the water next to one of the
      jetties as if he were a ship. The scene is quickly followed by a shot of
      Katara examining a fruit at a produce stand in the harbor. The shopkeeper
      is clearly exasperated at Katara&#x27;s suspicion of the fruit&#x27;s quality.)

      Shopkeeper: Ah, it&#x27;s good! It&#x27;s perfect, I&#x27;m telling you!

      (Katara shakes the fruit which makes a swishing sound.)

      Katara: I don&#x27;t know if I like the sound of that swishing.

      (The shopkeeper comes around the stand to face Katara. Aang and Sokka wait
      to the left of the produce stand. Sokka carries a basket of fruit.)

      Shopkeeper: Swishing means it&#x27;s ripe! It&#x27;s the ripe juices swishing
      around, eh?
      Aang: I think it&#x27;s true, Katara, swishing means it&#x27;s ripe.
      Katara (putting fruit back): I just realized we&#x27;re out of money anyway.
      Shopkeeper (grabbing basket from Sokka): Awww!

      (The shopkeeper kicks Sokka as he walks by. Cut to the dock, where the
      three stand, Sokka rubbing the sport where he was kicked. An old fisherman
      and his wife walk behind them in the background, the camera slowlu panning
      left to keep them in the frame longer.)

      Sokka (depressed): Out of food and out of money, now what are we supposed
      to do?
      Katara: You could get a job, smart guy.

      (In the background, the old woman grabs the old man by the shoulder. They
      begin a conversation amongst themselves, but overheard by Aang, Katara and
      Sokka.)

      Old Woman: We shouldn&#x27;t go out there! Please, the fish can wait. There&#x27;s
      going to be a terrible storm.
      Old Man: Ahh, you&#x27;re crazy! It&#x27;s a nice day. No clouds, no wind, no
      nothing, so quit you&#x27;re naggin&#x27; woman.

      Aang (to Katara and Sokka): Maybe we should find some shelter?
      Sokka: Are you kidding? Shelter from what?

      (The old man and woman continue their argument.)

      Old Woman: My joints say there&#x27;s going to be a storm! A bad one.
      Old Man: Well, it&#x27;s your joints against my brain.
      Old Woman: Then I hope your brain can find someone else to haul that fish,
      cause I ain&#x27;t comin!
      Old Man: Then I&#x27;ll find a new fish hauler and pay him double what you get!
      How do you like that?
      Sokka (running up to them): I&#x27;ll go!
      Old Man (pointing at Sokka): You&#x27;re hired!
      Sokka (to his friends): What? You said �get a job&#x27; and he&#x27;s paying double.
      Old Man (looking at Sokka as if he were an alien): Double? Who told ya
      that nonsense?

      (Cut to Zuko&#x27;s ship on the ocean, camera panning right to reveal the black
      edges of an ominous storm. Zuko&#x27;s ship is making straight for it. Cut to
      Zuko walking on deck. Four crewman, including the Lieutenant from before,
      are there looking at the storm clouds. The Lieutenant turns, folding his
      arms across his chest, to address the Prince.)

      Lieutenant Jee: Uh! Looks like your uncle was right about the storm after
      all.
      Iroh (entering from left): Lucky guess.
      Zuko (crossing to the Lieutenant): Lieutenant, you&#x27;d better learn some
      respect, (pointing at his chest with two fingers) or I will teach it to
      you.

      (Zuko walks past the Lieutenant, who can no longer contain his contempt
      for the Prince. As the Lieutenant speaks, Iroh is visible in the
      background making decapitation motions with his hand, trying to head off
      the conflict.)

      Lieutenant Jee: What do you know about respect? The way you talk to
      everyone around here, from your hard working crew to your esteemed uncle
      shows you know nothing about respect. You don&#x27;t care about anyone but
      yourself! Then again, what should I expect from a spoiled prince?

      (Zuko stops in mid step shortly into the Lieutenant&#x27;s speech. Iroh sighs
      and puts his hand over his face, resigning himself to the brewing
      disaster. By the end of the tirade, Prince Zuko&#x27;s eyebrow is twitching. He
      is clearly stung by the accusations. He turns and assumes a firebending
      stance, the Lieutenant follows suit.)

      Iroh (hands up in gesture of calming): Easy now.

      (Cut to Zuko and the Lieutenant&#x27;s hands crossing at the wrists, indicating
      that the ritual of combat has begun. When they cross, the sound of steel
      on steel is heard and smoke curls from where they meet. Iroh appears
      between them and breaks their wrists apart is neat movement.)

      Iroh: Enough! We are all a bit tired from being at sea so long. I&#x27;m sure
      after a bowl of noodles everyone will feel much better.

      (The Prince and the Lieutenant glare at each other a moment longer, then
      both turn and walk away in opposite directions.)

      Zuko (to Iroh): I don&#x27;t need your help keeping order on my ship.

      (Iroh places a hand on Zuko&#x27;s shoulder, but Zuko rudely shove him off.
      Zuko walks to the bow, where it is clear the storm clouds now fill the
      sky. Cut back to harbor where Appa still wallows in the water. Cut to Aang
      in the foreground, Sokka loading a fishing boat in the background. Aang
      looks worriedly at the sky, which is clearly full of black storm clouds.
      The wind has picked up as well.)

      Aang: Sokka, maybe this isn&#x27;t such a good idea. Look at the sky.
      Sokka: I said I was gonna do this job. I can&#x27;t back out just because of
      some bad weather.

      Old Woman (from o.c., then from wider shot of boat): The boy with the
      tattoos has some sense. You should listen to him!

      (Cut to close up of the old man as he puts down some boxes on the ship. A
      question forms in his mind.)

      Old Man: Boy with tattoos? (He turns to Aang and looks at him). Airbender
      tattoos�well I&#x27;ll be a hogmonkey&#x27;s uncle! You&#x27;re the Avatar, ain&#x27;t ya?

      (Cut to Aang with Katara close behind him to his left.)

      Katara (smiling, hands on hips): That&#x27;s right.
      Old Man: Well don&#x27;t be so smiley about it. The Avatar disappeared for a
      hundred years. (Jabbing Aang&#x27;s chest with his forefinger). You turned your
      back on the world!
      Katara (coming to Aang&#x27;s side, angry): Don&#x27;t yell at him! Aang would never
      turn his back on anyone!
      Old Man: Oh? He wouldn&#x27;t, uh? Then I guess I must have imagined the last
      hundred years of war and suffering.

      (As the Old Man makes this damning pronouncement, cut to Aang with the
      distorted camera effect of the world warping around him, a visual
      testimonial to the sickening guilt welling up within the Avatar. Cut to
      Katara stepping in front of Aang so that she is between him and the Old
      Man. She is irate.)

      Katara: Aang is the bravest person I know! He has done nothing but help
      people and save lives since I met him. It&#x27;s not his fault he disappeared,
      right Aang? Aang? What&#x27;s wrong?

      (Aang has been backing up while Katara has been telling off the old man.
      When she is finished, he flees, opening his glider and taking off towards
      the mountains.)

      Old Man: That&#x27;s right! Keep flyin!
      Katara: You&#x27;re a horrible old man!
      Old Man: Ehh.
      Katara (mounting Appa): Appa, yip! Yip!

      (Katara and Appa take off, drenching the old man. Sokka emerges from the
      hold just as the old man shakes off the excess water.)

      Sokka: Hey, they left without saying goodbye!
      Old Man: You&#x27;re friends ain&#x27;t too polite, are they?
      Sokka: I know! This one time I was�
      Old Man (handing Sokka a box): Yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, get below deck.

      (Fade to commercial break.)

      Scene II

      (When the show returns, the camera shows a longshot of Appa skirting a
      mountain face at high speed. The sky is now black with storm clouds and it
      is pouring rain. Cut to a closer shot of Katara in Appa&#x27;s �driver&#x27;s seat&#x27;,
      shielding her eyes as she searches for Aang in the rain. The shot swivels
      as Katara and Appa pass, showing a cave in the rock face with an exposed
      parapet and a stone staircase leading up to it from the shoreline below.
      Cut to a shot from the inside of the cave looking out where the storm is
      intensifying. Katara enters, wiping the water off her sleeves. She stands
      still, seeing something in front of her. The shot widens to show Aang in
      the foreground, farther back in the cave. He is sitting with his hands in
      his lap, looking downcast. He will not turn to look at Katara.)

      Aang: I&#x27;m sorry for running away.
      Katara: It&#x27;s ok. That fisherman was way out of line.
      Aang: Actually, he wasn&#x27;t.
      Katara: What do you mean?
      Aang: I don&#x27;t wanna talk about it.
      Katara: It has to do with your dream, doesn&#x27;t it?

      (Katara walks over to Aang, kneels by him and puts a hand on his
shoulder.)

      Katara: Talk to me.
      Aang: Well, it&#x27;s kind of a long story.

      (Suddenly, Momo runs back, chittering, and the sound of a huge animal is
      heard from behind Aang towards the cave entrance. Appa&#x27;s nose and bangs
      appear from the right, nudging Aang. Cut to a full shot towards the cave
      entrance, which is now completely plugged with a sopping Appa.)

      Katara: I&#x27;m gonna try to get a little fire going.

      (Aang strokes Appa&#x27;s chin, then cut to Katara stoking a little cheery fire
      on the right, Aang on the left with Momo in his lap. When Aang begins to
      speak the camera pans up and enters a dreamy flashback sequence.)

      Aang: I&#x27;ll never forget the day the monks told me I was the Avatar.

      (The pan up changes quickly from the rock of the cave to an outdoor shot
      of the Southern Air Temple in its heyday. A stone plaza is populated with
      many young airbenders playing games, a flying bison soars in the
distance.)

      Aang: I was playing with some other kids just outside the south wall. I
      was trying to teach them how to do the air scooter�

      (Cut to a shot of Aang addressing a group of young airbenders. Most seem
      Aang&#x27;s age or younger, one is taller and probably older. Aang demonstrates
      the air scooter move.)

      Aang: First, you form a ball. Then you gotta get on quick.

      (Aang makes an air ball and sits on it fast. He laughs and begins to move
      at terrific speed across the plaza. He goes upside down in a nearby
      archway under a walking bridge, then climbs a wall and gets up on to the
      bridge, coming back to the plaza by a nearby set of stairs. Aang exclaims
      �yeh!� and �woohoo!� as he travels. Cut to the older boy, who readies his
      own attempt.)

      Older Boy: Okay! Here goes! (He makes a ball.)
      Aang: Quick, get on!
      Older Boy: Wh, wh, whoaaaa! (He wobbles and is thrown.) Ugh!
      Aang (dismounting his own scooter): You kinda have to balance on it like
      it&#x27;s a top. (He twirls his finger to demonstrate.)
      Older Boy: Man, that&#x27;s hard.

      (A young boy enters the screen from the left and tugs at Aang&#x27;s shoulder.)

      Young Boy: Where&#x27;d ya learn that trick, Aang?
      Aang: I made it up.
      Young Boy (doing a goofy dance): Wow!

      (Screen pans left to show five elderly airbender monks on the stones steps
      leading up to the bridge. Monk Gyatso is one of them.)

      Monk Gyatso: Aang, come with us. We need to speak with you.

      (Cut to Aang, who obeys with a look of trepidation on his face, the other
      kids looking at him strangely. Cut to a chamber in the Air Temple where
      the five elder monks sit cross-legged and serene on five evenly spaced
      stools. The middle monk&#x27;s stool rests under an ornate parasol; he is
      likely the leader or abbot of the monastery. Monk Gyatso is the second
      from the left. Aang kneels in front of them, head down, his back to the
      camera. He lifts his head to address them.)

      Aang: How do you know it&#x27;s me?
      Elder Monk #4: We have known you were the Avatar for some time. Do you
      remember these?

      (The fourth monk on the right who has just spoken reveals a rolled up
      package, which he airbends over to Aang. It lands at his feet and rolls
      open of its own accord. Inside are four children&#x27;s toys. On the left is a
      little toy turtle. Second from the left is a propeller toy. Third from the
      left is a little monkey or donkey. The fourth is rattle type object with
      yellow and red swirls on its face.)

      Aang: Those were some of my favorite toys when I was little! (He picks up
      the propeller toy.)
      Elder Monk #4: You chose them from among thousands of toys, Aang. The toys
      you picked were the four Avatar relics. These items belonged to Avatars
      past. Your own past lives.
      Aang: I just chose them because they seemed fun.

      (He smiles and pulls the cord on the propeller toy, sending the propeller
      spinning into the air. It spins through the air and the scene cuts back to
      a close view of the five monks.)

      Elder Monk #4: You chose them because they were familiar.
      Monk Gyatso: Normally we would have told you of your identity when you
      turned 16, but there are troubling signs, storm clouds are gathering.
      Abbot: I fear that war may be upon us, young Avatar.
      Monk Gyatso: We need you, Aang.

      (Aang lowers his head, his responsibility crushing him. His head stays
      lowered, but the flashback ends. His head remains lowered in the present
      as well. Cut to a wider shot of Aang on the left, Katara on the right, the
      fire between them. Katara looks on him with concern and sympathy. Cut to
      Zuko&#x27;s ship navigating the storm, then cut to the Lieutenant from the
      earlier confrontation lowering a cup he has taken a drink from. He is
      inside the ship somewhere, his face bathed in firelight.)

      Lieutenant Jee: I&#x27;m sick of taking his orders and I&#x27;m tired of chasing his
      Avatar!

      (Cut to the Lieutenant sitting at a table and addressing a crewman on his
      left, making wide hand gestures to drive home his point.)

      Lieutenant Jee: I mean who does Zuko think he is?

      Iroh (from o.c.): Do you really want to know?

      (Cut to a view of the crewmen sitting around a fire barrel from a point at
      the top of the stairs from the upper deck. The Lieutenant and the three
      other crewman at the fire barrel stand in respect.)

      Lieutenant Jee: General Iroh! We were just �
      Iroh (entering from left, with a hand raised in acceptance): It&#x27;s ok. May
      I join you?
      Lieutenant Jee: Of course, sir!

      (Iroh approaches and sits down with the men. He strokes his beard and
      begins to speak.)

      Iroh: Try to understand, my nephew is a complicated young man. He has been
      through much�

      (Fade to a flashback of a younger Zuko, without his trademark scar. His
      look of determination, however, has not changed. He walks down a hall to a
      pair of Fire Nation guards who block his attempt to enter the room
beyond.)

      Zuko (in a higher voice than we are used to): Let me in! (Iroh appears
      from the left, putting his hands on the young man&#x27;s shoulders.)
      Iroh: Prince Zuko, what&#x27;s wrong?
      Zuko: I want to go into the war chamber, but the guard won&#x27;t let me pass!

      (Zuko&#x27;s voice breaks slightly at the end. He is clearly disappointed. Iroh
      leads him a short distance away from the guards.)

      Iroh: You&#x27;re not missing anything, trust me. These meetings are dreadfully
      boring.
      Zuko: If I&#x27;m gonna rule this nation one day, don&#x27;t you think I need to
      start learning as much as I can?
      Iroh: Very well. But you must promise not to speak. These old folks are a
      bit sensitive, you know.
      Zuko (bowing to Iroh): Thank you uncle!

      (Iroh puts him around Zuko&#x27;s shoulders and walks him past the guards, who
      make no move to stop them. Cut to a wide shot of the war chamber. It is a
      temple like chamber, with a throne on a dais, wreathed in fire. The back
      wall is occupied by some sort of huge, ornately carved red statue. The
      screen pans down to the show the war council in session. Fire Nation
      generals sit around a map of the Earth Kingdom continent that adorns the
      floor. One of the generals on the left is standing to address the general
      staff.)

      General: The Earth Kingdom defenses are concentrated here.

      (Cut to a view from the throne, where the Fire Lord is watching the
      generals discuss the situation, the cut back to the speaker.)

      General: A dangerous battalion of their strongest earthbenders and
      fiercest warriors, so I am recommending the 41st division.
      Old General: But the 41st is entirely new recruits. How do you expect them
      to defeat a powerful Earth Kingdom battalion?
      General (coldly): I don&#x27;t. They&#x27;ll be used as a distraction while we mount
      an attack from the rear. What better to use as bait then fresh meat?
      Zuko (jumping up): You can&#x27;t sacrifice an entire division like that! Those
      soldiers love and defend our nation! How can you betray them?

      (Cut to a view down the map as the generals look back to Zuko, clearly
      disapproving of Zuko&#x27;s outburst. The scene fades to the present where Iroh
      continue his story to the crewmen.)

      Iroh: Zuko was right, you see, but it was not his place to speak out, and
      there were�dire consequences.

      (Cut to overhead shot of Iroh and the crewmen around the table. Iroh
      lowers his head in sadness at the memory. The scenes fades, replaced by an
      overhead shot of Aang, Appa and Katara around the fire.)

      Katara: So you were upset that you were the Avatar? Why wouldn&#x27;t you be
      excited about it?
      Aang: Well, I didn&#x27;t know how to feel about it. All I knew is that after I
      found out, everything began changing�

      (Fade to another flashback at the plaza near the south wall of the
      Southern Air Temple. This time the plaza is full of young airbenders
      riding on air scooters, laughing, and having fun.)

      Aang: Hey, not bad! You guys have been practicing!
      Young Boy (scooting around Aang): Not only that, we made up a game you can
      play with the air scooters!
      Aang: Great!

      (Aang makes his own air scooter, but the young boy looks confused and a
      bit alarmed. He stops his scooter. The shot widens to show the other young
      airbenders stopping their scooters as well.)

      Aang (dismayed): What&#x27;s going on?
      Older Boy (unhappy, but without malice): Now that you&#x27;re the Avatar, it&#x27;s
      kind of an unfair advantage for whichever team you&#x27;re on.
      Aang (trying to smile): But I&#x27;m still the same � nothing&#x27;s changed. So,
      what, I can&#x27;t play?
      Older Boy: That&#x27;s the only fair way.
      Aang (dismounting his scooter): Oh, ok.
      Young Boy: Sorry, Aang.

      (The young airbenders look upon as he retreats from them, sadness in their
      eyes. The older boy turns to address them.)

      Older Boy: Okay, now who wants to have Jinju on their team?

      (Screen pans right to reveal a dirty looking airbender boy with a stupid
      grin on his face who makes an equally stupid noise. Cut to a view of Aang
      and Gyatso playing Pai Sho through an exterior window. Then a close up of
      Aang, who absentmidndely moves a token on the board. He is sad and
      distracted.)

      Monk Gyatso: Very interesting move, young one.
      Aang: What do you mean?

      (Behind his back, Monk Gyatso begins to bend air in an arch over his head
      and behind Aang. The wind blows Aang&#x27;s hood up over his face, giving the
      old monk time to switch a few pieces before Aang can remove the hood.)

      Aang (pointing at the board): Hey!

      (Both begin to laugh. The door opens to reveal one of the other monk
      elders, in fact the one who had been sitting fourth from the right in the
      prior scene.)

      Elder Monk #4: You&#x27;re playing games with him? The Avatar should be
      training.
      Monk Gyatso: Aang has already trained enough for today.
      Elder Monk #4: Time is short. Come with me. I must test you on some high
      level techniques.

      (Aang gets up and begins to follow the Elder out of the room. Monk Gyatso
      then raises his hand in a gesture of cessation.)

      Monk Gyatso: No, as long as I am his guardian, I will decide when he
      trains and when he gets his butt kicked at Pai Sho.
      Elder Monk #4 (close up, clearly angry): Huh!

      (The Elder Monk stalks off as Aang turns to smile at Monk Gyatso. The
      flashback ends as an overhead shot of the cave scene returns. This scene
      then fades to be replaced by Iroh&#x27;s face.)

      Iroh: After Zuko&#x27;s outburst in the meeting, the Fire Lord became very
      angry with him. He said that Prince Zuko&#x27;s challenge of the general was an
      act of complete disrespect, and there was only one way to resolve this�
      Lieutenant Jee (horrified): Agni kai. A fire duel.
      Iroh: That&#x27;s right. Zuko looked upon the old general he had insulted and
      declared that he was not afraid. But Zuko misunderstood. When he turned to
      face his opponent, he was surprised to see it was not the General. Zuko
      had spoken out against a general&#x27;s plan, but by doing so in the Fire
      Lord&#x27;s war room, it was the Fire Lord whom he had disrespected. Zuko would
      have to duel his own father.

      (In the midst of Iroh&#x27;s story we see Zuko in a rectangular arena with a
      large crowd on either side. He drops his ceremonial cloak to the floor,
      exposing his bare chest. He turns to face his opponent, and, recognizing
      him, freezes in horror. The scene then cuts to the cave with Aang and
      Katara.)

      Aang: Then, just when I was starting to feel better, something worse
      happened.

      (Aang&#x27;s flashback resumes, this time of Monk Gyatso and Elder Monk #4
      standing in front of the monk who sits on the middle stool under the
      parasol, presumably the abbot.)

      Monk Gyatso: Aang needs to have freedom and fun. He needs to grow up as a
      normal boy.
      Elder Monk #4: Humph! You cannot keep protecting him from his destiny.
      Abbot: Gyatso, I know you mean well, but you are letting your affection
      for the boy cloud your judgment.
      Monk Gyatso: All I want is what is best for him.
      Abbot: But what we need is what&#x27;s best for the world. (Looking down for a
      moment before raising his head to continue) You and Aang must be
      separated. The Avatar will be sent away to the Eastern Air Temple to
      complete his training.

      (Monk Gyatso bows as the camera zooms past him to reveal Aang
      eavesdropping through a hole in the ceiling, his eyes alarmed and
      distraught. Cut to commercial break.)

      Scene III

      (Show returns to a shot from inside the cave looking out. It is still
      pouring. The camera pans left back to Appa, Katara and Aang around the
      fire.)

      Katara: That&#x27;s awful, Aang. I don&#x27;t know what to say.

      (Katara tries to put her hand on his shoulder, but he gets up, angry.)

      Aang: How could they do that to me! They wanted to take away everything I
      knew and everyone I loved!

      (Aang&#x27;s avatar spirit begins to activate, the arrow tattoos on his body
      beginning to glow and the energy shell seen in �The Southern Air Temple�
      beginning to form around him. He shuts it down however as Katara cries out
      as cinders from the fire swirl around her.)

      Katara: Whoa! Hot cinders!
      Aang (his glow fading): I&#x27;m sorry I got so mad.
      Katara: You have a right to be angry after the monks sent you away like
      that.
      Aang: Well, that&#x27;s not exactly what happened�

      (Aang&#x27;s looks downcast and guilty as the camera zooms past his left
      shoulder. The flashback then continues, showing an overhead shot of the
      young airbender monks hard at play on their air scooters back at the south
      wall. The shot zooms backwards to reveal that we are seeing the kids from
      Aang&#x27;s p.o.v. � he is watching them from a window high up in the Temple.
      He is sad and clearly longs to be normal again. While Aang narrates to
      Katara, the Aang in the flashback leaves his window and flops dejectedly
      on his bed.)

      Aang (from o.c., narrating from the present): I was afraid and confused. I
      didn&#x27;t know what to do.

      (The scene fades to a night scene in the hallway outside of Aang&#x27;s
      bedroom. Monk Gyatso approaches, knocks and enters.)

      Monk Gyatso: Aang, I&#x27;m not going to let them take you away from me. Aang?

      (Gyatso sees a rolled up scroll on Aang&#x27;s bed. He picks it up and opens
      it, his eyes going wide in concern. He draws an intake of breath to look
      at the window where it is storming violently. The camera pans across the
      storm tossed ocean as Aang narrates again from the present.)

      Aang: I never saw Gyatso again.

      (The flashback continues with Aang&#x27;s and Appa&#x27;s plunge into the sea during
      the storm, activation of Aang&#x27;s avatar spirit and subsequent encasement in
      ice.)

      Aang: Next thing I knew, I was waking up in your arms after you found me
      in the iceberg.

      (The flashback ends. Aang looks vacantly across the fire, a slightly
      guilty expression still settled on his face.)

      Katara: You ran away.
      Aang (looking up at Katara): And then the Fire Nation attacked our temple.
      My people needed me and I wasn&#x27;t there to help.
      Katara: You don&#x27;t know what would&#x27;ve �
      Aang: The world needed me and I wasn&#x27;t there to help.
      Katara: Aang�
      Aang: The fisherman was right! I did turn my back on the world.
      Katara: You&#x27;re being too hard on yourself. Even if you did run away, I
      think it was meant to be. If you had stayed you would have been killed
      along with all the other airbenders.
      Aang: You don&#x27;t know that.
      Katara: I know it&#x27;s meant to be this way. The world needs you now. You
      give people hope.

      (Aang slowly smiles, raising his head to look at her, an expression of
      hope spreading across his face. Momo hops over to Aang and chitters. Fade
      back to the fire lit chamber on Zuko&#x27;s ship, where Iroh continues his
      story.)

      Iroh: When Prince Zuko saw that it was his father who had come to duel
      him, he begged for mercy�

      (While Iroh speaks, the scene cuts to view of Iroh&#x27;s face through the fire
      that burns in the fire barrel around which the crewman sit. When his voice
      trails off, the flashback continues where we left off, with an overhead
      shot of Zuko in the rectangular arena. A much larger opponent,
      silhouetted, advances slowly on Zuko. Cut to a side view of the horrified
      Zuko.)

      Zuko: Please, father, I only had the fire nation&#x27;s best interest at heart!
      I&#x27;m sorry I spoke out of turn!

      (Cut to a closer shot of the advancing Fire Lord, still silhouetted
      against the fires burning around the arena. He too is shirtless, but built
      massively.)

      Fire Lord Ozai: You will fight for your honor.
      Zuko (stricken, abasing himself on the floor): I meant you no disrespect.
      I am your loyal son.
      Fire Lord Ozai: Rise and fight, Prince Zuko!
      Zuko: I won&#x27;t fight you.
      Fire Lord Ozai: You will learn respect, and suffering will be your
teacher.

      (The Fire Lord now stands a few feet from Zuko, as the Prince raises his
      tear filled face to his father. Cut to a close up of some spectators. They
      are familiar. Many in the background are generals from the war council.
      The three in the foreground are, from left, a grinning Admiral Zhao (then
      either Captain or Commander), General Iroh, looking fearful for his
      nephew, and a cruel looking young girl in a soldier&#x27;s uniform who is
      clearly hoping for the worst to befall Prince Zuko. This is Azula, Zuko&#x27;s
      sister, as the audience learns at the end of the season finale for Book
      One. She raises her left fist in anticipation of the disgrace her brother
      is undergoing. Iroh&#x27;s looks away in despair.)

      Iroh: I looked away.

      (The spectators are illuminated by flame, Zuko&#x27;s scream of anguish is
      heard in the background, and the camera zooms to a close up of Iroh. The
      flashback ends, but Iroh&#x27;s face in the present is in the same pose as it
      was when Zuko was scarred. It is clearly an unpleasant memory.)

      Lieutenant Jee (abashed): I always thought that Prince Zuko was in a
      training accident�
      Iroh: It was no accident. After the duel, the Fire Lord said that by
      refusing to fight, Zuko had shown shameful weakness. As punishment he was
      banished and sent to capture the Avatar. Only then could he return with
      his honor.
      Lieutenant Jee: So that&#x27;s why he&#x27;s so obsessed. Capturing the Avatar is
      the only chance he has of things returning to normal.
      Iroh: Things will never return to normal. But the important thing is, the
      Avatar gives Zuko hope.

      (Cut to a shot of Zuko&#x27;s back. He is in darkness, except the flame on the
      altar in front of him. The flame is blocked by his body so he is
      silhouetted. A flashback appears in a still frame. It of two young
      children running across the crest of a hillside, an older man, their
      father, follows behind. The colors are drab, but the children look happy.
      The scene cuts quickly back to Zuko in front of the altar, and then to
      another flashback. This one is a close of a young boy, Zuko, perhaps at
      Aang&#x27;s age, standing on that same hillcrest with his father next to him.
      His father&#x27;s hand is on his shoulder. Cut back to Zuko at the altar again,
      and then back to the previous flashback, except this time from the front,
      showing a much younger Zuko, clearly smiling and happy. The music becomes
      serious though, as the flashback fades around the boy&#x27;s face, replaced by
      the face of Zuko from the present, scarred and unhappy. Zuko turns as a
      lightning strike is hears, cut to a shot of the ship in the storm,
      lightening striking the bridge. Cut to the cave where Aang and Katar turn
      to look at someone entering the cave, the storm still raging outside.)

      Old Woman: Help! Oh, please help!
      Katara (rushing to her side): It&#x27;s ok, you&#x27;re safe.

      (Both walk back to the fire deeper in the cave.)

      Old Woman: But, my husband isn&#x27;t.
      Katara: What do you mean? Where&#x27;s Sokka?
      Old Woman: They haven&#x27;t returned. They should&#x27;ve been back by now, and
      this storm is becoming a typhoon. They&#x27;re caught out at sea.
      Aang (standing, resolute): I&#x27;m going to find them.
      Katara: I&#x27;m going with you.
      Old Woman: I&#x27;m staying here!

      (Cut to exterior shot of cave, where the weather is horrible. Appa&#x27;s nose
      is sticking out of the cave; he is ready to take off. Cut to Aang and
      Katara getting on to Appa. Aang turns to the old woman.)

      Aang (to the old woman): We&#x27;ll be back soon, I promise.

      (Cut to Appa flying away from the cave, and then a quick cut to Zuko&#x27;s
      ship battling the waves. Cut again to Zuko and the Lieutenant struggling
      to stay upright on the ship&#x27;s main deck. Water drenches them and the deck
      repeatedly.)

      Zuko: Where were we hit?
      Lieutenant Jee: I don&#x27;t know!
      Iroh: Look!

      (Iroh points up to the bridge tower. A crewman hangs off some of the
      rigging.)

      Zuko: The helmsman!

      (Cut to Zuko climbing the external ladder up to the bridge area, the
      Lieutenant behind him. Cut to the deck, where Iroh senses something. A
      lighting strike flares, but Iroh bends the lightning through his body,
      away from the men trying to rescue the helmsman and forces it to strike
      open water. Cut back to Iroh, smoking and looking confused, but otherwise
      undamaged. Cut back to the helmsman who finally lets go with a cry. He
      falls for a moment, but a hand grabs him. Zuko and the Lieutenant have
      worked together to save him. Cut to Katara and Aang flying on Appa in the
      storm.)

      Katara: Where are they?
      Aang: Come on, Appa!

      (Aang sees a massive wall of water up ahead. It towers above them. Appa
      can&#x27;t pull up in time, but they bust through its crest with a combination
      of Appa&#x27;s strength and Aang using his staff like a helicopter blade to
      part the water. In the distance they see a small boat, silhouetted by
      lighting strikes.)

      Aang (pointing to the horizon): The boat! It&#x27;s there!

      (Cut to a longshot of Appa flying in the clouds, then a quick cut to Zuko,
      Iroh and the Lieutenant, who can clearly see Appa in turn.)

      Zuko: The Avatar!
      Lieutenant Jee: What do you want to do, sir?
      Zuko (pausing to consider): Let him go. We need to get this ship to
safety.
      Iroh: Then we must head directly into the eye of the storm.

      (Iroh smiles slightly as the screen pans left to show Zuko and the crew
      looking out over the bow. Then cut to Sokka and the old man struggling to
      pilot the fishing boat.)

      Sokka: I&#x27;m too young to die!
      Old Man: I&#x27;m not, but I still don&#x27;t wanna!

      (Cut to a longshot of the fishing boat struggling against the waves. Appa
      flies in close and Aang jumps onto the boat. Lighting strikes the main
      mast which breaks off. It is about to hit Aang, but he splits it in two,
      the halves falling harmlessly on either side of him. Sokka has a rope in
      his hands, which Aang grabs.)

      Aang: Hang on to the rope!

      (Aang airbends himself back onto Appa, pulling Sokka and the old man with
      him. Both land on Appa as well, the old man spitting out some water and
      smile sheepishly. Behind them a shadow appears and the sound of rushing
      water is heard. The view widens to show a wave building behind them much
      larger than even the one shown before. Appa tries to escape, but the wave
      is too fast. They are submerged. In a sequence that is eerily similar to
      the scene where he freezed himself, Aang drifts away from Appa and his
      friends in the water. His avatar spirit activates, but in a departure from
      the previous encounter, instead of creating an iceberg, he surrounds
      himself and his friends with a ball of energy and raises them back up out
      of the water and into the sky. Cut to Zuko and the crew on the deck of the
      ship. They have reached the eye of the storm, which they can see above
      them. The wind has died down and it is drizzling.)

      Zuko: Uncle, I am sorry.
      Iroh (smiling, putting a hand on his nephew&#x27;s shoulder): Your apology is
      accepted.

      (The Avatar&#x27;s bubble of energy erupts from the sea in boiling blue mass in
      front of the prow of Zuko&#x27;s ship and rockets into the air. Cut to Aang
      looking back at the ship, and cut to Zuko looking up from the deck and the
      camera angle widens, indicating that we are seeing the receding Zuko from
      Aang&#x27;s viewpoint. Cut the reverse, as Appa recedes up into the eye. Cut to
      Appa now standing out in the drizzle on the parapet outside the cave where
      Aang had told Katara his story. Cut to Aang and the old man at the cave
      entrance, the old woman running to embrace her husband.)

      Old Woman: Oh, you&#x27;re alive! (Voice turning sour and pointing to Aang) You
      owe this boy an apology.
      Aang: He doesn&#x27;t have to apologize.
      Old Man: Mmm, uh, what if instead of an apology I give him a free fish and
      we call it even?
      Aang: Actually, I don&#x27;t eat meat.
      Old Man: Fish ain&#x27;t meat.
      Sokka (holding out his hand): Seriously, you&#x27;re still gonna pay me, right?

      (The old man drops a fish into his outstretched hand with a wet smacking
      sound. Sokka makes a frightened sound. Cut to Aang and Katara.)

      Aang: Katara, I think you were right before. I&#x27;m done dwelling on the
      past.
      Katara: Really?
      Aang: I can&#x27;t make guesses about how things would have turned out if I
      hadn&#x27;t run away. I&#x27;m here now and I&#x27;m going to make the most of it.
      Katara (smiling): I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re gonna have those nightmares
anymore.
      Old Man (entering from left and putting his hand on Aang&#x27;s shoulder): Uh,
      if you weren&#x27;t here now, well, I guess I wouldn&#x27;t be either. Thank you for
      saving my life, Avatar.

      (Cut to Sokka looking out of the cave entrance.)

      Sokka: Do you hear that? It&#x27;s stopped raining.

      (Cut to longshot of outside, where the sun is starting to break through.
      The shot widens to show the parapet where Appa and the rest are now
      standing. Appa shakes himself off, drenching everyone.)

      Everyone: Appa!

你都梦见啥了？
食物会吃人
还有，模模还会说话了。
你跟我说话 老不客气了
要下暴风雨了，来势不小啊
你糊涂了吧，皇叔。
今天烈日当空，万里无云的
这场风暴从北方逼近
我建议更改航线，向西南行驶。
降世神通向北行，我们也必须如此
祖寇殿下，你要考虑一下船员的安危
船员的安危无关紧要！
找到降世神通比任何人的安危都来得重要
请别误会，他只是一时头脑发热
（王婆登场）
哎呀，你听我得没错，这瓜太好了，都没治了
总觉得里面稀里光趟的
稀里光趟的才好呢，说明瓜熟了，明白不？
没错的，卡塔拉，稀里光趟的就熟了
刚看到我们没带够钱，抱歉了
吃的没了，现在钱又花光了，现在该咋办啊？
打个工呗，聪明人
我们不该出海！求你了，鱼哪天不能打啊
今天将有大风暴
别说胡话！这么好的天，没云、没风、没闪电的
别跟我唠叨了
也许咱们该找个地方避一避
开什么玩乐，避啥啊？
今天我的关节老疼了，肯定有大风暴要来

双倍工钱？你听谁胡诌的？
呃！看来真让你的皇叔说着了
侥幸猜中而已
上尉，你要是不懂得尊敬我的话，我可以教你。
说到尊重，你又了解多少
看看你对周围人说话的态度，
你对你的皇叔、辛勤工作的船员
表现出一点尊重来了吗？
你根本就不知道什么叫尊重
你只在乎自己的感受
一个被宠坏的王子还想得到什么尊重？
你们都冷静点
够了！可能是出海太久了，大家都累了
大家一块吃碗面条，心情一会就会好起来的
我不需要你来维护这儿的秩序，这船是我的
索卡，你还是别出海了，看，这都变天了
我说过了这活我干定了，
因为天气不好就不干了算怎么回事啊
那个有纹身的孩子好像有些灵性，你应该听他的

你是降世神通？那我还是肥猪猴的叔叔呢？
他就是降世神通
降世神通有什么好，年前销声匿迹
置整个世界于不顾
别冲他嚷，安昂 不会背弃任何人的
哦，是吗？真的？
那这百年来所受的战争和痛苦都是想象出来的？
安昂是我见过的最勇敢的人
和他相处至今，他一直都在帮助人们，拯救生命
当初消失并不是他的错，我说得没错吧，安昂
安昂，怎么了？
没错，没错，只管飞你的好了
你这个老头真可恶
阿柏，驾，驾
嘿，他们居然没说一声就走了
你的朋友真不懂得礼貌
那可不是嘛，你知道曾经吧...
行了，知道了，知道了，把这些搬下去
抱歉我跑开了
没关系，那个渔夫是有点过分
其实他说错
这话怎么说？
我现在不想谈这个
这跟你这几天做的噩梦有关吧
跟我说说吧
好吧，说来话长啊
我先生上火，咱们慢慢聊
长老们告诉我我就是降世神通那天，我终生难忘
当时，我和其他的小孩在南墙外玩耍，
我正在叫他们如何玩“气轮球”
首先，你们做个气球，然后快速骑上
-好的，让我试试
-快，骑上
这个气轮球就像个陀螺一样，
你得学会在上面保持平衡
天哪，真是太难了
安昂，你是在哪学会这招的？
我自己想出来
安昂，过来，我们有话要跟你说
你们怎么知道会是我？
我们早就知道你是降世神通了
还记得这些东西吗？
这些是我小时候最喜爱的玩具
安昂，你从上千个玩具中单单选中了这几样
你挑选的这几样玩具都是神通的圣物
这些是神通前世，也就你的前世所拥有的物件
我选它们，只是因为它们看上去很好玩
你选它们是因为你熟悉它们
一般来说我们会在你岁后告诉你的身份
但是现在有异象发生，暴风云正在聚集
恐怕战争已经逼近这儿了，神通
我们需要你，安昂
我听够了他的命令，
再也不想追踪他的什么降世神通了
祖寇认为他自己是谁啊？
你真地想知道吗？
艾洛将军，我们只是...
没关系，我能加入你们吗？
当然可以，长官
你们得了解，
我侄子是一个难懂的年轻人，
他遭受的经历太多了
让我进去
祖寇殿下，怎么了？
我想进军情室，但是警卫不让我进去
相信我，你并没有错过什么
这些会议相当无聊了
终有一天我将统治这个国家，
你不觉得我应该从现在开始多写一些东西吗？
说得没错，但是你得答应我不要随便讲话
这些老家伙们有些敏感
多谢您皇叔
土强国的抵抗力量集中在这里
必将会遭遇到土强国最厉害的御土师
和最骁勇的战士
所以我建议将第师派往这里
但是师全都是由新兵组成的
他们怎么可能战败这么强大的土强国军团
他们是不行，只是用他们吸引敌军的注意力，
我们将从敌军的后防进攻
作诱饵，当然得用新鲜的肉了
你不能就这样牺牲掉整个师
这些战士热爱并守护着我们的国家，
你怎么能背叛他们？
祖寇说得没错，可是场合不对，
从而招致了悲惨的结果
你因为你是将世神通而感到难过？
你应该感到激动才对啊？
其实，我不知道该怎么想
我只知道，在我得知这个消息之后，一切都改变了
嘿，不错嘛，你们都在练习
我们不光练习了，还想出了一个用气轮球玩的游戏呢
太棒了
怎么了？
现在你是降世神通了，把你分到哪组，
对其他组来说都是不公平的
但是，我还是我啊，我并没有变
这么说，我不能玩吗？
只有这样对大家才公平啊
哦，好吧
抱歉了，安昂
好吧，哪组要 “金猪”（音译）？
年轻人，这步棋下的很有意思啊
为啥这么说？
你竟然在这儿和他玩上了？神通现在应该进行训练
安昂今天的训练已经结束了
时间紧迫，跟我来，
我得考核一下你对高级招数的掌握
不行，只要我是他的监护人一天，
他的训练都由我来安排，
现在他要和我一起下棋
由于祖寇在那次会议上的莽撞行为，烈火王震怒
他认为祖寇挑战将军完全是一种不敬的行为
而对于这种行为只有一种了结的方法
火神祭——火功对决
（Agni Kai, Agni是一个火神，Kai在日语中有集会的意思）
没错
祖寇没把得罪的老将军放在眼里，毫无畏惧的应战了
但是他错了，在火神祭上他才发现
他的对手并不是那个将军
由于祖寇是在烈火王军情室中
出言顶撞的将军
那就是对烈火王的不敬
所以祖寇需要和他的父亲对决
当我刚刚感觉好点的时候，更糟的事发生了
安昂也需要自由和快乐
他理应象正常的孩子一样成长
哼！不管你怎样保护他，他终究要面对自己的命运
雅俗，我知道你是好心
但是你对这孩子的关爱蒙蔽了你的判断力
我只是想一心为他好
可是我们需要为天下人着想
你和安昂必须分开
我们将送安昂去东气和寺完成他的修炼
那可真糟糕啊，安昂，我不知该说些什么
他们怎么能这样对我
他们竟然要把我所了解的东西、我所爱的人都带走
啊！安昂，冷静点
对不起，我有点失态了
长老们就这样把你送走使不对的，你有理由生气
其实，事情还没有发展到那步
当时我既害怕又困惑
我不知道该怎么做
安昂，我不会让他们把你从我这儿带走的
安昂？
从此，我再也没有见过雅俗大师
之后我只记得你在冰川中发现了我，我在你的臂弯中醒来
你出走了
我出走后火宗的人袭击了我们寺
我的人民们需要我，我却没能帮上忙
你也不知道会...
世界需要我的时候，我也没能能挺身而出
安昂
那个渔夫说得对，我背叛了天下人
你对自己过于苛求了
我想你当初的出走也是天意吧
如果你当初留下来，可能像其他的气宗人一样被杀了
你怎么知道会是那样
我知道这是天意
天下人现在需要你
你给人们带来了希望
当祖寇殿下得知对决的对手是他的父王时
他跪地求饶
父王，求您了，我是一心效忠烈火国的
是我一时失言，孩儿知错了
来吧，为你的尊严而战
我不是存心对您不敬
我可是您的皇子啊
祖寇，起来迎战
我不会很您动手的
你会学会尊敬的，痛苦会是你最好的老师
我实在是不忍看下去了
我一直以为祖寇殿下是在训练中意外弄伤的
并没有什么意外
决斗之后，由于祖寇拒绝动手过招
烈火王认为祖寇相当的懦弱
于是放逐了他，并派他去追捕降世神通
只有抓到神通，找回他的尊严才能回去
所以他才如此专注
抓住神通是他重返正常生活的唯一途径
然而他的人生再也不会恢复正常了
不过重要的事，神通的出现给祖寇带来了希望
救命啊，救命啊
没事了，你现在安全了
但是，我的老伴还没安全
您此言怎讲？索卡还没回来吗？
他们现在都还没回来，应该回不来了
风暴马上就要演变成台风了
他们一定被困在海上了
我去找他们
我也跟你一起去
我可哪儿也不去了
我保证，我们会很快回来的
咱们哪儿被打中了？
我也不知道
看哪
舵手
他们在哪啊？
加油啊，阿柏
看哪，船在那儿呢
降世神通出现了
长官，听从你的调遣
随他去吧，咱们得保住这艘船
那咱们得直接向着暴风眼处行驶
我还年轻，我不想死啊
我不年轻了，可是我还没活够啊
抓住绳子
皇叔，我很抱歉
没关系
太好了，你还活着
你应该向这孩子道歉
他用不着道歉
嗯，这个...给他点鱼不要钱，
就当是我道歉了吧，咱们可扯平了
实际上，我不吃肉
鱼肉可不算肉
说真的，你还没付我工钱呢
卡塔拉，我想你之前说得对，计较过去是徒劳的
你真的这么想吗？
如果我之前没有出走的话，
我完全无法想象事情该如何发展
既然我回来了，我就应该担起责任
我想你再也不会做那些噩梦了
嗯，如果你不在这儿的话，我想我可能就死在风暴里了
神通，多谢你的救命之恩
你们听到了吗？
雨停下来了
阿柏！

水善国
土强国
火烈国
气和国
很久以前，这四大国和谐共处
然而，烈火国发起的战争结束了和平
只有同时掌握四种元素的降世神通才能结束战争
然而在大家最需要他的时候，他却消失了
年后，我和哥哥发现了转世的降世神通，
他是个御气师，名叫“安昂”
尽管他的御气术着实厉害
在拯救苍生之前，他要学的还有很多
但是我坚信
安昂 能拯救这个世界
