Act I

(Opening shot of four massive fireballs arcing over the Water City walls
and into the city. It is daylight and the battle for the survival of the
Northern Water Tribe has begun in earnest. Cut to an overhead shot from
behind the citadel. The four fireballs land at various points within the
city and explode. The camera pans back to the sanctuary, where Appa and
the others are. Cut to a close up shot of the black and white fish
circling each other in the sanctuary pond. Katara begins to speak from
o.c. at first, then cut to wide shot of her, Yue, Sokka, Momo and Appa.
Katara is kneeling at the pool.)

Katara: I can&#x27;t believe I lost him.
Sokka: You did everything you could and now we need to do everything we
can to get him back.

(Sokka leads Yue over to Appa. Cut to a shot of Katara&#x27;s back. She turns
to look at her brother o.c., tears brimming over her eyes.)

Sokka (continuing from o.c.) : Zuko can&#x27;t have gotten far. We&#x27;ll find him.
Aang&#x27;s gonna be fine.
Katara (getting up): Okay.

(She walks by Momo, who looks out over the pond. He chitters softly and
sadly. Cut to Katara now standing atop Appa, Sokka at the reigns, Yue
beside her.)

Katara: It&#x27;s all right. You stay here, Momo, in case Aang comes back.
Sokka: Yip! Yip!

(Appa launches himself into the air and out of the sanctuary into the
frozen, snowing wasteland above. Cut to Appa flying over the ice dunes,
the snowing coming down hard from the dark, gray sky.

Shift to a long trail in the snow that goes to the horizon, then cut to a
shot of Zuko&#x27;s feet tramping through the drifting snow, Aang&#x27;s feet
dragging behind him. After a few shots of Zuko dragging him through the
blizzard, the shot cuts to a close up of Aang&#x27;s face. His eyes are closed,
but his tattoo arrow on his head glows white. The screen flashes white for
an instant.

When the picture returns, it is of a split second close up of Aang&#x27;s face.
The camera almost instantly zooms backward to show sitting cross legged on
a platform in the middle of a bamboo swamp. He is in a meditative pose as
his eyes open. Cut to a long shot of Aang sitting on the platform amidst
the swamp. A white bird flies by in an instant. Aang gets up and runs off
the platform Cut to a shot of Aang&#x27;s upper body as he looks around the
swamp. Behind him is a small island. A temple like structure, like the one
behind the pond in the Water Tribe sanctuary, but thicker and cruder,
rests on top of the small island. Underneath the cross bar of the
structure a figure sits cross-legged.)

Mystical Monkey: Ohmm�Ohmmmm�.

(Aang hears the chanting and runs up the island to the see a white haired
monkey sitting in meditative repose. He wears a brown monk&#x27;s shawl.)

Aang: Hello? I&#x27;m sorry to disturb you, but I just really need to find the
Moon and the Ocean spirits.
Mystical Monkey (without opening his eyes): Go�away.

(He pauses for a moment, then opens one eye at Aang.)

Mystical Monkey: You&#x27;re still here?
Aang: Yes! I need �
Mystical Monkey (shutting his eyes tightly): Ohmm!! Ohmmm!

(A blue will-o&#x27;-the-wisp enters from the right, emitting a slight
crystalline noise.)

Mystical Monkey: Perhaps that thing will help you? Chase it!

(Aang runs after it. The mystical monkey keeps his eyes shut for a second
more, then opens one to confirm Aang&#x27;s departure. He shakes his head.)

Mystical Monkey (sighing): Finally!

(Cut to Aang chasing the will-o&#x27;-the-wisp through the swamp. He chases it
up a tree and out onto a large branch. He catches it, a huge smile on his
face. As he does, the tree branch liquefies underneath him and he falls,
screaming, to the water below and lands with a splash. As he lies in the
water the will-o&#x27;-the-wisp gets away from him.)

Aang (getting up): Come back!

(He moves to follow the will-o&#x27;-the-wisp, but stops to look at the water.
As the ripples from the splash dissipate an image forms where his own
reflection should be. It is Avatar Roku.)

Avatar Roku: Hello, Aang.
Aang: Roku!

(The screen flashes white and returns with a shot of Zuko carrying Aang
through the snow. After some steps, the ice underneath Zuko begins to
crack and cave in. Within a few seconds most of the ground around him is
collapsing. He begins to run with Aang on his back. He manages to keep
just ahead of the yawning hole that his footsteps over thin ice have
caused to appear. The hole finally stops expanding as Zuko trips and
falls. They are now on the lip of a newly formed canyon. He looks ahead to
see a rock ledge overhanging a small cave.)

Zuko: Shelter!

(Cut to a shot from inside the cave. Zuko appears, dragging Aang inside by
the collar. Outside the blizzard continues. He dumps him at the back of
the cave and ties his hands behind his back with some of the rope he is
carrying. Cut to a zoom in close up shot of Aang, his tattoo aglow. The
screen flashes white and when it returns we once again see Aang looking
down at the reflection in the water of the Spirit World swamp.)

Aang: Roku, the Water Tribe is under attack. I need to find the Ocean and
Moon spirits!

(Cut to a profile shot of Aang looking at the water. Suddenly, maroon
colored water fountains up and solidifies into the shape of Avatar Roku.)

Avatar Roku: The Ocean and the Moon are ancient spirits. They crossed over
from the Spirit World to the Mortal World very near the beginning. There
is only one spirit I know of who is old enough to remember.
Aang: Who?
Avatar Roku: The spirit&#x27;s name is Koh. But he is very dangerous. They call
him�the Face Stealer.

(Cut to close up of Aang looking shocked and frightened. Then cut back to
an overhead shot of the two.)

Avatar Roku: When you speak with him you must be very careful to show no
emotion at all � not the slightest expression or he will steal your face!

(Aang forces the fear from his face and nods to Roku stoically.

The screen flashes white and we return to the frozen wastes where the
blizzard rages. Appa&#x27;s forepaw enters the picture and slams deep into the
snow. He rumbles. Cut to Sokka looking out over the canyon created by Zuko
and Aang&#x27;s passage. He turns around to look at Katara, her eyes wide with
concern and fear. She lowers her face, fearing the worst.

A long shot of Appa and the others is quickly replaced by one of Zuko
blowing fire into his hands to keep warm. He looks over at Aang.)

Zuko: I finally have you. But I can&#x27;t get you home because of this
blizzard. (He walks over to the cave entrance to look out at the falling
snow, his back to the camera) There&#x27;s always something. Not that you would
understand. You&#x27;re like my sister. Everything always�came easy to her.
She&#x27;s a firebending prodigy � and everyone adores her. (Cut to a frontal
view of Zuko) My father says she was born lucky. He says I was lucky to be
born. (Cut to view of his back again.) I don&#x27;t need luck though, I don&#x27;t
want it. I&#x27;ve always had to struggle and fight and that&#x27;s made me strong.
It&#x27;s made me who I am.

(Cut to a shot of Fire Nation assault on the city below. A line of Fire
Navy ships abuts the outer wall, which continue launching fireballs deep
into the unoccupied portions of the city. The shot pans left to reveal
that the invaders have penetrated the outer wall with infantry and armor.
The Water Tribe still holds one of the towers in the foreground, but it is
clear the defenders are losing this battle.

Cut to a close up shot of a couple Fire Nation war rhinoceros, each with
small catapults on either side of its saddle. One after the other the
soldiers on the rhinoceros fire their catapults.

The scene shifts again to a wide shot covering the middle half of the city
where the secondary wall still holds, a thin moat of water in front of it.
The defenders are few, however, and a deadly rain of fireballs enters the
frame, spreading destruction deep inside the city. Cut to a close up of
rank upon rank of Fire Nation tanks, firing as they advance toward the
secondary wall.

The defenders rally atop the secondary wall, where a line of waterbenders
returns fire. Right under the top of the wall is a line of portholes
through which water pours into the moat below. The waterbenders motion in
unison and the gentle streams become mighty jets of water. Two tanks are
washed away, but several others behind them fire massive grappling hooks
into the secondary wall. The hooks penetrate the wall clear through to the
other side as the waterbenders scatter. The tanks with the grappling hooks
then begin to reel back on the lines. The tanks are anchored in the ice to
prevent the tank from just hauling itself to the wall. The wall cracks
slowly, then gives way as more fireballs fly overhead. A huge breach has
been opened, revealing a war rhinoceros and other infantry ready to pour
through.

Cut to a wide shot from the p.o.v. of the outer wall. Three more tanks on
the left pull down large sections of the secondary wall. The space in
between the primary and secondary walls is brimming with Fire Nation
soldiers, tanks and rhinoceros. Numerous fireballs have landed in the
residential section beyond and parts of the city are on fire.

The scene shifts to show the ornate prow of Zhao&#x27;s flagship and the other
surrounding vessels.)

Iroh (voice over): I don&#x27;t need to remind you we have a time limit. (Cut
to Iroh standing next to Zhao on the bridge&#x27;s observation deck) If we
don&#x27;t defeat the Water Tribe before the full moon rises they will be
undefeatable.
Zhao (smiling evilly): I assure you I have everything under control. I
intend to remove the moon as a factor.
Iroh (incredulously): Remove the moon!? How?
Hahn (entering from behind, spear in hand): Admiral Choi! (He takes off
his helmet and throws it aside.) Prepare to meet your fate!

(He rushes forward to Zhao, who casually throws him overboard. Hahn
screams as he falls o.c. and then a loud splash is heard. Iroh looks down
and shakes his head, then turns back to Zhao.)

Zhao (ignoring the pathetic assassination attempt): As I was saying�years
ago I stumbled upon a great and powerful secret�the identity of the Moon
Spirit&#x27;s mortal form.
Iroh (shocked): What?

(Cut to a close up of Zhao&#x27;s face in profile. His eyes are closed, a cruel
smile on his lips. The screen pans right and fades to the show the memory
Zhao begins to describe.)

Zhao: I was a young Lieutenant serving under General Shu in the Earth
Kingdom�

(Fade to a long shot of Zhao sitting at a desk in a windowless room,
perhaps a basement of some sort as stairs lead up in the foreground. In
front of Zhao, the candle on the desk illuminates a map of the middle
Earth Kingdom on the wall in front of the desk.)

Zhao: I discovered a hidden library, underground in fact. I tore through
scroll after scroll. One of them contained a detailed illustration and the
words �moon� and �ocean.� I knew then that these spirits could be found �
and killed. (The memory ends with a close up of Zhao&#x27;s eyes, then fade to
the present.) And that it was my destiny to do so.
Iroh (angry): Zhao, the Spirits are not to be trifled with!
Zhao (patronizingly): Yes, yes, I know you fear the Spirits, Iroh. I&#x27;ve
heard rumors about your journey into the Spirit World. But the Ocean and
Moon gave up their immortality to become a part of our world � (cut to a
shot behind the two, showing the assault on the city) and now they will
face the consequences!

(The screen flashes white again, transitioning back to the Spirit World.
Here was see a long shot of Aang hopping across the top of a line of
wooden pylons on his way to a huge gnarled tree in the background. The
tree is partially silhouetted by a light source behind it that is too dim
to be the sun, but too bright to be the moon. Aang stops as a monstrous
coyote or other dog like creature passes behind the tree � it must be the
size of small mountain. Aang continues his approach to the base of the
tree. There is a dark hole at the base of the tree. Aang approaches the
hole fearfully. Cut to Aang&#x27;s p.o.v. as the camera zooms in on the hole,
but it stops short as the a monkey&#x27;s screech is heard. The camera pans
left to show a monkey sitting on the root of the tree, looking away from
the camera.)

Aang (with relief): Oh! Whew! You&#x27;re just a curly tailed blue nose.

(Cut back to the monkey, who turns around to reveal that it has no face.
Aang starts in fright, then drops all emotion from his face. He breathes
deeply.)

Aang (in unison with voice over from Roku): Show no fear. Show no emotion
at all.

(Aang walks into the hole, then cut to commercial break.)

Act II

(The show returns to shot of the Koh&#x27;s tree silhouetted against the unseen
backlight. As the shot pans down the scene fades to show Aang descending
the staircase into Koh&#x27;s lair. The lair opening is still seen above, light
pouring in through it. The lair is dark, though not the pitch black scene
at the entrance. Roots stick out from the ceiling, but no creature stirs.)

Aang: Hello? I&#x27;m looking for a spirit named �Koh.�

(As Aang says the spirit&#x27;s name, some �roots� on the ceiling begin to
move. Aang looks around, sensing movement, but sees nothing. Cut to a
close up of Aang&#x27;s face, that pans slightly left, leaving the right hand
portion of the screen over his shoulder momentarily empty. A moment later
a white face appears, with grey patches around its eyes and luscious,
blood red lips. The face is vaguely clown like. Cut to a close up of the
lips, which smile. Cut to a profile of Aang, his face emotionless. He is
prepared. Suddenly, a huge cockroach like body arcs around Aang and
appears in front of his face. The white, clown like face of Koh is inches
away from Aang. Around the spirit&#x27;s face are eight legs that are attached
to a centipede like body.)

Koh: Welcome!

(Aang&#x27;s face remains inscrutable. Cut to a long shot. The monster hangs
from the ceiling in front of Aang, who bows with his hands clasped in
front of him in a gesture of honor.)

Aang: Thank you.

(Koh wheels around Aang to look at him from the back. His voice is low,
melodic, almost purring. His voice oozes danger.)

Koh: My old friend, the Avatar. It&#x27;s been a long time.

Aang: You know me?
Koh (now facing the camera, away from Aang): How could I forget�

(At this moment Koh&#x27;s face changes from the clown mask to a middle-aged
mustached man. This change occurs with a �winking� effect, as if some sort
of nictating eyelid or membrane closes briefly over the old face to reveal
a new one. It also bears some resemblance to switching slides in a slide
projector.)

Koh: �you! One of your previous incarnations tried (sticking his face
right up to Aang&#x27;s) to slay me! It was eight or nine hundred years ago.
Aang: I didn&#x27;t know that. Why did he� or I� try to kill you?
Koh: Oh...(his face changes to that of a beautiful, flowing haired young
woman) it was something about stealing the face of someone you loved� (the
face changes to the curly tailed blue nose face as Koh begins to laugh
cruelly). Of course, that&#x27;s all behind us. Why should I hold a grudge
against you for something in a past life? After all, you&#x27;re a different
person now. (Sticking his fanged, monkey face up to Aang&#x27;s ear from behind
him) You&#x27;ve come to me� with a new face.

(Aang closes his eye and breathes. Cut to the Mortal World, where his
physical body does the same as his spirit. Zuko looks over at him, then
looks out of the cave.)

Zuko: Guess we&#x27;ll be here awhile.

(A brief shot of the blizzard outside is replaced by the kids flying on
Appa, scanning the ground for signs of Zuko and Aang.)

Princess Yue: Don&#x27;t worry! Prince Zuko can&#x27;t be getting too far in this
weather.
Katara: I&#x27;m not worried they&#x27;ll get away in the blizzard. I&#x27;m worried that
they won&#x27;t.
Sokka: They&#x27;re not gonna die in this blizzard. If we know anything it&#x27;s
that Zuko never gives up. They&#x27;ll survive � and we&#x27;ll find them!

(The crystalline sound that signals to the audience that something related
to the Spirit World is about to happen resurfaces at the end of Sokka&#x27;s
statement.

The screens flashes white, and we are back to Aang&#x27;s interview with the
sinister Face Stealer. Aang stands on the stairs, Koh wraps his body
loosely around him.)

Koh: It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve added a child&#x27;s face to my
collection. (His face is now that of an owl) So� how may I help you?

(During the conversation Koh continues to wrap around Aang, making endless
circles.)

Aang: I need to find the Moon and the Ocean.
Koh: Their spirit names are Tui and La. Push� and Pull� and that has been
the nature of their relationship for all time.
Aang: Please, help me find them. An entire culture could be destroyed if I
don&#x27;t get their help.

(Cut to Koh&#x27;s face, which flips to that of an old man, Aang visible below
him.)

Koh: Oh, you think you need their help? Actually, it&#x27;s quite the other way
around.

(In an instant, Koh turns and bolts to Aang, pressing his face within
inches of Aang&#x27;s. Koh&#x27;s face has changed again from the owl to a blue ogre
like face with red eyes and huge fangs.)

Koh: Someone&#x27;s going to kill them!

(Aang closes his eyes briefly, then opens them to look at Koh.)

Aang: What do you mean? How can I find them and protect them?

Koh (flipping back to his white face): You&#x27;ve already met them, actually.

(Cut to a shot from behind Aang, as Koh has reared himself up, so Aang
must look up to see his face.)

Koh: Tui and La, your Moon and Ocean, have always circled each other in an
eternal dance. They balance each other� push and pull� life and death�
good and evil� yin� and yang.

(Aang&#x27;s eyes open wide, as he gets a flashback of the white and black fish
circling each other in the pond and the vision he got of them turning into
the yin and yang symbol just before he entered the Spirit World.)

Aang (smiling): The koi fish!

(Koh, hearing the emotion in Aang&#x27;s voice, appears instantly with his blue
ogre face in front of the Avatar, ready to take his face. But no luck �
Aang&#x27;s face is once again a model of impassivity.)

Aang: I must be going now.

Koh (flipping to the face of a bald young man): We&#x27;ll meet again.

(Koh recedes back into the shadows, then cut to Aang emerging from Koh&#x27;s
lair. He looks down at his reflection on the ground.)

Aang: The spirits are in trouble. I need to get back to the physical
world.

(Cut to a view over Aang&#x27;s shoulder. Avatar Roku is visible on the
ground.)

Avatar Roku: A friend is here to guide you back.

(Roku fades to the panda form of Hei-Bai, the forest spirit from �The
Spirit World, Winter Solstice Part I�. Aang&#x27;s turns with a smile.)

Aang: Hei-Bai!

(Cut to a wide shot. Hei-Bai is indeed behind him, reared up on his hind
legs. He gets on all fours and Aang jumps onto his neck. Hei-Bai then
begins to take Aang back to where he came in.

The screen flashes white and returns the audience to the beleaguered Water
City. Night has fallen, but the Fire Nation assault continues unabated.
Fire balls now blast the residential section in front of the citadel,
which is protected by the third and final wall. The secondary wall has
been fully compromised and Fire Nation troops and tanks are pouring
through. Water Tribe citizens run through the smoking streets as tanks
smash through everything in their path.

A quick shot of the tank assault is replaced by a shot of the massive full
moon rising behind the Fire Navy fleet. Drawing strength from the full
moon, the defenders manage an uncoordinated counterattack. A group of Fire
Nation soldiers corner a waterbender on a foot bridge over a canal, but
the waterbender breaks the ice bridge and sends the soldiers flying. Cut
to another shot of a tank chasing a waterbender, who turns and melts the
ice under the tank. It sinks as the waterbenders damages the turret with a
powerful jet of water. Cut to a line of defenders atop the third and final
wall. In unison they fire ice daggers at a line of Fire Nation soldiers
below who block them with their shields.

Finally, cut to Master Pakku, who squares off alone against three tanks
which are closely supported by three infantry platoons. Exercising his
mastery over his art, he cuts the treads off all three tanks with jets of
ice. As he cripples the Fire Nation armor, the infantry close in around
him. With a motion he raises them up and encases them all in ice. Then,
mustering all his might, he raises a water tornado, much like Aang used
when his Avatar Spirit was activated in �The Avatar Returns.� Pakku rides
at the pinnacle of the tornado as he brushes aside both fire bolts and
Fire Nation soldiers. He is unstoppable.

Cut to another group of waterbenders who raise up a tank on a block of ice
and throws it at a group of Fire Nation soldiers on war rhinoceros. Cut to
Zhao, a soldier visible over his right soldier. The soldier gets covered
in snow from the impact of the tank that was just thrown, but the guard
heats the snow and it melts off him in a cloud of steam.)

Zhao: We&#x27;ll be following this map to a very special location. And when we
get there� (cut to a shot of Zhao&#x27;s head silhouetted by the moon, a cruel
smile spreading over his face) �we&#x27;re going fishing.

(The screen flashes white again and the crystalline, Spirit World noise is
heard. When the image returns, Hei-Bai and Aang run straight at the
camera. Cut to a profile shot as they reach the paifang where Aang
entered.)

Aang (dismounting): This is where I came in. (He jumps onto the platform
underneath the paifang) But how do I get back?

(In response, Hei-Bai rears up on his hind legs and breathes a pulse of
blue, spiritual energy out of his mouth at Aang, who freezes, engulfed by
the energy and disappears. Cut to the mystical monkey on the ground
nearby, still meditating. He opens his eyes to make a comment.)

Mystical Monkey: Good riddance.

(Cut to a wide shot as Hei-Bai, now in his Spirit Monster form, appears
beside the grouchy monkey and blows him out of the frame with a blast of
spiritual energy. Hei-Bai then transforms back into panda form before the
screen goes white again.

When the image returns, Aang is back in the Water City sanctuary, but the
blue nimbus around him suggests that he has not returned to his body.)

Aang: Momo!

(He walks over to Momo, sleeping on the ground. He does not stir.)

Aang (looking at his hands): Momo? (Realizing his predicament) Oh no!
Where&#x27;s my body?

(He looks around frantically. He stops as a blue ball of energy forms
around and he is lifted or beamed by it right out of the sanctuary valley
and out into the wasteland above. Like a comet he arcs over the frozen
landscape. He is seen by Katara as he flies over them.)

Katara: Look! That&#x27;s gotta be Aang!

(Sokka flips Appa&#x27;s reigns to fly follow the spirit comet. They quickly
arrive at the cave where Aang and Zuko have taken refuge. The comet enters
the cave, briefly illuminating it from inside. Cut to Aang, still bound on
the cave floor. His tattoos stops glowing and Aang wakes up. He struggles
briefly against his bonds, then sits up to face Zuko.)

Zuko: Welcome back.
Aang (threateningly): Good to be back.

(With a mighty breath, he blows Zuko against the wall while simultaneously
propelling himself out of the cave and into the open. He begins to grunt
as he moves forward, caterpillar style, along the ground. Zuko enters the
frame and grabs him by the collar and lifts him up.)

Zuko: That won&#x27;t be enough to escape.

(Appa appears over Zuko&#x27;s head.)

Aang: Appa!

(Appa lands and Zuko drops Aang in the snow. Katara dismounts Appa to face
him again.)

Zuko (assuming a firebending stance): Here for a rematch?
Katara (beginning to waterbend): Trust me, Zuko, it&#x27;s not going to be much
of a match.

(She blocks a fireball that enters the screen just as she finishes her
sentence while Sokka and Yue look on from Appa&#x27;s saddle. She sends a shock
wave of ice hurtling towards him. When it reaches Zuko, she encases him in
a pillar of ice that she raises up high, then drops. Zuko falls to the
ground unconscious. Sokka runs over and cuts Aang&#x27;s bonds.)

Sokka: Hey! This is some quality rope!
Aang: We need to get to the oasis! The spirits are in trouble!

(Aang gets up and runs to Appa. Both Sokka and Aang get onboard, Aang at
the reigns. They are ready to go, but Aang stops and looks over at the
Prince.)

Aang: Wait, we can&#x27;t just leave him here.
Sokka: Sure we can. Let&#x27;s go.
Aang: No, if we leave him, he&#x27;ll die.

(Aang jumps down, grabs Zuko and brings back to Appa.)

Sokka: Yeh, this makes a lot of sense. Let&#x27;s bring the guy who&#x27;s
constantly trying to kill us!

(Appa takes off, then cut back to the black and white fish circling each
other in the pool. A pair of hands reaches into the frame. The right one
grabs the white fish. It struggles, but the hand forces it into a bag held
by the left hand. Cut to Zhao standing up holding the back. The moon,
visible behind him over his left shoulder, colors over a blood red while
the fish struggles in the bag. Cut to commercial break.)

Act III

(The show returns to a close up of the blood red moon. Cut to a pan shot
of the back third of the city. The blood red light washes over it. The
counterattack against the invaders falters as this happens. Shift to Pakku
still riding his water tornado as the blood red light sweeps over him. As
it does, his tornado collapses. Cut to another waterbender whose water
whip disintegrates as the light changes. In another part of the city, a
war rhinoceros is getting washed away, but the force driving the wave
vanishes as the light turns red. The soldier on the war rhinoceros is once
again able to advance on the waterbenders who flee in panic. Cut to a line
of Fire Nation soldiers who fire volley after volley in unison.

Shift to Appa flying silhouetted against the red moon, then cut to Yue
holding her head in pain in Appa&#x27;s saddle.)

Princess Yue: Ugh�
Sokka: Are you okay?
Princess Yue: I feel faint.
Aang (his hand on his head as well): I feel it too. (Aang&#x27;s looks up) The
Moon Spirit is in trouble.
Princess Yue: I owe the Moon Spirit my life.
Sokka: What do you mean?
Princess Yue: When I was born I was very sick and very weak. Most babies
cry when they&#x27;re born�

(Yue&#x27;s story takes over here and we see a little baby with black hair all
bundled up.)

Princess Yue: �but I was born as if I were asleep. My eyes closed.

(Cut to a wider shot of the baby resting on a table, surrounded by healers
who try their art to try and save the child.)

Princess Yue: Our healers did everything they could. They told my mother
and father I was going to die.

(A younger Arnook holds a beautiful, but devastated dark haired womanly
tightly. Cut to Arnook looking up to the Moon, praying.)

Princess Yue: My father pleaded with the spirits to save me� (scene shifts
to the sanctuary where Arnook, his wife and the baby stand by the pool) �
that night, beneath the full moon, he brought me to the oasis and placed
me in the pond. My dark hair turned white, I opened my eyes and began to
cry � and they knew I would live.

(The story ends, and the shot fades back to the present.)

Princess Yue: That&#x27;s why my mother named me Yue, for the moon.

(Cut to a shot zooming backwards of the red moon. Underneath its light
basks Zhao and his entourage by the pond in the oasis.)

Zhao: I am�(raising his fist to the heavens) a legend now! The Fire Nation
will for generations tell stories about the great Zhao who darkened the
moon! They will call me Zhao the Conqueror! Zhao the Moon Slayer! ZHAO THE
INVINCIBLE!

(At this moment Momo jumps onto Zhao&#x27;s head and starts pulling at his face
and chittering.)

Zhao: Huh! Get it off!

(Momo flies off as the guards surround Zhao to help him. He lands on an
outstretched arm � Aang&#x27;s arm. Appa has landed and the kids square off
against Zhao and his men.)

Zhao: Don&#x27;t bother!

(A close up of Zhao zooms backward to show Zhao holding a knife or sword
to the bag with the Moon Spirit in it. Aang drops his staff and raises his
hands in surrender.)

Aang: Zhao! Don&#x27;t!
Zhao: It&#x27;s my destiny� to destroy the Moon� and the Water Tribe.
Aang: Destroying the moon won&#x27;t just hurt the Water Tribe. It will hurt
everyone � including you. Without the moon, everything would fall out of
balance. You have no idea what kind of chaos that would unleash on the
world.
Iroh (from o.c.): He is right, Zhao!

(Cut to a wide shot, that shows Iroh, Aang and Zhao in a triangle around
the pond.)

Zhao (in a bored, lecturing tone): General Iroh, why am I not surprised to
discover your treachery?

(Cut to a close up of Iroh who lowers his hood.)

Iroh: I&#x27;m no traitor, Zhao, the Fire Nation needs the moon too. We all
depend on the balance.

(Cut to Zhao, still holding the weapon to the bag, then back to Iroh who
points a finger at Zhao and thunders�)

Iroh: Whatever you do to that spirit I&#x27;ll unleash on you ten-fold! (He
assumes a firebending stance) LET IT GO, NOW!

(Iroh and Zhao lock eyes for a moment, then Zhao falters, lowering the
bag. He kneels and releases the fish back into the water. The red light of
the moon vanishes, replaced by its normal color. Cut to a close of Zhao&#x27;s
face which is quickly overtaken by a look of madness and desperation. With
a cry of rage he stands and smites the water with a blast of fire. The
frame rate slows as the fire blast passes Iroh, who recoils in horror.
Aang and Momo&#x27;s face is briefly illuminated by the fire. The Avatar looks
up to witness the moon wink out of existence.

Iroh springs instantly to the attack. Crossing the foot bridge, Iroh fires
blast after blast. Zhao blocks one blasts and backs away while Iroh
expertly dispatches Zhao&#x27;s four guards. Zhao looks on in horror as his men
are wiped out by the aging General with such ease and precision. He flees.

Cut back to Iroh standing over the guards who struggle to get up, then
back to the pond where the black fish swims frantically and white, a huge
gash in its side, floats. Iroh gently lifts the white fish from the water,
an expression of sadness on his face. The guards are now gone.)

Princess Yue (on the verge of tears, Sokka&#x27;s hands on her shoulders):
There&#x27;s no hope now. It&#x27;s over.

(Cut to Aang, who&#x27;s sad expression turns to determination as his eyes and
tattoos glow white. His Avatar Spirit speaks through his mouth.)

Aang (voice deep and other-worldly): No, it&#x27;s not over.

(Cut to a wide shot of the five. Aang walks forward into the pond. Katara
moves to follow, but she is stilled by a motion to halt from Iroh. Cut to
a profile shot of the four, Katara, Iroh, Yue and Sokka looking at Aang.
He stands in the middle of the pond, arms in prayer. He looks down at the
black fish, whose eyes and white mark on his spine begin to glow white.
Aang is then seen in profile, his feet in the pond which now glows bright
white. Then he drops into the pond as if the bottom had fallen out of it
and he disappears.

Cut to an overhead shot of the oasis. The water in the pool around the
oasis itself begins to glow a deep blue veined with white. As the effect
spreads, the shot cuts to a view of the citadel area behind the third
wall. The glow spreads from behind the citadel to encompass the entire
citadel area of the city. Cut back to the four who look with wonder at the
awesome power coming to life before them. A huge, incandescent blue wave
rushes under the footbridge as if some huge creature were moving
underneath it. Cut to an overhead of the sanctuary. Appa stands on the
oasis, but he is dwarfed by the creature that rises from the pool, the
citadel and the city visible beyond it.

The blue, white veined creature is a huge fish like being. At its center
is a blue white bubble in which we can see Aang, who spreads his arms
wide. A moment later, the Ocean Spirit, for this is truly he in communion
with the Avatar, duplicates the motion. Cut to a wide, long shot of the
Ocean Spirit from the p.o.v. of Fire Nation soldiers who stand in front of
the last wall. The Ocean Spirit towers over the citadel, it&#x27;s arms still
spread wide, it&#x27;s blue spirit lighting the city like a beacon. The Spirit
begins to move down into the city. Master Pakku and his waterbenders
instantly bow to the floor in honor of their god. Across the canal, some
Fire Nation soldiers raise their spears in defiance, but are swept away by
a wall of water sent by the Ocean Spirit. Cut to Aang inside the body of
the Ocean Spirit, flailing his arms about, directing the power of the
Ocean Spirit against the violator&#x27;s of the Moon Spirit and the Water Tribe
City.

Fire Nation tanks fire blasts of fire at the Ocean Spirit, but they are
absorbed with no effect. The soldiers and tanks are washed away as if they
were toys. The Ocean Spirit passes by the Water Tribe citizens who make
obeisance to their lord. Cut to the Fire Nation army in full retreat,
trying desperately to escape the vengeance of a living Spirit. The Ocean
Spirit reaches the main canal in front of the third wall and melts into
it.

Cut to Zhao running over a foot bridge somewhere in the city. He exits
onto a parapet an is almost hit by a blast of fire that hits the wall in
front of him. As the smoke clears, Zhao looks up to see Zuko on the wall
on the tier up above him.)

Zhao (incredulously): You&#x27;re alive?
Zuko: You tried to have me killed!

(Zuko launches a few fire blasts at Zhao with a cry of anguish, but his
target dodges, rolling along the parapet wall.)

Zhao (with much venom): Yes, I did. You&#x27;re the Blue Spirit � and enemy of
the Fire Nation!

(Cut to a wide shot of the two facing each other. Between them is the
panorama of the city. The Ocean Spirit&#x27;s essence travels down the main
canal in the background.)

Zhao: You freed the Avatar!
Zuko: I had no choice!

(Zuko continues his attack firing volley after volley at Zhao, who breaks
them with his hands held together in a wedge in front of him. As the
blasts subside, Zhao drops his smoking cloak to the ground.)

Zhao: You should have chosen to accept your failure � your disgrace! Then,
at least you could have lived!

(Zhao returns fire. They trade volleys as the fight rages back and forth
in the darkness. At one point Zuko is able to exploit a moment when Zhao
leaves his chest unguarded. Zuko blasts him and Zhao falls off the parapet
wall onto the tier below.

Cut to Iroh placing the dead Moon Spirit fish back into the pond, then to
a view of Katara and Iroh looking with concern into the pond.)

Katara: It&#x27;s too late. It&#x27;s dead.

(Cut to a profile shot of Yue, Iroh and Katara mourning the passing of the
Moon Spirit. Suddenly, Iroh looks up at Yue in wonder.)

Iroh: You have been touched by the Moon Spirit. Some of its life is in
you!
Princess Yue (looking up): Yes, you&#x27;re right. It gave me life. Maybe I can
give it back.

(She gets up and goes to the pond&#x27;s edge.)

Sokka (reaching for her): No! You don&#x27;t have to do that!
Princess Yue (holding his hand behind her, but looking down): It&#x27;s my
duty, Sokka.
Sokka (from o.c. as the camera shows a close up of their clasped hands): I
won&#x27;t let you! Your father told me to protect you!
Princess Yue (looking up): I have to do this.

(The frame rate slows as she releases his hand. She walks to Iroh, who
holds the dead fish in his hands. She puts her palms over the Moon Spirit
which begins to glow. She closes her eyes for the last time, exhales a
final breath, and falls over into Sokka&#x27;s arms.)

Sokka (in despair): NO!

(He places his hands on her cheek and looks away.)

Sokka (softly): She&#x27;s gone. (He hugs her body tightly) She&#x27;s gone.

(Cut to a shot of the outer wall where the Fire Navy ships try desperately
to flee. The bowsprits raise quickly as the ships back out. Cut to an
overhead shot of the water outside the main gate. The incandescent blue of
the Ocean Spirit flows out past the city wall in front of the Fire Navy
fleet. The Ocean Spirit reforms and, towering over the fleet, reaches out.
He pushes two ships back out to see at amazing speed. Cut to a close up of
Aang in the bubble making a slicing motion. Cut to a shot of the Ocean
Spirit making the same slicing motion and making a razor cut through the
bridge tower of Zhao&#x27;s flagship. The cut section slides down to the
foredeck and the ship&#x27;s forward trebuchet is wrecked. Cut to a wide shot
of the Ocean Spirit standing over the fleet. The Spirit raises its arms,
forming a huge wave which upends many vessels and pushes the rest far out
to sea.

The scene shifts back to Sokka cradling Yue&#x27;s inert form. Her body glows
briefly and disappears. The fish in Iroh&#x27;s glows and he drops back in the
water. It begins to swim in the pond. The pond glows white as they look on
and a ghostly rises from it. It coalesces into Yue&#x27;s form, but now she is
dressed in white. Her hair floats around her. Cut to a close of her face,
then a profile shot of her and the others. She addresses, Sokka, her voice
now echoes and is other worldly.)

Princess Yue / Moon Spirit: Goodbye, Sokka. I will always be with you.

(She kisses him, their hands on each other&#x27;s faces. She fades away, but in
the sky, the moon shines bright.

Cut back to a pan left shot of the Ocean Spirit standing at the city
walls. The Ocean Spirit looks up to see the moon alive once again.
Instantly, Aang begins to wilt inside the creature, which dissipates into
the ocean. The Spirit&#x27;s essence flows back to the wall and deposits Aang
atop it. There his glows leaves him as he puts his hand to the side of his
head, spent with the effort.

Cut back to a long shot of Zuko and Zhao continuing to battle on a foot
bridge over a canal. They trade blows, but a series of direct hits from
Zuko lays the Admiral flat. As Zhao tries to get up, he sees the moon over
Zuko&#x27;s shoulder.)

Zhao (in horror): It can&#x27;t be!

(Cut to a long shot of the bridge. The essence of the Ocean Spirit
approaches fast and coalesces around the bridge. It grabs Zhao and begins
to pull him off the bridge. Zhao struggles and Zuko reaches out for him.)

Zuko: Take my hand!

(Zhao tries to reach for it for a moment, but then draws back, an
expression of hate on his face. The Ocean Spirit drags Zhao under the
water and disappears. Fade to white.

The white screens resolves itself into a morning shot of the heavily
damaged Water Tribe City from the citadel. Several figures survey the
scene from below. Cut to Master Pakku standing in front of Katara.)

Master Pakku: I&#x27;ve decided to go to the South Pole. Some other benders and
healers want to join me. (Turning to face Katara) It&#x27;s time we helped
rebuild our sister tribe.
Katara: What about Aang? (Cut to a shot behind Katara and Pakku as they
look at Aang and Momo in the background) He still needs to learn
waterbending.
Master Pakku (turning to her with satisfaction): Well, then he better get
used to calling you �Master Katara.�

(Cut to Sokka and Chief Arnook looking out over the city, backs to the
camera.)

Chief Arnook (wistfully): The Spirits gave me a vision when Yue was born.
I saw� a beautiful, brave young woman�become the Moon Spirit. (Closes his
eyes) I knew this day would come.
Sokka: You must be proud.
Chief Arnook: So proud. And sad.

(They look up to moon, still visible in the morning sky before a fade to
scene among the wreckage of the Fire Navy ships destroyed in the battle.
Among the sunken shifts a small rafts sails. Cut to Iroh and Zuko on the
raft.)

Iroh: I&#x27;m surprised, Prince Zuko, surprised that you are not at this
moment trying to capture the Avatar.
Zuko: I&#x27;m tired.
Iroh (putting a hand on his nephew&#x27;s shoulder): Then you should rest. A
man needs his rest.

(Iroh stands as Zuko lays down. He looks up into the sky, a pained look on
his face. He closes his eyes.

Fade to Aang looking out over the city. The camera view swivels to reveal
Katara behind him. He turns and they look at each other for a moment. They
come together and hug fiercely. A chittering is heard and Katara looks
down to see Momo looking up at them.)

Katara: You too, Momo.
Aang (extending a forearm and laughing): Come here.

(Momo jumps up and Sokka, entering the frame from the left, puts an arm on
Aang&#x27;s shoulder. Cut to a view from behind the four as they look over the
city. With a rumble, Appa rises from below. He floats patiently, awaiting
his comrades so they can depart as the course of events pushes them all
ever onward to their destinies.

Fade to the throne room of the Fire Lord himself. Cut to a view from
behind the Fire Lord, seated on his throne. He is silhouetted by the
flames that wreath his dais. Before him kneels a cruel looking young woman
in a Fire Nation military uniform and a cloak.)

Fire Lord Ozai: Iroh is a traitor and your brother Zuko is a failure. (Cut
to a close up of Azula&#x27;s face as she looks up at her father with a smile)
I have a task for you�

(Fade to white.)

第二十回
北极之战
下部

我居然没能保护好他
你已经尽了全力了
我们会尽一切可能救他回来的
祖寇走不了多远的
我们会找到他的
安昂不会有事的
你说的对
这样吧
模模，你留在这儿
安昂的魂魄回来的话也有个照应
你好？
抱歉打搅您，
你知道我该在哪儿找到月神和海神吗？
走...开
你怎么还在这儿？
是啊，我需要...
没准那个东西能帮你，追它去吧
终于清静了
回来
你好啊，安昂
罗库大师
终于有地方可以避一避了
大师，水族部落正在遭受攻击
我需要找到海神和月神
海和月 是古老的神灵
在世界混沌出开之时，他们就从神界降入了凡间
同样古老的神，我现在只记得一个了
他是谁？
那个神名叫“口”，是个相当危险的人物
人们都叫他“剥脸行者”
在跟他说话的时候你必须非常小心，
千万不要露出任何表情
即便是露出最轻微的表情，他就会偷走你的脸
我终于抓到你了
然而由于这场暴风雪，我不能把你带走
冥冥之中总是有股力量在阻碍
不过你永远也无法了解
你就和我的妹妹一样
对于她来说，一切都是那么的顺利
她是个御火奇才，每个人都宠着她
父王说她是天生幸运
而我，没能胎死腹中就已经是幸运了
我并不需要幸运
更不想要它
我必须一直挣扎着，抗争着，
那些磨练会使我强壮起来
造就了今日的我
不用我提醒您吧，咱们的时间不多了
如果不在满月升起之前战败水族的话，
我们就没有机会赢了
别担心，一切尽在掌握
我即将除掉月亮这个心腹大患
除掉月亮？
要怎么做？
崔上校
准备受死吧
（这位老大还是没能记住赵的名字）
我曾经提过
多年前我偶然发现了一个巨大而惊人的秘密
那就是月之神的凡间化身
不会吧？
那时我还是个年轻的上尉，授命于土强国舒将军麾下
我发现了一座藏于地下的图书馆
在我拆阅的卷轴当中，
其中有一卷有关于月与海的详细图文记载
从而我得知了那些所谓的神是可以被找到并被杀死的
而将他们至于死地就是我的使命
赵，神灵是不能亵渎的
我知道，艾洛，你惧怕神灵
我还听过你游历灵界的传说呢
海和月已经放弃了不朽之身，
他们已经成为这世界的一部分了
现在他们要为自己所做的付出代价
原来是一只卷尾蓝鼻猴啊，吓了我一跳
不要畏惧
不要表露任何感情
你好
我正在找一位叫口的神
欢迎欢迎
谢谢
这不是我的老朋友降世神通嘛
好久不见啊
你认识我？
我怎么能忘了你呢？
就是你！大概是八九百年前，
你的一个前世妄图杀死我！
对此我一无所知
他...或许该叫我干嘛要杀你呢？
或许是因为我偷了你爱人的脸吧
当然了，那都是前尘往事了
我为何为了你前世的过错而忌恨你呢
毕竟，你已经脱胎换骨了
你还带了张新脸来看我
看来我们还要在这儿待上一阵
别担心，这种天气下祖寇走不了多远的
我不是担心他们能够逃离这场暴风雪
恰恰相反我怕他们逃不过
这区区暴风雪是难不倒他们的
要知道祖寇是不会轻言放弃的
他们会活下去的，我们也会找到他们的
我好久都没能弄到一张孩子的脸了
嗯，我该怎样帮助你呢？
我需要找到月神和海神
他们在神界的名字是...
“推”和“拉”
名如其“神”啊
恰如其分的形容了他们永世的关系
拜托了，帮我找到他们
如果没有他们的帮忙，整个水族文明将会被损毁
哦，这么说你需要他们的帮助？
有趣啊，有人也想找到他们，不过...
是要杀掉他们
你这是什么意思
我怎样才能找到并保护他们？
事实上，你已经见过他们了
推和拉，也就是你们所说的月和海
他们一直围着圆圈跳着永恒之舞，
他们相互平衡着
就像推和拉
生与死
好与坏
阴与阳
是那两条鲤鱼
-我必须要走了
-后会有期
月神和海神有麻烦了
我得回到凡间去
你的一位老朋友将指引你会去
“黑白”
这幅地图将指引我们到达那个特殊地点
等咱们到了那儿
就开始捕鱼吧
我是从这儿进来的
但是我要怎么才能会去呢
终于摆脱你了
模模
模模
哦，不好
我的肉身到哪里去了？
看哪，那一定就是安昂
欢迎回来
回来真好啊
想逃跑可没那么容易
阿柏
还嫌输得不够惨？
听我说，祖寇
这回我不会给你还手之机的
嘿，这绳子质量还真好呢
我们得返回那片绿洲
月神和海神有危险
等等，我们不能把他留在这儿
为啥不能
咱们走
不行，不能把他留下来不管，他会被冻死的
是啊，你说的还挺有道理的嘛
哪能随便丢下一直要置我们于死地的人呢
你没事吧
我感觉有点晕
我也感觉到了
月神有危险了
是月神赐予了我生命
你这是什么意思
我出生时体弱多病
大多数的婴儿在出生时都会啼哭
而我出生时却像睡着了一样，双眼紧闭着
御医们绞尽脑汁也没想到方法
他们告诉父王和母后我即将不久于人世
父王祈求神灵救我一命
那晚，在满月之下
他带我来到了那片绿洲，将我放入池塘
我的头发由黑转白
我慢慢睁开了眼睛，并开始哭起来
他们也知道我将活下来
所以我的母后以月神为名
给我起名为“月”
我现在...已经是个传奇了
烈火过将世代相传，伟大的赵上校弑月的丰功伟绩
他们会敬我为征服者
敬我为月神杀手
敬我为无敌战神
呃，快把它给我弄下去，弄下去
你们别费劲了
赵，别那么做
杀掉月神，夷平水族是我的使命
毁掉月神，水族可不是唯一的受害者
也会伤及其他人的
也包括你自己
没有了月亮，万物也将失去平衡
你无法想象世界将变得多么混乱无序
赵，他说的对
艾洛将军，不出所料你果然叛变了
赵，我可不是个叛徒
烈火国同样需要月亮
我们的生存也依赖于万物的平衡
你对那神灵的伤害我将十倍奉还
马上放了它
现在没希望了
一切都结束了
不，还没有结束
你还活着？
你曾试图要杀掉我
是啊，没错
谁让你就是那个“蓝魔”
你是烈火国的敌人
是你放走了降世神通
我别无选择
你该学会接受你的失败
还有你的耻辱
那样你还可以苟且偷生
一切都太晚了
它死了
是月神赐予了你生命
也就是说你是月神生命的延续
是啊，你说的没错
它给了我生命
也许是时候该归还给它了
不行，你不能那么做
索卡，这是我的使命
我不会让你那么做的
你父王让我来保护你
我别无选择
她走了，走了
再见了，索卡
我会一直陪伴在你身边的
这不可能
抓住我的手
我决定了要去南极走一遭
还有一些御水师和水疗师将与我同行
是该帮助我们的兄弟村落重建家园时候了
那安昂该怎么办？
他还需要继续学习御水术
那么他该学着习惯叫你“卡塔拉大师”了
在月出生时，神灵们给了我一个启示
我看见...一位美丽勇敢的姑娘
...化为了月神
我知道这一天迟早会到来的
你一定为她骄傲吧
无比骄傲
但也无比的伤心
祖寇殿下，我很惊讶啊
惊讶你此刻为何不去抓捕神通呢
我累了
那就好好休息休息吧
人都需要休息的
你也来吧，模模
过来
艾洛是个叛徒
而你的皇兄祖寇更是一事无成
这个任务只有交给你了...
