      Scene I

      (Opening shot of Appa flying through a mostly cloudy sky, broken only by a
      few shafts of sunlight that pierces the cloud cover dramatically in
      certain areas. Cut to Aang pacing up and down Appa&#x27;s back, a worried
      expression on his face and then Sokka driving Appa.)

      Sokka: Would you sit down? If we hit a bump you&#x27;ll go flying off! What&#x27;s
      bugging you anyway?
      Aang: It&#x27;s what Avatar Roku said. I&#x27;m supposed to master all four elements
      before that comet arrives.
      Sokka: Well, let&#x27;s see, you&#x27;ve pretty much mastered airbending and that
      only took you 112 years� I&#x27;m sure you can master three more elements by
      next summer.
      Aang (a frightened expression on his face): I haven&#x27;t even started
      waterbending and we&#x27;re still weeks away from the North Pole! What am I
      gonna do!?

      (Aang has put his head in his hands in frustration. Cut to a view of the
      side of Aang&#x27;s body, his left arm now hanging loose. Katara&#x27;s arm appears
      as she grabs his hand. She pulls him to her where she is kneeling in the
      passenger area. Aang kneels beside her as she takes his hands in his.)

      Katara: Calm down. It&#x27;s going to be okay. If you want, I can try and teach
      you some of the stuff I know.
      Aang: You&#x27;d do that?

      (Katara nods her head and smiles. She and Aang then crawl over to the edge
      of the saddle to look down.)

      Katara: We&#x27;ll need to find a good source of water first.
      Sokka: Maybe we can find a puddle for you to splash in.

      (Cut to a shot of a huge waterfall followed by a rapid zoom backward to
      show the river running away from the bottom of the fall. Katara, Sokka,
      Aang and Momo are on the left bank. Cut to close shot of Sokka and Katara.
      He looks a little sour, she looks up in excitement and happiness at the
      mighty waterfall. Screen pans left to show Aang with an expression similar
      to Katara&#x27;s.)

      Sokka: Nice puddle.

      (Cut to a shot of the three from a p.o.v. out in the catch basin of the
      water fall. Appa swoops in overhead, grunts loudly and drops himself into
      the water. Cut to Momo on a rock in the catch basin. The sun is blotted by
      a shadow � the wave of water from Appa&#x27;s messy swan dive. The wave crashes
      over him and he is soaked. Cut to Appa rolling over in the water,
      relaxing. Switch to Aang who has removed everything but his underwear and
      is ready to join the fun. Katara, visible in the background, does not look
      pleased.)

      Aang: Yehhh! Don&#x27;t start without me, boy!
      Katara: Remember the reason we&#x27;re here.

      (Caught at the moment of running to jump in the water, stops and looks
      back to Katara.)

      Aang: Oh right, time to practice waterbending.

      (Cut to a long shot of the three on the bank. Aang pulls up his pants.)

      Sokka: Great. So what am I supposed to do?
      Aang: You could� clean the gunk out of Appa&#x27;s toes?

      (Aang picks up a leafy branch and holds it out to Sokka, who folds his
      arms across his chest.)

      Sokka: So, while you guys are playing in the water, I&#x27;m supposed to be
      hard at work picking the mud out of a giant bison&#x27;s feet?
      Aang (smiling): Mud and bugs!
      Sokka (pausing for a second): Okay.

      (Sokka grabs the branch and walks away, resigned to his task. Cut to Appa
      resting low in the water, where he is blowing bubbles. Fade to a view of a
      Fire Navy ship&#x27;s prow as it breaks the water. As the camera zooms
      backward, a jet of fire erupts off the main deck. Cut to Prince Zuko
      firing blast after blast of fire at his sparring opponent. Suddenly the
      ship tilts to starboard, knocking both combatants off balance.)

      Zuko: Someone&#x27;s changing our course!

      (Cut to a shot of the bridge from Zuko&#x27;s p.o.v., then cut to a shot of
      helmsman at the wheel. The screen pans right as Zuko enters.)

      Zuko: What&#x27;s the meaning of this mutiny? No one told you to change course!

      (Cut to a shot from behind Zuko and the helmsman to reveal Iroh and some
      other crewman playing Pai Sho nearby.)

      Iroh: Actually, someone did. I assure you it is a matter of utmost
      importance, Prince Zuko.
      Zuko: Is it something to do with the Avatar?
      Iroh: Even more urgent. It seems� I&#x27;ve lost my lotus tile.

      (Iroh moves a piece forward on the Pai Sho board. Cut to Zuko, who is
      mystified.)

      Zuko: Lotus tile?
      Iroh: For my Pai Sho game. Most people think the lotus tile insignificant,
      but it is essential for the unusual strategy that I employ.
      Zuko (incensed): You&#x27;ve changed our course for a stupid lotus tile?
      Iroh: See, you, like most people, underestimate its value. Just give me
      ten minutes to check the merchants at this port of call. Hopefully they&#x27;ll
      have the lotus tile in stock and I can get on with my life!

      (Zuko works hard to contain his anger, ultimately releasing a gout of
      flame from his mouth the licks over the ceiling. Cut to a smiling Iroh,
      who is soon clouded with smoke.)

      Iroh: I&#x27;m lucky to have such an understanding nephew.

      (Fade to a shot of Appa&#x27;s paw, with one of the gaps between his toes
      flossed with Sokka&#x27;s leafy branchy. Cut to a wider shot of Appa floating
      on his back, Sokka hard at work on his toes. Appa grunts happily.)

      Sokka: Yeh, don&#x27;t get too happy. You gotta do me next.

      (Cut to Katara and Aang on the river bank. As Katara begins to explain,
      she starts to waterbend the move she is describing.)

      Katara: This is a pretty basic move, but it still took me months to
      perfect, so don&#x27;t be frustrated if you don&#x27;t get it right away. Just push
      and pull the water like this�

      (She begins to bob gracefully back and forth, the water on the river edge
      moving back and forth with her.)

      Katara: The key is getting the wrist movement right.
      Aang (getting up and imitating Katara): Like this?
      Katara: That&#x27;s almost right, if you keep practicing, I&#x27;m sure eventually �

      Aang: Hey, I&#x27;m bending it already!

      (View pans left to show Aang moving around a respectably sized wave of
      water. Cut to a surprised Katara.)

      Katara: Wow, I can&#x27;t believe you got that so quickly. (Looking a little
      unhappy.) It took me two months to learn that move.
      Aang: Well, you had to figure it out on your own. I&#x27;m lucky enough to have
      a great teacher.
      Katara: Thanks.

      (Cut to an overhead shot of Katara and Aang from the p.o.v. of the top of
      the waterfall.)

      Aang: So, what&#x27;s next.
      Katara: This is a more difficult move. I call it �streaming the water.�

      (Cut to closer view of the pair. Katara moves her hands and pulls out of a
      stream of water from the river and begins to loop it around.)

      Katara: It&#x27;s harder than it looks so don&#x27;t be disappointed if�

      (Cut to a wider shot that shows Aang has already mastered this move. He is
      moving around his stream of water as if it were a toy as Katara stands
      motionless. After a few minutes of frolicking, cut to Katara who
      definitely looks sour. She drops her water stream. Aang plays with his for
      a few more seconds and then dumps his back into the river.)

      Katara: Nice work, though the over-the-head flare was unnecessary.
      Aang: Sorry. Well, don&#x27;t stop now, keep&#x27;em coming!
      Katara: Well, I kinda know this one other move, but it&#x27;s pretty hard. I
      haven&#x27;t even totally figured it out yet. The idea is to create a big,
      powerful wave�

      (Katara concentrates, raises a blob of water out of the river, but it
      falls back upon itself when Katara&#x27;s concentration collapses. Aang sets up
      to try.)

      Aang: So, like this?

      (He raises his hands and a huge wall of water shoots up into the air. Cut
      to Sokka with the wave building visibly behind him. He turns and his eyes
      go wide.)

      Sokka: Aang!

      (He gets soaked as the wave breaks over he and Appa. Cut to Sokka coming
      up out of the water since he had been washed off Appa. Cut back to Katara
      and Aang.)

      Aang: Looks like I got the hang of that move! What else ya got?
      Katara (crossly): That&#x27;s enough practicing for today.
      Sokka: Yeh, I&#x27;ll say! (Cut to a shot of a bunch of bags floating down the
      river.) You just practiced our supplies down the river!
      Aang: Uhhh� sorry. I&#x27;m sure we can find somewhere to replace all this
      stuff.
      Sokka (sinking back under the water): Ugh, it was hard enough when you
      were just an airbender.

      (Cut to a pan shot of a port village, then shift to the kids walking down
      a market street. Various shots of tough looking sailors, merchants and
      shady types run past each other. In the background a big man is holding up
      a much smaller one for an unknown reason, as the smaller one yells,
      �Please, put me down!� Another shopkeeper in blue is addressing a crowd,
      holding up a sack and asking, �Who&#x27;s brave enough to look into this bag?�
      Fade to Katara and Aang sitting in a shop window. Sokka exits the shop.)

      Sokka: We&#x27;ve got exactly three copper pieces left from the money that King
      Bumi gave us. Let&#x27;s spend it wisely.
      Aang: Uhh, make that two copper pieces, Sokka. I couldn&#x27;t say no to this
      whistle!

      (Aang produces a white whistle in the shape of a bison from behind his
      back. Aang draws in a great breath and blows into it, cut to Sokka with
      his fingers in his ears to stop the sound he believes is coming. Nothing
      happens � only the sound of rushing air.)

      Sokka: It doesn&#x27;t even work. (Momo chitters into Aang&#x27;s ear as his master
      stops blowing into it.) See, even Momo thinks it&#x27;s a piece of junk.
      Katara: No offense, Aang, but I&#x27;ll hold the money from now on.

      (Aang looks guilty and then hands over the money to Katara. Fade to an
      overhead pan right shot of the port. Cut then to one of the larger ships
      at the dock where one of the crew is soliciting customers.)

      Pirate Barker: Earth Nation! Fire Nation! Water Nation! So long as
      bargains are your inclination, you&#x27;re welcome here! Don&#x27;t be shy, come one
      by!

      (Cut to Aang, Katara and Aang walking by the ship. The pirate runs right
      up to them, but they keep walking.)

      Pirate Barker: Oh! You there! I can see by your clothing that you&#x27;re world
      traveling types. Perhaps I can interest you in some exotic curios?

      (Aang pops back into the frame at this.)

      Aang: Sure! What are curios?
      Pirate Barker (pausing): I&#x27;m not entirely sure, but we got&#x27;em!

      (The pirate takes Aang by the shoulders and bustles them onto to the ship.
      Cut to the three looking around the Pirate&#x27;s hold, gawping at their wares.
      Katara is momentarily mesmerized by a stone monkey richly jeweled with
      large, blood red rubies. Then from o.c., a sinister voice is heard.)

      Pirate Captain: I&#x27;ve never seen such a fine specimen of lemur. That beast
      would fetch me a hefty sum, if you&#x27;d be interested in bartering.

      (In the midst of speaking, the Pirate Captain enters from a dark doorway.
      He wears a wide brim hat and has a huge green parrot like creature on his
      shoulder, which screams several times when the Captain is finished. Cut to
      Aang, who hugs Momo protectively.)

      Aang (defensively): Momo&#x27;s not for sale.

      (Cut to Katara, who walks over to a scroll rack. One of them, the
      thinnest, has the water symbol on its end. She opens it and sees the
      instructions on how to perform various waterbending moves. Her eyes light
      up and she draws an intake of breath as the view zooms backs a bit to
      reveal Aang behind her.)

      Katara: Look at this, Aang! It&#x27;s a waterbending scroll. Check out these
      crazy moves!
      Aang (to the Pirate Captain): Where did you get a waterbending scroll?

      (Cut to a view of the open scroll. The Captain&#x27;s hand suddenly slams down
      upon it. Cut to a wider shot of Aang and Katara, the Captain between them
      rolling up the scroll and smiling.)

      Pirate Captain: Let&#x27;s just say I got it up north at a most reasonable
      price. Free!

      (Cut to a view of the Pirate Captain replacing the scroll in the rack,
      Katara visible in the background eyeing the scroll hungrily. Cut to Sokka
      looking at some merchandise, then he turns around, puzzling something
out.)

      Sokka: Waaait a minute�sea-loving traders�with suspiciously acquired
      merchandise...and pet reptile birds�You guys are pirates!
      Pirate Barker (putting his arm around Sokka&#x27;s shoulders and smiling): We
      prefer to think of ourselves as high risk traders.

      (Cut to Katara looking at the two measly copper pieces in her hand. She
      turns to the Pirate Captain.)

      Katara: So, how much for the, uh, �traded� scroll?
      Pirate Captain: I&#x27;ve already got a buyer, a nobleman in the Earth Kingdom.
      Unless, of course, you kids have 200 gold pieces on ya right now?

      (Aang and Katara withdraw slightly to speak in private. Aang puts his hand
      out.)

      Aang: I know how to deal with these guys, Katara, pirates love to haggle.
      (She gives him the 2 copper pieces). Watch and learn. Aang walks over the
      Pirate Captain.) What say to the price of� one copper piece!

      (Aang holds the copper piece up to the Captain, a wide grin on his face.)

      Pirate Captain: Hahaha! The price is 200 gold pieces. I don&#x27;t haggle on
      items this rare.
      Aang: Okay � two copper pieces!
      Pirate Captain: It&#x27;s not as amusing the second time, boy.
      Katara: Aang, can we get out of here, I feel like we&#x27;re getting weird
      looks.
      Aang (to the Pirate Captain): Aye, we be castin&#x27; off now!

      (Aang grabs his staff and follows Katara out. Cut to the three leaving the
      ship.)

      Aang: What was that all about, Katara.
      Sokka: Yeh, I was just starting to browse through their boomerang
      collection.
      Katara (hugging herself protectively): I&#x27;ll just feel a lot better once we
      get away from here.

      (Cut to wide shot showing the dock and the prow of the pirate vessel. The
      pirate who solicited them originally runs across the deck shouting.)

      Pirate Barker: Hey you, get back here!

      (Cut to the group who turn to look back.)

      Aang: Well, well, look who&#x27;s come to their senses. Told ya the haggling
      would pay off.

      (Cut to the groups p.o.v. Like angry bees from a beehive the pirates are
      exiting their ship to come after Aang, Katara and Sokka. Suddenly, the
      group is faced with a dozen or so well armed and obviously angry pirates.
      Cut to a terrified Aang, with the others behind him and obviously
      frightened as well. Fade to commercial break.)

      Scene II

      (The show returns to the face off. The pirates crowd around the kids,
      yelling things like, �There they are!�, �Get&#x27;em!� and �Nobody&#x27;s goin&#x27;
      nowhere!�

      Katara: I�I don&#x27;t think these pirates are here to trade with us!

      (The kids run off with the pirates in pursuit.)

      Random Pirate: Get back here!

      (The kids run down an alley and the pirates split into two groups. One
      follows the kids while the other, led by the pirate salesmen, goes in
      another direction.)

      Pirate Barker: This way! Let&#x27;s cut&#x27;em off!

      (Cut to the three kids turning the corner around a building, pirates in
      pursuit. As he rounds the corner Sokka skids and yells �whoa!�, but they
      keep going. As she passes the corner, Katara waterbends some water from a
      nearby stall onto the ground and freezes it. The lead pirate slips and
      hits the ground. Cut to the same cabbage dealer seen in �The King of
      Omashu.� He is nuzzling a cabbage happily. He puts the cabbage in his
      portable stand, which is full of cabbages and begins to wheel it away. As
      he does, Sokka and Katara run by, bumping the cart and knocking off
      cabbages. The shopkeeper saves the cabbages from hitting the ground, but
      then Aang launches himself between the cart&#x27;s canopy and the cabbages and
      emerges out the other side. As he does, he turns and airbends the cart up
      the street to strike the pursuing pirates. The cart disappears in a clouds
      of dust as do the pirates. The cabbage dealer enters the view, back to the
      screen and clearly irate.)

      Cabbage Merchant: My cabbages! (Turning to the camera) This place is worse
      than Omashu!

      (Cut to a view of the pirates who just got knocked out by the cabbage
      cart. They groan pitifully. Cut to the kids running down another alley,
      but when they turn the next corner they are met by the pirate salesmen and
      his men. The kids run back the way they came, the pirates again in
      pursuit.)

      Random Pirate: I hope that lemur of yours has nine lives!

      (The kids turn into a blind alley. They turn around to face their
      pursuers. Cut the to Pirate Barker and his mates now blocking the
      entrance.)

      Pirate Barker (dual wielding a pair of long knives): Now, who gets to take
      the steel of my blade first?
      Aang: No thanks!

      (Aang airbends a huge gust of wind at the Pirates, who are blinded with
      dust and disoriented. Aang begins to rush forward while opening his
      glider. Katara and Sokka run along behind and then latch onto to Aang&#x27;s
      legs.)

      Aang: Hold on tight!
      Katara: Aang, I thought we were running away from the pirates!
      Aang: Just hang on!

      (They have trouble gaining altitude at first, in fact they bounce off the
      heads of many of the pirates they are trying to escape. They eventually
      get airborne, however, and look back to see the pirates and the port
      receding behind them. Fade back to the waterfall where the three and Momo
      stand once again on the river bank. Cut to a closer shot of the three as
      Aang closes his glider.)

      Aang: I used to kinda look up to pirates, but those guys are terrible.
      Katara (smiling): I know, that&#x27;s why I took � this!

      (Cut to a close up of the waterbending scroll in Katara outstretched hand.
      Aang gets up, an unhappy look on his face.)

      Aang: No way.
      Katara: Isn&#x27;t it great?
      Sokka (entering from right): No wonder they were trying to hack us up. You
      stole their waterbending scroll.
      Katara (self satisfied): I prefer to think of it as �high-risk trading.�
      Aang (smiling): Haha! Good one, Katara.
      Katara: Sokka, where do you think they got it? They stole it from a
      waterbender.
      Sokka: It doesn&#x27;t matter. You put all of our lives in danger just so you
      could learn some stupid, fancy splashes!
      Katara: These are real waterbending forms. You know how crucial it is for
      Aang to learn waterbending.
      Sokka (turning and walking away): Whatever.
      Aang: Well, what&#x27;s done is done. We have it. We might as well learn from
      it.

      (Screen cuts to long shot of Aang and Katara on river bank as Aang speaks.
      When he is through, the camera pans up to the sky, where the scene fades
      to another sky scene, but this one with seagulls. When the view pans back
      down, Zuko&#x27;s ship is docked at the village the kids have just left. Cut to
      Zuko and Iroh in the market area. Zuko&#x27;s arms are folded across his chest
      and he stares into the camera, clearly unhappy.)

      Iroh: I&#x27;ve checked all the shops on this pier. Not a lotus tile in the
      entire marketplace.
      Zuko (turning to shout at his uncle): It&#x27;s good to know this trip was a
      complete waste of time for everyone!
      Iroh: Quite the contrary. I always say the only thing better than finding
      something you were looking for, is finding something you weren&#x27;t looking
      for at a great bargain!

      (In the middle of Iroh&#x27;s saying, a parade of Fire Nation soldiers walks by
      carrying armloads of merchandise that Iroh has just bought. One of them is
      some kinds of brass musical instrument.)

      Zuko: You bought a sumki horn?
      Iroh: For music night on the ship. Now, if we only had some woodwinds.

      (As they begin walking down the dock, cut to a view of the pirate ship.)

      Iroh: This place looks promising!

      (Cut to a view of the red jeweled monkey Katara had eyed earlier. Cut to
      Iroh&#x27;s face , Zuko visible in the background.)

      Iroh: Ooo! That is handsome! Wouldn&#x27;t it look magnificent in the galley?

      (Cut to a view from behind the Pirate Captain, who is speaking with the
      Pirate Barker that the kids escaped from a few scenes before. Zuko listens
      to their conversation. Meanwhile, Iroh picks up the jeweled monkey with a
      huge grin on his face.)

      Pirate Barker: We lost the Water Tribe girl and the little bald monk she
      was traveling with.
      Zuko (walking over): This monk, did he have an arrow on his head?

      (Iroh makes monkey noises in the background, then fade to a shot of the
      open waterbending scroll. Katara begins to speak from o.c.)

      Katara: I just want to try this one move first and then it&#x27;s all yours.

      (Cut to wider shot of Aang and Katara by the river, with Aang now holding
      open he scroll for her. She leans backward, assuming the waterbending
      stance prescribed in the scroll.)

      Katara: �The single water whip�� looks doable.

      (She raises a stream of water and whips it around, but it hits her in the
      forehead, leaving a bruise. Sokka, visible over her shoulder sitting cross
      legged on a rock, laughs.)

      Katara: What&#x27;s so funny?
      Sokka: I&#x27;m sorry, but you deserve that. (Screen expands to show Aang on
      the left. Sokka turns to him.) You&#x27;ve been duped. She&#x27;s only interested in
      teaching herself.
      Katara (guiltily): Aang will get his turn once I figure out the water
whip!

      (She tries again, but the whip behaves erratically and unintentionally
      zaps Momo, who screams at her in protest. Cut to wide shot of Katara in
      the foreground, Aang in the background.)

      Katara (angry): Why can&#x27;t I get this stupid move!
      Aang (walking to the river): You&#x27;ll get it.

      (Katara looks displeased at this pronouncement, undoubtedly expecting Aang
      to show her up once again. Cut to Aang making the water whip correctly on
      the first try.)

      Aang: You just gotta shift your weight through the stances� (He gracefully
      manipulates the whip for a few seconds and then drops it back into the
      river.) There. See, the key to bending is�
      Katara (angry, shaking her fists in front of her): Will you PLEASE shut
      your air hole! Believe it or not, your infinite wisdom gets a little old
      sometimes. Why don&#x27;t we just throw the scroll away since you&#x27;re so
      naturally gifted! (She looks over at Sokka, who is not impressed.) What?

      (She looks at Aang, who is frightened and looks on the verge of tears.)

      Katara (now abashed): Omigosh, Aang, I&#x27;m so sorry. I don&#x27;t know what came
      over me. But, you know what, it won&#x27;t happen again. (She rolls up the
      scroll and hands it to Aang.) Here, this is yours. I don&#x27;t want to have
      anything to do with it anymore.
      Aang: It&#x27;s okay, Katara

      (Cut to Sokka still sitting on the rock, Momo in the foreground rubbing
      his sore behind where the whip struck him.)

      Sokka: What about Momo? He&#x27;s the real victim here.
      Katara (stroking his ears as he chitters): I&#x27;m sorry Momo.
      Sokka (clearly milking the situation): And� what about me? There was that
      time you �
      Katara (angrily again): No more apologies!

      (Fade back to a shot of Zuko&#x27;s ship. The prows opens and deploys a small
      cutter craft that steams away. Fade to a scene on the river where the
      cutter craft and the pirate ship are moving up the river in parallel. Cut
      to a scene on the deck of one of the ships. Zuko and the Pirate Captain,
      green parrot still on his shoulder, are in conversation.)

      Pirate Captain: Shouldn&#x27;t we stop to search the woods?
      Zuko: We don&#x27;t need to stop. They stole a waterbending scroll, right?
      Pirate Captain: Uh huh.
      Zuko: Then they&#x27;ll be on the water.

      (Fade to a night scene, the camera focused on the full moon in the sky.
      The view pans down to the kids camps, fire still blazing. The boys are
      asleep, but Katara is awake. She gets up and silently removes the scroll
      from Aang&#x27;s bag. She backs guiltily away from the camp, turning around
      only to be confronted by Momo&#x27;s luminescent green eyes. He is sitting on
      some sort of tree trunk as he chitters at her.)

      Katara (whispering): Shh! Momo, go back to sleep.

      (She walks by and he chitters again, but she �sh&#x27;s� him once more. Fade to
      Katara by the river practicing, but failing to produce, the water whip.)

      Katara (frustrated): Shoot! Come on water, work with me here!

      (She lifts a globe of water out of the river and tries to manipulate it,
      each of her mistakes being punctuated by a verbal exclamation of �okay�,
      �stupid!� or something else. Cut to Zuko and the Pirate Captain on the
      deck of one of their ships, who are clearly now close enough to hear this
      noise. They look at each other, then cut back to Katara wielding a stream
      of water.)

      Katara: Okay, Katara, shift your weight through the stances�(the stream
      collapses)�ugh!

      (Suddenly she hears the noise of grinding metal. She runs over to a row of
      bushes on her left and parts them to reveal Zuko&#x27;s cutter craft now
      beached on the river bank. She turns to run, but there stands a pirate,
      who grabs her.)

      Katara: No, let go of me!

      (She bends a water whip around and smacks the pirate in the face. He lets
      her go, but she runs right into Zuko&#x27;s arms, who holds her fast.)

      Zuko: I&#x27;ll save you from the pirates.

      (Cut to commercial break.)

      Scene III

      (When the show returns, Katara is bound to the trunk of a small tree, her
      hands behind the trunk. She is surrounded by the pirates and Zuko&#x27;s
      soldiers.)

      Zuko: Tell me where he is and I won&#x27;t hurt you or your brother.
      Katara: Go jump in the river!
      Zuko (trying to be reasonable): Try to understand, I need to capture to
      restore something I&#x27;ve lost. My honor. Perhaps in exchange I can restore
      something you&#x27;ve lost.

      (Cut to a shot of Katara&#x27;s neck, where suddenly her mother&#x27;s necklace
      appears. The shot expands to reveal Zuko holding it in place and shock
      moving across Katara&#x27;s features. Zuko walks away with the necklace.)

      Katara: My mother&#x27;s necklace! How did you get that?
      Zuko: I didn&#x27;t steal it, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re wondering. Tell me where he
      is.
      Katara: No!
      Pirate Captain (walking forward): Enough of this necklace garbage. You
      promised the scroll!
      Zuko (producing the scroll and making fire in his hand beneath it): I
      wonder how much money this is worth? (The pirates gasp and some cry,
      �no!�). A lot, apparently. Now you help me find what I want, you&#x27;ll get
      this back and everyone goes home happy. Search the woods for the boy and
      meet back here.
      Pirate Captain (sullen): Fine.

      (Cut back to a dawn scene at the waterfall. A shot of the waterfall is
      replaced by Aang and Sokka still sleeping. Sokka rolls over, starting to
      wake. He notices Katara&#x27;s empty sleeping bag in the foreground.)

      Sokka: Huh? Where did she go? (Cut to Sokka searching Aang&#x27;s bag, Aang
      waking up in the foreground.) I don&#x27;t believe it.
      Aang (yawning): What&#x27;s wrong.
      Sokka: She took the scroll! She&#x27;s obsessed with that thing. It&#x27;s just a
      matter of time before she gets us all in deep �

      (He is cut off when his hands get wrapped in a sling thrown from
      off-screen. He is pulled right off his sleeping bag screaming. He lands on
      the ground and is faced by a pirate who throws another sling at him. He
      rolls out of the way, picks up his spear and charges the intruder. Aang,
      in the background, turns to see a huge beefy pirate hefting two crossbows
      with a net tied between them. He aims and fires. Aang fires an air ball at
      the approaching net, but the air passes right through it. The net rolls
      him up into a nice neat bundle and he is thrown backwards onto the ground,
      where another pirate begins dragging him away. They instantly leave Sokka
      alone, who gets up, his pride hurt.)

      Random Pirate: I got him, come on!
      Sokka: Oh, what? I&#x27;m not good enough to kidnap?

      (He is answered by another net which scoops him up. He screams as they
      drag him towards the camera and then o.c. Cut to a view of the pirate ship
      beached on the river bank, the pirates, Zuko and his men lined up facing
      each other. Katara is still bound to the tree, Iroh standing next to her.
      The pirates have Sokka and Aang tied up, Zuko holds the scroll.)

      Zuko: Nice work.
      Katara: Aang, this is all my fault.
      Aang: No, Katara it isn&#x27;t.
      Iroh: Yeh, it kind of is.

      (Cut to Zuko&#x27;s face.)

      Zuko: Give me the boy.
      Pirate Captain: You give us the scroll.
      Sokka: You&#x27;re really gonna hand over the Avatar for a stupid piece of
      parchment!?
      Zuko (pointing at Sokka): Don&#x27;t listen to him! He&#x27;s trying to turn us
      against each other.
      Pirate Captain (looking at Aang): Your friend is the Avatar?
      Sokka (appearing at the Captain&#x27;s side): Sure is, and I&#x27;ll bet he&#x27;ll fetch
      a lot more on the black market then that fancy scroll.
      Zuko: Shut your mouth, you water tribe peasant!
      Aang (concerned): Yeh, Sokka, you really should shut your mouth�
      Sokka (looking sweetly at the obviously very interested pirates): I&#x27;m just
      sayin&#x27;, it&#x27;s bad business sense. Just imagine how much the Fire Lord would
      pay for the Avatar. You guys would be set for life!

      (Cut to a wide shot of the two opposing groups. The Pirate Captain points
      to Zuko.)

      Pirate Captain: Keep the scroll! We can buy a hundred with the reward we
      will get for the kid.

      (The pirates begin to walk away with the kids. Cut to Zuko&#x27;s face.)

      Zuko: You&#x27;ll regret breaking a deal with me!

      (Zuko and the guards on either side of him unleash a torrent of flame,
      which bathes the ground underneath the pirates who jump out the way.
      General melee begins. The Pirate Salesmen jumps into the midst of the
      firebenders with a cry. Zuko and his men bear down on the still bound Aang
      and Sokka. As the get near, four pirates jump into the frame to defend
      their captives. They drop smoke bombs and the battlefield instantly
      becomes a foggy mess. The remaining Fire Nation soldiers approaches the
      edge of the crowd and are instantly pulled in by the arms of pirates
      emerging from the smoke. Cut to an overhead shot of Katara still bound to
      the tree. Momo climbs down the trunk and chew open her bonds.)

      Katara (smiling): Thanks, Momo. I owe you a bushel of apples.

      (Cut to Aang running through the smoke, coughing, his hands still bound.
      Near misses with a throwing star and a spear cut Aang&#x27;s bonds. Cut to the
      exterior of the smoke cloud where Zuko emerges. He puts the waterbending
      scroll through his waistband on his back. He turns around to just avoid a
      sword stroke. Zuko assumes a firebending stance, then cut to the Pirate
      Captain pointing a sword at him. They struggle, but no one gains
      advantage. From off-screen a sling removes the scroll from Zuko&#x27;s
      waistband. Cut to the pirate who threw the sling. Momo intercepts the
      sling as it returns to the pirate and takes the scroll, flying o.c.. Momo
      in turn is pursued by the Pirate Captain&#x27;s green parrot, which tackles
      Momo in mid-air. The lemur drops the scroll and it falls back down into
      the smoke filled battlefield, jets of flame erupting from it at various
      points. Cut to Sokka crawling on the ground, the sound of steel on steel
      all around him. Out of the smoke a machete buries itself in the ground in
      front Sokka, scaring him. He uses its blade to cut his arm bonds.)

      Sokka: Aang, are you there?

      (Cut to Aang airbending himself up over the smoke cloud, then dropping
      back down.)

      Aang: I&#x27;m over here, follow my voice!
      Sokka (from o.c.): Where? I can&#x27;t find you!
      Aang: I&#x27;m right here!

      (The Avatar assumes an airbending stance and blows away the smoke from the
      immediate area to reveal a mix of Fire Nation soldiers and pirate in
      combat. They freeze and look at him. He closes the smoke back up around
      them.)

      Aang: Uhh, never mind! I&#x27;ll find you!

      (Cut to Sokka crawling out of the smoke and getting up. As he does, Aang
      jumps out of the smoke over Sokka&#x27;s head.)

      Aang: Run!

      (They run towards the pirate ship, which Katara is trying to push off the
      beach.)

      Aang: Katara! You&#x27;re okay!
      Katara: Help me get this boat back in the water so we can get out of here!

      (All three begin to push on the boat, but nothing happens. They stop and
      look up at the prow.)

      Sokka: We need a team of rhinos to budge this ship.
      Aang: A team of rhinos�or two waterbenders.

      (Katara looks at Aang and smiles. Cut to Aang and Katara pulling the river
      back and forth up the beach, slowly raising the water level around the
      prow. The ship floats.)

      Katara: Everybody in!

      (Cut back to the duel between Zuko and the Pirate Captain. Iroh breaks it
      up.)

      Iroh: Are you so busy fighting you cannot see your own ship has set sail?
      Zuko: We have no time for your proverbs, Uncle!
      Iroh (pointing o.c.): It&#x27;s no proverb.

      (Cut to a quick shot of the pirate ship sailing downriver, then back the
      Captain, Zuko and Iroh.)

      Pirate Captain: Bleeding hog-monkeys! (He runs o.c..)
      Zuko: Haha!

      (Cut to pirate ship, now far away, as the screen pans left to reveal
      Zuko&#x27;s ship following it, loaded with pirates, one of whom moves to moon
      Zuko and his Uncle, but is cut off by shift back to Zuko and Iroh.)

      Zuko: Hey! That&#x27;s my boat! (He runs o.c.)
      Iroh (scratching his chin): Maybe it should be a proverb.
      Zuko (from o.c.): Come on, Uncle!

      (Cut to shot of Aang&#x27;s back. He looking astern at the pirates as the close
      in. He turns to yell forward.)

      Aang: Sokka! Can&#x27;t you make it go any faster?

      (Cut to Aang&#x27;s p.o.v, showing Sokka&#x27;s back as he stands at the wheel of
      the ship).

      Sokka: I don&#x27;t know how. This thing wasn&#x27;t made by the water tribe.

      (Cut back to side view of Aang, where the smokestack of the cutter ship is
      visible in the background. The pirates are passing them. When they draw
      parallel, pirates begins jumping onto the kid&#x27;s ship. Cut to a view of the
      aft deck, where Katara faces the camera in the background and two pirates
      advance on her in the foreground. As she backs up, Aang, who is visible on
      top of the cabin, waterbends a huge wave onto the deck that washes one of
      the pirates overboard. Katara, afraid at first, but then gaining
      confidence and determination in her continence, creates a water whip and
      smacks the other one overboard. Cut to Katara, beaming, Aang visible in
      the background still on top of the cabin.)

      Aang: Hey, you did the water whip!
      Katara: I couldn&#x27;t have done it without your help!

      (Cut to Sokka on the bridge with a beefy pirate and the pirate salesmen on
      him.)

      Sokka: Will you two quit congratulating each other and help me out!

      (Momo flies across the screen at this point, closely pursued by the
      Captain&#x27;s parrot. The pursuit ends when Momo traps the parrot by wrapping
      him in the pirate vessel&#x27;s black flag. Cut back to Sokka being held aloft
      by the beefy pirate. Sokka screams as the pirate throws him into the sail
      in front of him. Sokka falls with a thud to the deck below.)

      Pirate Barker: That&#x27;s good!

      (Aang drops into the scene from the left and throws the Pirate Salesmen
      threw the guard rail and o.c. with a huge blast of air. He twirls the
      beefy pirate around on a whirlwind of air for a few minutes before
      ejecting him high into the air. He comes back down in the background,
      landing with a splash in the river. Cut to a view from the floor of the
      foredeck, Sokka&#x27;s supine form in the foreground, Katara and Aang visible
      on the bridge deck above. Aang jumps down to Sokka.)

      Katara (pointing forward): Aang, look!

      (The sound of falling water is heard as she speaks. Cut to p.o.v. down the
      river looking back upriver at the ships. Camera zooms out to reveal that
      they are rapidly approaching a large waterfall. Cut back to Aang as the
      screen expands to reveal the Pirate Barker behind him.)

      Aang: Oh, no!

      (The Pirate Barker draws his blade, making a distinctive sound. Aang turns
      to face him and draws his bison whistle in response. He blows the whistle
      furiously to no seeming effect. Cut back to the unimpressed Pirate Barker,
      who is promptly round-kicked overboard by Sokka who has just entered the
      shot from the right.)

      Sokka (tapping the side of his head): Have you lost your mind!? This is no
      time for flute practice!

      (Cut to Katara and Aang looking over the starboard railing at the rapidly
      approaching waterfall. Cut to a view of the prow almost at the lip of the
      fall. Katara speaks from o.c.)

      Katara: We can stop the boat! Aang, together, push and pull the water!

      (Cut to Katara and Aang on the foredeck waterbending in unison, making
      pushing and pulling motions. Cut to overhead shot of the boat, which is
      now turning around right at the lip of the fall.)

      Katara: It&#x27;s working! It&#x27;s slowing down!

      (Cut to Aang and Katara bending, then back to the ship which is now at a
      90 degree angle to the lip of the fall and motionless. Cut back a side
      shot of Aang and Katara, Sokka in the background. Beyond Sokka, the
      smokestack of the cutter can be seen growing larger.)

      Katara: We&#x27;re doing it!
      Sokka (pointing to the cutter): But we have another problem!

      (The camera zooms over the railing to show a close of the cutter bearing
      down on the pirate ship. Cut to a view of the pirate ship hovering at the
      lip of the fall from the p.o.v. of someone sitting on the river bank. From
      the left the cutter enters the scream and rams the pirate ship amidships.
      Cut back to the kids who yell �whoa!� at he impact, which lifts the
      starboard side of the pirate ship out of the water and, consequently,
      making the ship list badly to port. The list rapidly becomes so bad that
      the three fall off the ship and over the falls, the pirate ship falling
      behind them. Cut to the three falling. Appa swoops in and they land on his
      backs. He exits just in time to avoid the falling pirate ship. Cut to a
      wide shot of the waterfall from its base. The pirate ship disintegrates
      when its hits the bottom in a cloud of water and debris. Appa and the kids
      swoop out of the scene. Cut to a close up of the bison whistle, then zoom
      backwards to reveal the kids on Appa&#x27;s back, Momo landing on Sokka&#x27;s
      shoulder in the background.)

      Aang: I knew a bison whistle would come in handy. Thanks, Appa.
      Sokka: Yeh, we owe ya one.

      (Cut to Appa&#x27;s face. He grunts back to them. Then cut to Zuko running up
      to the river bank near the waterfall, Iroh huffing and puffing behind
him.)

      Zuko: My boat!
      Iroh (finally regaining his breath): Hehe, Prince Zuko, you&#x27;re really
      going to get a kick out of this. The missing lotus tile was in my sleeve
      the whole time!

      (He produces the missing lotus tile with a huge smile on his face. Cut to
      wide shot of Iroh still holding out the piece, Zuko trying to control his
      breathing and his temper. Cut back to Iroh holding the piece, which
      disappears fast as lightning when Zuko snatches it from him. Zuko throws
      it as far as he can. Cut to the pirates floating downstream. The piece
      lands on the Pirate Barker&#x27;s head. Cut to a long shot of Aang breaking
      through the clouds.)

      Katara: Aang, I still owe you an apology. (Cut to the three in the saddle,
      Katara kneeling and looking down at nothing.) You were just so good at
      waterbending without really trying. I got so competitive that I put us all
      in danger. I&#x27;m sorry.
      Aang: That&#x27;s okay, Katara.
      Katara: Besides, who needs that stupid scroll anyway.

      (Pan left to reveal Sokka&#x27;s hand holding the scroll.)

      Sokka: Is that really how you feel?
      Katara: The scroll!

      (She reaches for it, but Sokka pulls it away and gives her the heisman
      with his other hand.)

      Sokka: First, what did you learn?
      Katara: Stealing is wrong. (She takes the scroll.) Unless it&#x27;s from
      pirates!
      Aang: Haha! Good one, Katara.

      (Cut to Appa flying off into the clouds. Fade to white.)

第九回
御水天书

你就不能消停会儿吗？
怕我们撞到什么，你飞不就得了
没事瞎愁什么呀？
罗库大师，我得在下个夏末前掌握四种元素
让我算算，你花了年终于精通了御气术
你在下个夏末一定不成问题（风凉话说得真好听）
我连御水术还没学会呢，
到北极也还得几个星期，我该咋办啊？
别紧张，一切都会顺利的
不嫌弃的话，我可以教你几招我会的招式
-真的吗？ -我们先得找个有水的地方来练功
没准老天开眼，还奖励个桨让你玩水呢
老天还真给面子~
伙计，别不等我自己玩儿啊~
别忘了我们此行的目的
抱歉，是时候该练习御水术了
那我该干点什么呢？
你可以帮忙给 阿柏 做做足底保健
什么？你们可以在水里嬉戏，
我却要辛辛苦苦给野牛挖脚泥？
里面的小虫子也别放过啊
好啦~
是谁在改变我们的航线
想造反啊，谁让你更改航线的
是我让他做的
祖寇 殿下，现在有件十万火急的事要做
是和降世神通有关吗？
比那还要重要，好像...好像
我弄丢了我的 莲花棋子
“莲花棋子”？啥东西？
它是棋类游戏中重要的一颗棋子，
很多人认为“莲花棋子”无足轻重，
其实只要适当的运用战略，小兵也能立大功
你就为了个“莲花棋子”更改了我们的航线？
看来你和其他人一样低估了它的价值
就给我十分钟，去港口的商店里转转，
希望他们那里有现货
没有它可让我怎么活啊
我真幸运有这么一个善解人意的侄子。
你可别太得意了，一会换过来你给我服务
首先交给你一个基础动作，
不过我可是花了几个月才学会的
所以如果做不好的话，也不要太灰心
像我这样“一推一拉”
这个招式的关键是腕部动作要到位
你说是像这样吗？
差不多就是这样，如果你继续练习的话，
我相信你...一定...
看哪，这招我学会了
哇，真没想到你这么快就学会了
我可是学了足足有个月
你可是自己钻研的，而我却有个好老师教我，
当然不一样了
谢啦~
-那我们下面该学习什么了？
-下面学点难点的，我叫它“行云流水”
这招没有看起来那么简单，
所以不要因为做不好就太...失望
这个，不错，不过那个举水过顶的动作有点多余
知道了，不过别听下来啊，再教我点别的
还有一招，这招很难，我还没有完全精通它
这招是要使水形成滔天大浪，我叫它“排山倒海”
你是说像这样吗？
安昂？？
我想这招我也学会了，呵呵
再教我点别的吧
今天的训练到此结束
得瑟吧，把咱们的口粮都冲走了
抱歉了，没事，肯定还能找到其他吃的
还让不让人活啊，又让他学会御水术
快放我下来啊！
想知道这袋子里装的是什么吗？谁有勇气过来看看
布米城主给我们的钱现在只剩下个铜板了
-我们现在不能随便乱花钱了
-索卡，更正一下，现在只剩下块了
这哨子让我无法抗拒
烂哨子，根本就吹不响
看吧，模模都觉得这哨子是个破烂
无意冒犯，安昂，钱以后还是我来拿吧
各国珍宝，无所不有，只要有诚心，任你砍价
大家都来看啊，大家都来买啊！
嘿，几位客官，看你们风尘仆仆的，
肯定是在环游旅行呢吧
过来看看吧，异国风情的古玩怎么样，
够吸引人吧？
好的，我想看看，都有啥好东东？
我一时也想不起来，进来看看不就得了吗
我从来都没看过品种如此特别的猿猴，
肯定能给我赚大钱，这位客官，
把它卖给我怎么样？价格好商量
我可不会卖掉 模模
快过来看看啊，安昂，这是一个御水术的武功卷轴
这些招式真是棒透了
这个御水神功你是从哪得到的？
从北边得来的，收购的价格
相当公道，就相当于没花钱
等等，拥有一大堆来路不明的财宝
航海爱好者，还有个破鸟作宠物
你们是海盗
我们更喜欢别人叫我们“高风险商人”
那么，给个价吧，这个交易来的卷轴到底多少钱
本来已经定给了一位土国贵族，
不过你们要是现在给我黄金的话就卖给你们
我知道怎么对付他，海盗都喜欢砍价
好好学学吧
-这个...一个铜板怎么样？成交吧？
-哈哈哈，个金币，不二价
我这儿可不时兴讨价还价
算你厉害, 你就两个铜板怎么样？
小子，没钱别在这儿跟我耍贫
安昂, 咱们赶紧走吧，这儿气氛有点不对
好吧，大爷我不要了
你怎么了，卡塔拉
我正想在他们那里淘淘，看看有没有“飞去来去”
那个地方让我发毛，感觉还是出来得好
你们，给我回来
看看，反悔了吧。我就说过他们好砍价嘛
-收拾他们。-谁也别想跑。
看样子，这些海盗可不是来和我们砍价的
给我站住！
咱们从这儿走，堵住他们！
我的卷心菜啊！
（悲惨的卷心菜大叔又登场了）
这地方比 奥玛舒 还烂
希望那个猴子够珍贵，可以卖个好价钱
-现在谁来跟我过过招啊
-抱歉，没空奉陪
-都过来抓紧了
-安昂，飞错方向了，咋冲着海盗飞呢
抓紧就是了
以前我也见过海盗，可没见过这么凶的
可不是嘛，所以我拿了这个
-不是吧
-安昂，是不是很棒
难怪他们要来追我们，原来你顺了他们的御水天书
什么“顺”，多难听，应该叫“高风险交易”
说的好，卡塔拉
索卡，他们可不是通过正当途径得来，
肯定是从御水师那里偷得来的
这我知道，我生气是因为你就
为了练些玩水的新把戏，
而拿我们大家的生命开玩笑
这上面记载的是真正的御水术，对安昂来说至关重要
随便你了
既然木已成舟
现在天书是我们的了，我们该着手练习了
这的商店我都走遍了
居然没有一家店能买到我要的棋子
那可真要谢谢你了，耽误了所有人的宝贵时间
恰恰相反，正如我以前说的：
比寻找想要的东西更棒的是...
淘到一些原本不期待的便宜的东西
-你居然买了个号
-船上没音乐总觉得少点什么
改天应该看看买点木管乐器
这家没准有我想要的东西
哦哟，太帅了
放在咱们军舰上肯定棒透了
我们没能抓住水宗女孩，还有跟着他的那个小秃头
那个小秃头头顶是不是有个箭头符号？
先让我学这个招式，你可以先学其他的
来，帮我举一下
“水单鞭”，这招应该很实用
就那么好笑吗？
抱歉，不过你也是活该。
安昂你被糊弄了，她只顾自己学
等我学会了这招，就该轮到 安昂 学了
哼，我咋就学不会这破招呢
放心，你能学会的
你只要调整好重心，看吧，这招的关键就在于.....
闭嘴吧！你那些不知所谓的小聪明真让人受不了
你就不能不在我面前卖弄你所谓的天赋？
咋的？
哦，天啊，安昂。我很抱歉
我是一时头脑发热，我保证不会再那样了
天书现在交给你吧
我不想再因为它发脾气了
-没关系的，卡塔拉
-模模招你惹你了，它可是真正的受害者
-真对不起，模模
-那我呢？你经常...
别跟着瞎起哄
森林里不用搜搜吗？
-用不着，你不是说御水天书在他们手上吗？
-没错
那他们一定是在水边上
嘘~模模，听话，快回去睡觉
嘘~
真烂，拜托啊水，配合一下
好的，我是不是应该...
烂天书~
好了，卡塔拉，根据姿势调整一下重心
起开，放开我
我会在海盗面前给你说说情的
如果告诉我他在哪儿，我就放你和你哥哥一马
-你别做梦了
-你要知道，我得找回我失去的东西
找回我的尊严，这样吧，让我们做个交换怎么样？
我妈妈的项链
你怎么得到的？
实话告诉你，这可不是我偷来的，
告诉我他在哪？
-没门
-别扯什么破项链了
你答应把天书还给我们
-想必这天书一定挺贵吧
-不要啊
看来是了，找到我想要的，就把天书还给你们，
这样大家都高兴
-去树林里把那个男孩找出来
-算你恨！
她跑到哪去了？真难以置信
怎么了？
她把天书拿走了，那玩艺让她难堪了，迟早...
抓到他了，咱们走
不是吧，我就没有被绑架的价值吗？
做的不错
-安昂，这都是我的错
-不对，不是你的错
这件事，她是要负点责任
-把那个男孩交给我
-你先把天书给我再说
你们真的想拿降世神通换个破卷轴？
别听他的，他想挑拨离间
-你的朋友是降世神通
-那可不，相信他在黑市上卖的钱
可比那个破卷轴值钱多了
闭嘴，你这个水族乡巴佬
可不是嘛，别说了，索卡
只是想让你们知道，这笔交易不划算，
把降世神通交给烈火王，赏银肯定够你们花一辈子的
天书你留着吧，赏金够我们买几百个的
竟敢取消交易，你会后悔的
多谢了，模模，回头给你弄一车苹果吃
安昂，你在哪儿？
我在这儿，顺着我的声音找
哪儿？我找不到你
我就在这儿
算了，还是我去找你吧
快跑~
-卡塔拉，你还好吗？
-过来帮我把船推到水里，咱们好逃跑
-咱们要是有钱就好了，可以雇些小鬼来推船
-雇些小鬼？
其实有两个御水师就行
大家快上船
-还在这儿打呢，没看到自己的船都被别人开走了
-皇叔，别乌鸦嘴
不是瞎说的，是真的
妈呀，我的“血钻猪猴”还在上面呢
嘿，那是我的船
-看来今天是有点乌鸦嘴
-皇叔，快走！
索卡，开的再快点成吗
这船和我们水部落的不一样
-嘿，你学会了“水单鞭”
-多亏了你的帮忙
能救完我之后再互相道贺吗？
打得好！
安昂，快看啊！
天啊，不是吧
你傻了吗？现在可不是学吹哨的时候
安昂，我们可以将船停住，来，咱们一起用御水术
看来管用了，速度减慢了
-咱们做到了
-不过，又有了个新麻烦
快跳！
我就知道这个野牛哨能派上用场，多谢了，阿柏
是啊，谢了
我的船啊~
祖寇殿下，你肯定不会相信的
我要找的“莲花棋子”一直就在我的袖管里
安昂，我想我应该向你道歉，
你不费力就能用好御水术
我太争强好胜了，给大家带来了麻烦
-我很抱歉
-没关系的，卡塔拉
再也不想看到那个破天书了
-你真的这么想吗？
-天书卷轴？
-从今天的事，你学到了什么？
-偷盗是不对的
但是偷海盗的东西就另当别论了
说的是啊，卡塔拉

水善国
土强国
火烈国
气和国
很久以前，这四大国和谐共处
然而，烈火国发起的战争结束了和平
只有同时掌握四种元素的将世神通才能结束战争
然而在大家最需要他的时候，他却消失了
年后，我和哥哥发现了新的降世神通，
他是个御气师，名叫“安昂”
尽管他的御气术着实厉害
在拯救苍生之前，他要学的还有很多
但是我坚信 安昂 能拯救这个世界
