      Scene I

      (Wide shot of the open sky over a lush river valley. It is a beautiful day
      with lazy, puffy white clouds and sunshine. Cut to an overhead view of the
      valley floor, clouds moving below. A red bird moves into view, soon
      engulfed in an Appa shaped shadow. Cut to a long shot of Appa moving
      slowly through the clouds, replaced quickly by a pan left showing Aang in
      Appa&#x27;s driving seat, leaning back, enjoying himself with a reed in his
      mouth. As the camera pans left, Katara stretches out on her stomach
      looking over Appa&#x27;s side, while Sokka whittles.)

      Katara (from o.c. at first): Those clouds look so soft, don&#x27;t they? Like
      you could just jump down and you&#x27;d land in a big, soft cottony heap.
      Sokka: Maybe you should give it a try.
      Katara: You&#x27;re hilarious.

      (Cut to Aang, whose head pops towards the camera, almost smashing into it,
      a wide grin on his face.)

      Aang: I&#x27;ll try it! Yehhhh!

      (He jumps right off Appa&#x27;s side, laughing and hurtling down through the
      clouds with his staff. Sokka and Katara look over the side of Appa as he
      plunges through a cloud. A moment later Aang lands next to them with his
      glider. He is soaking wet.)

      Aang: Turns out clouds are made of water!

      (He airbends himself dry. Sokka and Katara eye him strangely. Suddenly,
      Katara turns and looks ahead.)

      Katara: Hey, what is that?

      (Cut to a forward view. Up ahead, the floor of the valley below around the
      river is black instead of vegetation green.)

      Sokka: It&#x27;s like a scar.

      (Cut to a scene on the floor of the valley in the damaged area. Burnt tree
      stumps dot the barren landscape. The three have dismounted Appa and are
      walking around. Aang is in the foreground, Katara on his left back near
      Appa and Sokka to his right.)

      Sokka: Listen, it&#x27;s so quiet. There&#x27;s no life anywhere.
      Katara: Aang, are you ok?

      (Cut to a view of footprints on the burnt ground. Sokka is examining
them.)

      Sokka: Fire Nation! Those evil savages make me sick! They have no respect
      for �
      Katara: Shh!
      Sokka (whispering): What? I&#x27;m not allowed to be angry?

      (Katara points ahead. Cut to Aang, standing ahead, clearly upset. He sinks
      to his knees in the dust and sighs. Cut to a frontal shot of Aang, who
      begins to run his hands through the burnt earth.)

      Aang: Why would anyone do this? How could I let this happen?
      Katara: Aang, you didn&#x27;t let this happen. It has nothing to do with you.
      Aang: Yes it does. It&#x27;s the Avatar&#x27;s job to protect nature. But, I don&#x27;t
      know how to do my job.
      Katara: That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re going to the North Pole to find you a teacher.
      Aang: Yeh, a waterbending teacher, but there&#x27;s no one who can teach me how
      to be the Avatar. Monk Gyatso said that Avatar Roku would help me.
      Sokka: The Avatar before you? He died over a hundred years ago, how are
      you supposed to talk to him?
      Aang: I don&#x27;t know.

      (Momo jumps into his lap and begins to chitter. Aang pets his back. Fade
      to a scene of Prince Zuko emerging from tall reads into a clearing.)

      Zuko (yelling): Uncle! It&#x27;s time to leave! Where are you? Uncle Iroh!

      (The camera pans left to follow Zuko. A fire soldier uniform becomes
      visible hanging from the low branches of a tree as the screen pans. Cut to
      Iroh in a hot bath, the tub made out of rock and it is fed by a stream
      coming out of the rocks behind it.)

      Iroh (happily)&gt;: Over here.
      Zuko: Uncle? We need to move on, we&#x27;re closing in on the Avatar&#x27;s trail
      and I don&#x27;t want to lose him!
      Iroh: You look tired, Prince Zuko. Why don&#x27;t you join me in these hot
      springs and soak away your troubles.
      Zuko (angry): My troubles cannot be soaked away. It&#x27;s time to go!
      Iroh: You should take your teacher&#x27;s advice and relax a little. The
      temperature&#x27;s just right. I heated it myself.

      (Iroh shifts position slightly, puts his hands together and breathes steam
      from his nostrils. Cut to Zuko, obscured by steam, who swats it away.)

      Zuko: Enough! We need to leave now! Get out of the water!
      Iroh (rising): Very well.

      (Cut to view from behind Zuko, where Zuko has put his hand up to
      strategically block the view of Iroh. Cut to view from Iroh&#x27;s p.o.v.)

      Zuko: On second thought, why don&#x27;t you take another few minutes, but be
      back at the ship in half an hour or I&#x27;m leaving without you.
      Iroh (leaning back, happily): Ahhhh!

      (Cut back to an overhead shot of Aang still kneeling in the wasteland.
      Katara approaches him from behind.)

      Katara: Hey Aang, are you ready to be cheered up?
      Aang: No.

      (An acorn flys by from o.c., hitting Aang on the side of the head.)

      Aang: Ow!

      (Cut to a wider shot of Aang looking at Katara, now in the foreground
      bouncing another acorn up and down in her right hand.)

      Aang: Hey, how was that cheering me up?
      Sokka: Hehe, cheered me up.

      (Cut to Sokka, who promptly gets whacked by an acorn from Katara on this
      side of his head.)

      Sokka: Ow! Yeh, I probably deserved that.
      Katara: These acorns are everywhere, Aang. That means the forest will grow
      back. Every one of these will be a tall oak tree someday, and all the
      birds and animals that lived here will come back.

      (In the background Momo digs furiously in the scorched earth, emerging
      with a double handful of acorns. Katara places an acorn in the palm of
      Aang&#x27;s hands and closes it.)

      Aang (smiling): Thanks, Katara.

      (Katara smiles and then makes a startled sound, looking o.c. Cut to a shot
      of an old man in green using a walking stick approaching the group, then
      cut back to the group as the old man enters the screen from the right and
      walks up to Aang.)

      Sokka: Hey, who are you?
      Old Man: When I saw the flying bison, I thought it was impossible, but
      those markings� are you the Avatar child?

      (Aang turns to Katara, who nods her head. He turns back to the old man and
      nods his head in turn.)

      Old Man: My village desperately needs your help.

      (Cut to a late afternoon shot of the sun about to go down beneath hills in
      the distance. The bottom of the screen shows the upper part of the walls
      of an Earth Kingdom village. Cut to an overhead shot of the group
      following the old man into the village. Much of it has been burned out and
      destroyed. Sad music plays. They enter one of the buildings where some
      villagers are gathered. As the Old Man introduces Aang to the people, a
      man, probably the village chief walks over.)

      Old Man: This young person is the Avatar.
      Chief: So the rumors of your return are true. (He bows.) It is the
      greatest honor of a lifetime to be in your presence.
      Aang (bows): Nice to meet you too. (Pause). So�is there something I can
      help you with?
      Chief (looking o.c. with a pained expression): I&#x27;m not sure�
      Old Man: Our village is in crisis, he&#x27;s our only hope. For the last few
      days at sunset a spirit monster comes and attacks our village. He is
      Hei-Bai, the black and white spirit.
      Sokka: Why is it attacking you?
      Chief (moving to the threshold of the doorway that the group just entered,
      looking at the setting sun): We do not know, but each of the last three
      nights he has abducted one of our own. We are especially fearful because
      the winter solstice draws near.
      Katara: What happens then?
      Old Man: As the solstice approaches, the natural world and the spirit
      world grow closer and closer until the line between them is blurred
      completely.
      Chief: Hei-Bai is already causing devastation and destruction. Once the
      solstice is here there is no telling what will happen.
      Aang: So, what do you want me to do exactly?
      Old Man: Who better to resolve a crisis between our world and the spirit
      world than the Avatar himself? You are the great bridge between man and
      spirits.
      Aang (clearly lacking confidence): Right�that&#x27;s me.
      Katara: Hey, �great bridge guy&#x27;, can I talk to you over here for a second?

      (Katara walks over to a nearby window. Aang and then a bit later Sokka
      enter screen from the right. They can now talk privately.)

      Katara: Aang, you seem a little unsure about all this.
      Aang: Yeh, that might be because I don&#x27;t know anything at all about the
      spirit world. (Exasperated) It&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s someone to teach me this
      stuff!
      Katara: So, can you help these people?
      Aang: I have to try, don&#x27;t I? Maybe whatever I have to do will just� come
      to me.

      (Momo jumps onto Aang&#x27;s shoulder and chitters. Aang is surprised, but then
      smiles. Cut to Katara, the open window behind her, smiling serenely.)

      Katara: I think you can do it, Aang.

      (Camera pans right from Katara to Sokka, who is also looking at Aang,
      smiling serenely.)

      Sokka: Yehhh, we&#x27;re all gonna get eaten by a spirit monster.

      (Fade back to Iroh soaking in his outdoor hot spring bath. An overhead
      that is slowly zooming in is quickly replaced by a close up of Iroh
      snoring peacefully in the bath. A noise startles Iroh into wakefulness.)

      Iroh: Uh? Who&#x27;s there?

      (Switch to Iroh&#x27;s p.o.v., his head clearly scanning back and forth over
      the forest in front of him. A small rodent jumps onto the lip of the bath.
      He lets it jumps onto his outstretched hand.)

      Iroh: A meadow vole! I should have known. You startled me, little one.
      (Lets vole go and leans back in the bath and puts his hands behind his
      head.) Ehh, seems I&#x27;ve dozed off and missed my nephew&#x27;s deadline, but it
      was a very sweet nap.

      (The vole starts hopping up and down on the lip of the bath and making
      chittering noises. Suddenly it stops, the ground starts shaking from
      deeper in the forest. It flips around to see dust clouds rising from the
      forest and then hops away. Switch to a panning shot from the forest&#x27;s
      p.o.v. The camera pans up as the ground disturbance or tremor moves. Soon
      it reaches Iroh&#x27;s bath and we see that two other shock waves have
      approached the bath from Iroh&#x27;s left and right. The old general has been
      caught by surprise and when the shockwaves reach his tub he is quickly
      held fast by three triangular stones that have been pushed into the tub. A
      second later, three earthbenders appear next to the tub behind each of the
      three stone projectiles that are holding Iroh imprisoned. Cut to an Earth
      Kingdom soldier taking Iroh&#x27;s uniform off the tree, screen pans right to
      show an officer walking up to the bath.)

      Soldier: He&#x27;s a Fire Nation soldier.
      Captain: He&#x27;s no ordinary soldier. This is the Fire Lord&#x27;s brother, the
      Dragon of the West, the once great General Iroh, but now, he&#x27;s our
      prisoner.

      (Cut back to Iroh, squinting unhappily at his ignominious capture. Cut to
      an overhead shot of the forest outside of the Earth Kingdom village. The
      sun has nearly set. The screen pans down and fades to Aang exiting the
      meetinghouse building where he had met the chief. The doors close behind
      him. Aang begins to walk through the village, hands defensively wrapped
      around his staff.)

      Aang: Hello? Spirit, can you hear me? This is the Avatar speaking. I&#x27;m�
      here to try to help stuff.

      (Cut to a view of Aang about to exit the village gate. The shot zooms out
      to show Sokka and Katara, backs to the audience, watching Aang from the
      window of the meeting house. The sun has almost set.)

      Sokka: This isn&#x27;t right. We can&#x27;t sit here and cower while Aang waits for
      some monster to show up.

      (Cut to a frontal view of the window. The old man stands behind the
      siblings. Part way through the ensuing conversation, switch to a side
      view, showing that much of the village waits in fear in the meetinghouse
      with the Old Man, Katara and Sokka.)

      Old Man: If anyone can save us, he can.
      Sokka: He still shouldn&#x27;t have to face this alone.

      (Outside, the sun sets. The world darkens. Cut to Aang, standing at the
      village gate, like a gunslinger.)

      Aang (shouting): The sun has set. Where are you, Hei-Bai? Well, spirit,
      uh, I hereby ask you to please leave this village in peace!

      (He twirls his staff like a marching baton and then plants it in the
      ground like a flag. His expression is resolute. Cut to a longshot view
      from behind of Aang standing at the gate.)

      Aang: Okay. Well, I guess that&#x27;s settled then.

      (Aang turns and begins to walk back to the village. Cut to a shot of Aang
      from behind, who quickly turns to exit the screen to the right, leaving a
      view of the dark woods. Spirit whispers begin to be heard. Suddenly a
      massive shape emerges from the forest, its huge feet making large thudding
      sounds each time they hit the ground. Cut to commercial break.)

      Scene II

      (When the show returns, Aang is still walking placidly up the village
      street, unaware that Hei-Bai is following right behind him. Hei-Bai is as
      big as a house, with six legs and black and white orca-like markings all
      over his body. He is vaguely mammalian and has razor sharp teeth. Aang
      realizes something is amiss and stops. He turns, looks up at the monster,
      and smiles.)

      Aang: You must be the Hei-Bai spirit. (He bows his head.) My name is�

      (He is cut off by a blast of air and blue energy from the mouth of the
      creature, Aang does not move but his staff is blown to the ground. The
      spirit rears itslef itself up on its hind-most legs and bellows, releasing
      another jet of blue energy from its mouth. It gets back on all six legs
      and then charges into the village, ignoring Aang and leaving him behind.
      Aang turns to address the monster as it moves in.)

      Aang: My name is Aang! I&#x27;m the Avatar and I would like to help! Hey, wait
      up!

      (The spirit destroys in rapid succession two houses and a watchtower using
      its brute strength and blue energy. The monster continues to destroy
      building off screen as Aang follows it around trying to get its
attention.)

      Aang: Uh�

      (Cut to a frontal view of the meetinghouse window, where Katara and Sokka
      look out. Sokka looks poised to jump out the window to join the fray. The
      village chief is behind them.)

      Chief: The Avatar&#x27;s methods are� (they duck as flying debris hits the
      window) unusual.
      Sokka: It doesn&#x27;t seem too interested in what he&#x27;s saying. Maybe we should
      go help him?
      Old Man: No, only the Avatar stands a chance against the Hei-Bai.
      Katara: Aang will figure out the right thing to do, Sokka.

      (Momo appears to Sokka&#x27;s right in the window, his eyes blinking widely.
      Cut to a side view shot of a building. Just beyond, a huge pile of debris
      gets blown above the building. Hei-Bai enters from the right as the screen
      pans down to reveal Aang running to the building between he and the
      monster.)

      Aang: Please, would you stop destroying things and listen?

      (He jumps on top of the building between them. He sees Hei-Bai pounding a
      building into the ground with his fists.)

      Aang: I&#x27;m just trying to do my job as spirit bridge. Excuse me, would you
      please turn around? I command you to turn around now!

      (At this the monster does indeed turn around, swatting Aang backward off
      the top of the building. Aang flys through the air and hits a nearby roof.
      He slides off and collapses on the ground. Cut back to the meetinghouse
      window.)

      Sokka: That&#x27;s it! He needs help! (He exits to his left.)
      Katara: Sokka wait!

      (The doors of the meetinghouse open and Sokka runs out. Katara follows,
      but is stopped by the old man.)

      Old Man: It&#x27;s not safe!

      (Cut to the monster standing over Aang in the foreground, while in the
      background we see Sokka, hefting his boomering, having just emerged from
      the meeting house. Cut to close of Sokka, ready to shoot.)

      Sokka: Hei-Bai! Over here!

      (He lets loose the boomerang. Switch to a view of the creature from
      behind. The boomerang rotates into view, hits the creature&#x27;s butt, and
      bounces off with a sound effect indicating its harmless impact. It falls
      on the ground. Cut back to Sokka, who runs up to Aang.)

      Aang: Sokka, go back!
      Sokka: We&#x27;ll fight him together, Aang.
      Aang: I don&#x27;t wanna fight him unless I � huh!

      (Hei-Bai comes on screen in a flash from the left and takes Sokka. Both
      disappear in an instant, cutting Aang off in mid-sentence. Aang opens his
      staff into glider mode and takes off. Cut to the monster loping back into
      the forest, Aang gliding in pursuit. Katara runs into the picture from
      o.c., but stops at the village gate, clearly unable to catch up.)

      Katara: Sokka!

      (Cut to frontal shot of Katara, who looks down in sadness, sympathetic
      villagers coming up behind her. Cut to a shot of Zuko lowering a tree
      branch from eye-level so he can move forward, a Fire Nation soldier behind
      him. He barges into the clearing with the ruined hot tub.)

      Zuko: Uncle! Uncle, where are you?
      Soldier: Sir, maybe he thought you left without him?
      Zuko: Something&#x27;s not right here. (He examines the hot tub, now with the
      stone projectiles embedded in it.) That pile of rocks�
      Soldier: It looks like there&#x27;s been a landslide, sir.
      Zuko: Land doesn&#x27;t slide uphill. Those rocks didn&#x27;t move naturally. My
      uncle&#x27;s been captured by earthbenders!

      (Cut back to Aang gliding at breakneck speed through the forest in pursuit
      of Hei-Bai, then to Sokka in the grip of the monster, making scared
      noises. Cut to a side view of the monster where it is clear that Aang has
      pulled even with it and is beginning to pass, but he hits a branch and
      slows down.)

      Sokka: Aang, over here!

      (Cut to an overhead shot where Aang is playing catch up again. Hei Bai
      enters the wasteland from the beginning of the episode, Aang close behind.
      Switch to a close up of Sokka in the grip of the monster.)

      Sokka: Help!
      Aang: Hang on, Sokka!

      (Aang glides in closer, stretching his hand to Sokka, who is able to grab
      it. Just as Aang begins to pull Sokka free, however, both he and the
      monster vanish. Aang falls out of the sky in surprise. Cut to Aang laid
      out at the base of the stone statue of a bear. Fade to black. The scene
      returns with Aang sitting up, with a crescent moon overhead. Aang seems
      bathed in moonlight.)

      Aang: Sokka! (He looks around and the view zooms out a bit.) I failed.

      (Fade to another night scene of treetops. The screen pans down and then a
      cut to soldiers on war ostriches, a lantern hanging off the point
      soldier&#x27;s mount. The screen pans left to show four mounts total, one of
      them bearing a basically naked and chained General Iroh.)

      Iroh: Where are you taking me?
      Captain: We&#x27;re taking you to face justice.
      Iroh: Right. But where, specifically?
      Captain: A place you&#x27;re quite familiar with, actually. You once laid siege
      to it for 600 days, but it would not yield to you.
      Iroh (whistfully): Ah! The great city of Ba-Sing-Se.
      Captain: It was greater than you were, apparently.
      Iroh (defensively): I acknowledged my defeat at Ba-Sing-Se! After 600 days
      away from home, my men were tired and I was tired, (yawns, puts face in
      the back of the soldier he is riding with) and I&#x27;m still tired.

      (Iroh falls off the ostrich and the soldier stops to look. Cut to Iroh
      lying on the road, chained up tight, but a smile on his face. The put a
      light on him and pick him up. After they exit the screen, the camera pans
      down and zooms to show the sandal that Iroh has left behind. Cut back to
      Iroh, who smiles. Shift to view to Katara sitting at the village gate,
      looking into the forest. The old man comes up behind her while the noises
      of the night fill the air.)

      Old Man: I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be back.
      Katara: I know.
      Old Man (putting a cover over Katara&#x27;s back): You should get some rest.
      Katara (holding Sokka&#x27;s boomerang and trying to sound hopeful):
      Everything&#x27;s gonna be okay.
      Old Man: Your brother is in good hands. I would be shocked if the Avatar
      returned without him.

      (In the midst of the Old Man&#x27;s comforting words, Aang appears along the
      forest trail leading up to the gate. In this light it is clear now that he
      is not just illuminated by the moon. He is in fact colored a light blue,
      as if he is glowing slightly in some surreal fashion. In the foreground we
      can see Katara&#x27;s downcast face on the left of the screen as Aang begins to
      speak.)

      Aang: Katara, Katara I lost him.

      (Neither she nor the old man react to Aang&#x27;s voice. As Aang comes closer,
      the sun rises behind her and the old man.)

      Old Man: The sun is rising. Perhaps he will return soon.
      Aang: What? No, I&#x27;m right here! Grrr!!!

      (He puts his hands in front of the old man&#x27;s face, but to no effect. Cut
      to Aang&#x27;s p.o.v., with the rising disk of the sun in front of him. He
      looks at his hands glowing blue. Switch to a frontal view of Aang which
      zooms up to his face.)

      Aang: I&#x27;m in the spirit world!

      (Fade to white. Scene returns to a daytime shot of the sandal that Iroh
      left behind. Zuko picks up the sandal and sniffs it, a look of disgust
      spreading over his face.)

      Zuko: Yup, that&#x27;s Uncle Iroh.

      (Cut to wide shot of Zuko standing next to his war rhinoceros, the cut to
      Katara standing dejectedly next to the gate post. The shot widens to show
      Aang sitting next to her.)

      Aang (smiling): I&#x27;ll figure this out, Katara, I promise. Like they said,
      I&#x27;m the bridge between the worlds, right? All I have to do is� figure out
      what I have to do. But once I do that, no problem!

      (Aang looks to his right, then cut to Appa moving along the outside of the
      wall towards Katara and Aang. He grunts and puts his nose up to her.)

      Aang: Appa! Hey buddy, I&#x27;m right here. But, I guess you can&#x27;t see me
      either.

      (Appa keeps grunting at her until she looks up at him.)

      Katara: It&#x27;s ok, Appa. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re on their way back. I bet they even
      found you a bunch of moon peaches for a treat.

      (She walks back into the village, Appa in tow. Cut to a frontal shot of
      Aang turning to look back down the forest path.)

      Aang: What am I supposed to do?

      (The shot expands to show much of the forest.)

      Aang (shouting): Avatar Roku, how can I talk to you?

      (He gets no response at first and looks down in despair. Then, he notices
      something and looks back down the path, his face showing elation.)

      Aang: Sokka?

      (A light shines from down the path. The camera zooms up to it to reveal a
      blue spirit dragon flying toward him. Cut back to Aang who sees this with
      alarm.)

      Aang: That&#x27;s definitely not Sokka!

      (He opens his glider and takes flight back into the village, but he hits
      the ground again a few feet away. He gets up and tries to airbend the
      glider off the ground, but nothing happens. Aang looks down at his hands
      in disbelief.)

      Aang: What? I can&#x27;t airbend in the spirit world!

      (Cut to the blue spirit dragon bearing down on Aang, then cut to
      commercial break.)

      Scene III

      (When the show returns we once again see the blue dragon, wreathed in
      radioactive blue fire, bearing down on Aang. Cut to the clearing in front
      of the gate where Aang stands. Suddenly the dragon is upon him and Aang
      cowers beneath it, fear framing his young face.)

      Aang: You don&#x27;t know where Sokka is, do you?

      (In response, the dragon bends its head down and touches Aang&#x27;s head with
      one of its whiskers. Aang&#x27;s eyes glow with a blue fire when touched. A
      flashback begins of an old man riding the dragon the way Aang rides Appa.
      They approach the camera; in life the dragon was red and brown. The
      flashback ends as the blue dragon breaks its touch.)

      Aang: You&#x27;re Avatar Roku&#x27;s animal guide! Like Appa is to me. I need to
      save my friend and I don&#x27;t know how. Is there some way for me to talk to
      Roku?

      (The dragon bends its neck and Aang jumps on.)

      Aang: I&#x27;ll be back Katara. (To the dragon) Take me to Roku!

      (Aang and the dragon take off. Cut to Katara stroking Appa sadly, with
      Aang and the dragon visible of her left shoulder as they depart. Fade to
      an overhead shot of a winding mountain path. The four war ostriches plod
      along it. Cut to Iroh and his captor. He looks up and is startled to see
      the blue dragon and Aang whiz by overhead. They pass right over the heads
      of the procession, but it is clear that only Iroh has seen anything.)

      Captain: What&#x27;s the problem?
      Iroh: Nothing. Actually, there is a bit of a problem. My old joints are
      feeling sore and achy and these shackles are too loose.
      Captain: Too loose?
      Iroh: That&#x27;s right. The cuffs are loose and they jangle around and bump my
      wrists. It would help me if you would tighten them so they wouldn&#x27;t shake
      around so much.
      Captain: Very well. Corporal, tighten the prisoner&#x27;s hand cuffs.

      (Cut to a shot of the sky over the path which pans down to reveal the
      ostriches parked on the ground. The corporal gets off and he touches
      Iroh&#x27;s handcuffs, Iroh breathes on them. They become red hot and Iroh
      grabs the corporal&#x27;s hand and puts them on the hot iron. The corporal
      screams in pain and Iroh hops off the ostrich. He launches himself into
      the air and fires a blast of flame from his feet at the other soldier&#x27;s on
      their ostriches. He rolls off the path and down the hill during the
      ensuing uproar. Cut to a view from Aang&#x27;s p.o.v. on the dragon as they
      swiftly approach a volcanic island. It has a beautiful Fire Temple on it,
      which they enter and fly straight towards the ceiling.)

      Aang: Hey, what are you doing!? Ahhhh!!!

      (They rapidly approach the ceiling, which they pass through harmlessly.
      The dragon alights on the floor of a secret chamber at the top of the
      temple. It is empty except for the statue of an old man in the background.
      Aang dismounts and walks toward the statue.)

      Aang: I don&#x27;t understand. This is just a statue of Roku.

      (Aang looks back at the dragon, which touches him on the temple once
      again. Aang&#x27;s eyes light up blue, and this time the vision is of a huge,
      flaming comet rocketing through the sky. The vision ends as the dragon
      breaks contact.)

      Aang: Is that what Roku wants to talk to me about? A comet? When can I
      talk to him?

      (The dragon lowers its head in response. Cut to a wider shot where it now
      revealed that the sun shines through a tiny window high up in the ceiling.
      The shaft of light, previously blocked by the dragon, now hits the wall
      near Roku&#x27;s right shoulder. The dragon touches Aang again and a vision of
      time passing at the Fire Temple begins. Cut to an exterior shot of the
      temple sitting on its volcanic promontory. Clouds fly by at incredible
      speed overhead and the sun rounds its daily course in a matter of seconds.
      Three days pass in this fashion before a fade to show the floor of the
      statue&#x27;s chamber. Two Asian written characters are shown before cutting to
      a shot of the little window where the sunlight enters. Days pass in rapid
      succession there as well. Shift to a long shot of the statue from the back
      of the room, where it is clear with each day the spot where the shaft of
      sunlight hits the back wall gets closer to hitting the statue&#x27;s face as
      each day passes. The vision ends.)

      Aang: It&#x27;s a calendar, and the light will reach Roku on the solstice!
      (Turning to dragon) So, that&#x27;s when I&#x27;ll be able to speak to Roku? (The
      dragon grunts.) But I can&#x27;t wait that long. I need to save Sokka now.

      (Cut to a long, overhead shot of Aang and the dragon departing the
      volcanic and terrific speed, then cut to Iroh rolling down the hillside,
      still chained. The earthebender soldiers watch him from over the lip,
      earthbend a torrent of dirt and rock after him and then slide down the
      hillside in pursuit. When they catch up to him, Iroh is almost buried.)

      Soldier: He is too dangerous, Captain. We can&#x27;t just carry him to the
      capital. We have to do something now.
      Captain: I agree. He must be dealt with immediately and severely.

      (Cut to a close up of Iroh&#x27;s face. He spits out a stone and looks with
      disdain upon his captors. Cut to Appa and Katara flying reconnaissance
      over the forest.)

      Katara: It&#x27;s no use, Appa. I don&#x27;t see them anywhere. Our best hope is to
      go back to the village and wait.

      (Cut to wide shot as she turns Appa to fly back to the village. Shift to a
      huge reptilian foot slamming into the ground where a clear trail of the
      war ostriches can be seen. Cut to Zuko atop his war rhinoceros, who looks
      over his shoulder to see Appa flying in the distance.)

      Zuko: The Avatar!

      (He yanks the reigns to turn the beast back, but then he looks down the
      trail that leads to his captured uncle. He looks back again in the
      direction he saw Appa, indecision marking his face. Cut to Aang and the
      dragon flying through the wasteland at the edge of the forest. Up ahead
      the bear stature can be seen, rapidly growing larger. His body sits
      crossed legged atop it. Aang braces himself for impact, but he rejoins his
      own body as the dragon disappears into the statue. He wakes up, now back
      in the material world. He jumps down off the statue and turns to stare in
      wonder at it. After a close up of the face of the bear statue, Aang opens
      his glider and flies back toward the village. Cut to a view of the setting
      sun from the village where Katara looks downcast. She is standing on the
      porch of the meetinghouse. Out of the sunset Aang comes into view and
      lands near her. She rushes to hug him and Momo flies to perch on his
      master&#x27;s shoulder.)

      Katara: You&#x27;re back! Where&#x27;s Sokka?
      Aang (downcast): I&#x27;m not sure.

      (The sun sets and both look over their shoulders to the forest. Fade to
      Iroh and his captors in an earthen pit. Iroh is stretched over a large
      rock in the center of the pit, his hands spread before him.)

      Captain: These dangerous hands must be crushed.

      (The captain cries aloud as he raises a huge boulder from the ground and
      moves it to hover over Iroh&#x27;s hands. He drops it. A moment before it
      crushed Iroh&#x27;s hands and arms, Zuko enters the screen from the left and
      kicks it out of the way. He lands and breaks the chains holding Iroh&#x27;s
      hands bound with a kick. Iroh rises with a smile.)

      Iroh: Excellent form, Prince Zuko.
      Zuko: You taught me well.
      Captain: Surrender yourselves, it&#x27;s five against two. You&#x27;re clearly
      outnumbered.

      (Cut to Iroh and Zuko, back to back, surrounded by their would be
captors.)

      Iroh: Uh, that&#x27;s true, but you are clearly outmatched!

      (All five earthbenders launch stones at the pair. Iroh swings his chains
      and breaks them into pieces mid-flight, while Zuko blasts the two nearest
      him with fire. Cut to a frontal view of Zuko where it is clear that the
      two soldiers behind him have just shot two large rocks at him. Zuko is
      about to be hit when the stones are wrapped in Iroh&#x27;s chains. He swings
      them around his body and releases them back at their captors. They are hit
      in the stomach and are both knocked out. The Captain launches several
      rocks at Zuko, who dodges them and returns fire. The fire blast is blocked
      when the Captain lowers his head and the fire breaks harmlessly over his
      onion shaped helmet. The Captain raise two huge sheets of rock and Zuko
      looks afraid, but then chains wrap around the Captain&#x27;s feet and his is
      pulled to the ground by Iroh. The rocks land on top of him. Cut to the
      Earth Kingdom soldiers groaning and buried in dirt, Iroh and Zuko standing
      over them. They look at each other and smile, Zuko putting his hand on his
      uncle&#x27;s shoulder. Cut to an overhead shot of the pit.)

      Zuko: Now would you please put on some clothes!

      (Fade to Aang standing at the village gate once again. It is still night.
      Cut to the chief, Momo and Katara looking out of the meetinghouse window
      towards Aang, then cut to Aang standing at the gate again, the wind
      blowing dead leaves past him. Some time has evidently passed, and Aang&#x27;s
      begins to walk back into the village. As he approaches a building with a
      wind chime that is sounding in the wind, the monster appears. Cut to the
      monster breaking through the roof of the building with the wind chime. It
      roars in triumph, releasing blue energy from its mouth. Cut to Aang who
      cries out and begins to make an energy shell similar to the one he created
      in �The Southern Air Temple.� Cut to Katara looking out the window.)

      Katara: Aang, what are you doing? Run!

      (The creature roars and runs toward another building, but Aang runs
      underneath its legs and then jumps up onto its forehead. His hand glows
      light blue, and Aang sues a panda bear superimposed over the monster. Aang
      jumps back to the porch of a nearby building.)

      Aang: You&#x27;re the spirit of this forest. Now I understand. You&#x27;re upset and
      angry because your home was burned down. When I saw the forest had burned
      I was sad and upset. But my friend gave me hope that the forest would grow
      back.

      (The spirit stands still while Aang speaks. When he is finished, he shows
      Hei-Bai the acorn that Katara gave him. The spirit smiles and Aang places
      the acorn on the porch. The monster picks up the acorn and transforms into
      a panda, who turns and walks away from the village. Cut to Aang standing
      on the porch. The shot widens to show Katara and the other villagers
      coming up behind him. The scene then shifts to the panda exiting the gate.
      Behind him a thicket of bamboo grows to man height in seconds. A moment
      later, Sokka and a few villagers exit the thicket looking confused.)

      Katara: Sokka!

      (She runs to hug him, as other villagers hug their loved ones.)

      Sokka: What happened?
      Katara: You were trapped in the Spirit world for 24 hours. How are you
      feeling?
      Sokka (looking pained): Like I seriously need to use the bathroom!

      (Cut to the chief flanked by two villagers on each side. It is sometime
      later that night.)

      Chief: Thank you, Avatar. If there only were a way to repay you for what
      you&#x27;ve done.
      Sokka: You could give us some supplies and some money.
      Katara (angrily elbowing her brother): Sokka!
      Sokka: What? We need stuff.
      Chief (bowing): It would be an honor to help you prepare for your journey.
      (He exits.)
      Katara: I&#x27;m so proud of you, Aang. You figured out what to do all on your
      own.
      Aang: Actually, I did have a little help. And there&#x27;s something else.

      (Aang looks downcast, cut to a flashback of the comet vision.)

      Sokka: What is it?
      Aang: I need to talk to Roku and I think I&#x27;ve found a way to contact his
      spirit.
      Katara: That&#x27;s great!
      Sokka: Creepy, but great.
      Aang: There&#x27;s a temple on a crescent shaped island, and if I go there on
      the solstice I&#x27;ll be able to speak with him.
      Katara: But, the solstice is tomorrow.
      Aang: Yeh, and there&#x27;s one more problem. The island is in the Fire Nation.

      (Music gets dramatic and cut to the terrified faces of Sokka and Katara.
      Camera pans up to the moon over the hills.)

    第七回
灵界

（冬至，第一部分）
这些云彩看上去软绵绵的，不是吗？
-就像一堆堆柔软的棉花，真想跳上去试试
-不怕死你就试试
真是老粗一个，不懂浪漫
那就让我来试试吧，哈哈...
实践证明于是由水做的
瞧，那是什么？
看起来像条刀疤一样
真静啊！好像周围都没有活的了
安昂，你没事吧？
-又是火国军，这些无耻之徒真让人恶心，他们竟然...
-嘘~
咋的，我难道都不能发发脾气吗？
怎么会有人这么做，我怎么会让这些事发生？
安昂，不是你让这些事发生的，不是你的错
这是我的错，
降世神通的责任就是要保护生灵，
但我却不知道该怎么履行我的责任
所以我们要到北极去嘛，好给你找个老师
那也只是个御水术老师，
现在没人能教我怎样来当个降世神通
雅俗大师说过神通罗库能帮助我
你是指前任神通吗？
他几百年前就去世了，他怎么能帮上忙呢？
我也不知道啊~
皇叔，该走了，你在哪？
艾洛皇叔，你在哪？
这儿呢，这儿呢
皇叔？我们得走了，
降世神通就在附近，可不能让他跑了
祖寇殿下，你太累了，
为何不跟我一起在这温泉里泡泡，去去烦恼
我的烦恼可不会被泡没，赶紧出发吧！
你应该听从老师的教导，学会放松。
啊，这温度刚刚好
再来点蒸汽吧~
够了，够了，我们得现在离开，赶紧从水里出来
-都听你的吧
-我改注意了，你还是再泡会儿吧
不过最多给你半个时辰，你不来战船也不等你了
安昂，准备高兴起来了吗？
还没
你打我，怎么会让我高兴起来
呵呵呵，倒是让我高兴起来了
对不起，我是罪有应得
这种橡果到处都是
这就意味着树林还会重生，
终有一天它们会长成参天大树，
住在这里的动物们也会陆续回来的
多谢你，卡塔拉
-嘿，你是谁？
-当我看到了飞天野牛，
我简直不敢相信自己的眼睛
但是种种迹象证明...难道，孩子，你就是降世神通？
我的村子急需你的帮助
-大家注意了，这位就是降世神通
-那么传说您回来的消息是真的了
-在我有生之年能够见到您是我的荣幸
-见到你很高兴
-那个，有什么我可以帮忙的？
-我也不太清楚
他是解决我们村子危机的唯一的希望了。
在过去的几天里，一到黄昏，
就有个灵兽来袭击我们的村子
-他就是传说中的“黑白“，黑白相间的灵兽
--它为何要袭击你们
我们也不知道，过去的个晚上它都
会抓走一人。我们都十分害怕，因为冬至将至
-那时会怎么样？
-离冬至越近，人间与灵界就越接近，界限越模糊
现在黑白已经这么凶猛，不知冬至时将会厉害成啥样
-那...你们想让我怎样做？
-没有谁比降世神通更能解决人间和
灵界之间的问题了，你就像一条沟通的桥梁
-是啊，那可不呗~
-那个...伟大的“沟通桥梁“，能和你单独谈谈吗？
-安昂, 看起来你对这件事没什么把握嘛
-是啊，我对那个什么灵界完全没有概念
又没人教过我那是个什么东东
-那...你还能帮助这些人们吗？
-我总得试试啊，不是吗？
船到桥头自然直嘛！
-安昂，我相信你能行
-哎，看来我们得被灵兽吃掉了
谁在那儿？原来是个小草鼠啊，
我早该料到的嘛，你可是把我吓到了，不乖不乖
看来我睡过头了，超过了皇侄定的期限，
不过刚才的盹真舒服啊
-他是个火军的士兵
-他可不是不同的士兵，他是火国国王的兄弟
西方之龙，大将军艾洛
可是现在，他是我们的阶下囚
好啊，魂儿~能听见我吗？我是降世神通
-我是来帮忙的
-这样做不对，我们不能像个懦夫一样躲在这里，
而让安昂一个人引灵兽出来
-这里只有他才能拯救整个村子
-那也不能让他独自面对危险啊
太阳都落山了，黑白你在哪儿呢？
那个，魂儿啊，我命令你远离村庄，莫来捣乱
好吧，看来我们达成协议了
你想必就是黑白了，我就是....
我叫安昂，我就是降世神通，是来帮忙的，嘿，等等
-降世神通的方法真特别啊
-好像它对安昂说的不感冒啊，
也许我们应该出去帮帮他
-不行，只有神通才有能力抵抗黑白
-安昂应该会想出解决方法的
你能不能别破坏房子了，好好听我说话
我只是想做好我沟通桥梁的工作，
你就不能转过来吗？
我命令你现在转过头来
-我就说他需要帮助嘛
-索卡，等等
-很危险啊
-黑白，看招
-索卡，快退后
-让我们并肩作战
-我并不想作战，我只想...
索卡!
皇叔，皇叔，你在哪？
-陛下，他可能以为你没等他就走了
-有些不对劲
-看那堆石头
-好像刚刚发生了土崩
这儿怎么会发生土崩，肯定是人为造成的
皇叔被土宗的人抓走了
安昂，我在这儿呢，来救我
-救我啊
-索卡，坚持住！
索卡
我失败了~
-你们要带我去哪？
-带你去接受审判
-是嘛，但是具体是到哪？
-那是个你相当熟悉的地方
你曾在那里围攻了天，但却无功而返
啊，原来是要去永固城，那真是个好城市
很显然他比你们的城市都要好
我承认我在永固城战败了，
我们那时已经离家天了，
我的士兵们都累了，我也累了
我现在还是很累
-我敢保证，他们一定会回来的
-我也这么想
-你应该休息休息
-一切都会好起来的
你哥哥是个好帮手，降世神通一定会救他回来的
卡塔拉, 卡塔拉, 对不起，我没能救他回来
太阳已经升起来了，他应该很快就会回来了
再说什么？我已经回来了！
我还在灵界
没错了，这是皇叔的鞋
我会想出办法的, 卡塔拉. 我向你保证，我是人间和灵界的桥梁嘛
我只需要想出我该做些什么，想到了就一切OK了
阿柏，伙计，我在这儿呢
我猜你也看不到我了
没事的，阿柏, 他们一定正在回来的路上
我跟你打赌，他们肯定带回一捆月桃给你吃
我该怎么做？罗库大师，我怎样才能找到你？
索卡？是你吗？
那一定不是你
什么？我在灵界居然不能用御气术？
你该不会知道索卡在哪吧？
你是罗库大师的坐骑啊？
就像阿柏是我的坐骑一样，
我得救出我的朋友，但我不知道该怎么做，
你能让我和罗库大师谈谈吗？
卡塔拉，我会回来的
带我去罗库大师那去吧
-怎么了？
-没事，没事
事实上，是有点问题。
我得老关节又酸又疼，这些又镣铐太松了
-太松了?
-没错啊，它们太松了了，
丁呤当啷的，把我的手腕都磨疼了
你行行好吧，把手铐紧紧，好让我舒服舒服
那好吧，士官，把犯人的镣铐紧紧！
啊，你想干嘛？啊！！
我还是不明白，这只是个雕塑，怎样才能和他交谈？
这个就是罗库要和我说的吗？一个彗星？
我啥时候才能和他谈谈？
这就像个日历一样啊，当冬至那天，
当光照耀到雕像的时候
我就能和罗库谈话了吗？
但是我没有时间了，我现在就要救出索卡.
将军，他真是个危险人物，
我们无法把他带到首都去，我们现在得想想办法
我同意，现在必须把他尽快解决掉
没用的, 阿柏，哪也看不到他们
我们最好回村子里去等他们
终于找到你了，降世神通
太好了，你回来了
索卡在哪儿啊？
我也不知道.
这双手太危险，必须把他们碾碎
-招式很靓嘛，祖寇殿下
-哪里哪里，都是您教得好
投降吧，现在是比，你们人数太少了
啊，说的倒是没错，但是你们根本就不是我们的对手
皇叔，现在你可以把衣服穿上了吧
安昂，你愣着干嘛，快跑啊
原来你是森林之魂啊，我了解你的感受
你的家园被烧光了，你很绝望又很生气
当我看到森林被烧毁时，我也很沮丧，
但是我的朋友给了我希望，
她说终有一天森林会长回来的
索卡
-发生啥事了
-你被困在灵界整整个小时了
-你感觉怎么样？
-我得赶紧去上厕所，憋死我了
-感谢你呀，降世神通，
我们真不知道该怎样报答您的恩情
-那就给我们点干粮和盘缠吧
-索卡?
-咋了，我们是需要这些嘛
能为你们的旅程帮忙是我们的荣幸
安昂，我真为你感到自豪，
你全靠自己想出了解决的办法
事实上，是有人帮了我，还有就是...
-什么事？
-我得和罗库谈谈，
我想我找到了和他的魂魄交谈的方法
-太棒了
-够恐怖的，不过也挺酷的
在新月岛上有座寺院，如果我能在冬至日到达那里，
我就能和他谈话了
-明天就是冬至了
-不过还有一个问题
那座岛在火国境内
-=未完待续=-

水善国
土强国
火烈国
气和国
很久以前，这四大国和谐共处
然而，火国发起的战争结束了和平
只有同时掌握四种元素的将世神通才能结束战争
然而在大家最需要他的时候，他却消失了
年后，我和哥哥发现了新的降世神通，
他是个御气师，名叫安昂
尽管他的御气术着实厉害
在拯救苍生之前，他要学的还有很多
但是我坚信安昂能拯救这个世界
