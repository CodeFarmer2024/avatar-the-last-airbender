      Episode: Book One (Water), Chapter Ten
      Title: Jet
      Writer: James Eagan
      Director: Dave Filoni
      Storyboards: Miyuki Hoshikawa, Justin Ridge, Dave Filoni
      Transcriber: Fledgling

      Act I

      (OPEN on a pale blue sky, panning down to reveal the tops of a vast
      deciduous forest. The trees are blanketed in leaves of fiery reds and
      oranges; there is just a hint of green left on one or two. The air is
      alive with the CHIRRPS and WHIRRS of insects. The pan stops on wide
      branch. A little yellow beetle scuttles from around the backside of the
      branch, toward the trunk. The bug is suddenly covered in a rapidly growing
      shadow as MOMO swoops in from above. Before he can catch it, the beetle&#x27;s
      carapace opens like a ladybug&#x27;s, and it flies off while he peeks under his
      paws to see if he got it. Discovering he hasn&#x27;t, Momo leaps after it.

      Cut to the forest from just below canopy level, looking up. The beetle
      flies up the tree trunk with Momo climbing in pursuit and CHITTERING. They
      ring the tree then descend.

      Cut to the base of the tree. A pile of slightly lumpy red nuts sits in the
      foreground. The beetle enters from OC and lands on the ground. Momo lands
      in a pounce from the same direction, but once again the beetle flies off
      before he can catch it. He watches it, then notices the fruit.

      The camera pulls back to reveal the neat pile of about a dozen or so
      apple-like nuts sitting on a pile of leaves. Other than the leaf pile, the
      ground is bare dirt. Momo&#x27;s ears prick straight up.

      Cut to the little clearing with the pile of fruit. Momo pounces on it from
      OC. Suddenly, copper-colored slats snap up from the leaves and surround
      him in a globe. The snare&#x27;s slats run longitudinally; the �poles� are
      parallel to the ground. The globe shifts so that the �north pole&#x27; is on
      top and the camera pans up into the canopy as the snare and its cargo
      spring into the air, where two other snares hang.

      Cut to a place just below canopy level. Momo&#x27;s snare comes to a jerking
      stop at about the same level in the air as the two other snares. They are
      also occupied: large brown baboon-like animals BARK noisily, as they hold
      onto the slats like prison bars and pull on them. The momentum of the
      ascent leaves Momo&#x27;s snare�and Momo�spinning.

      Cut to another clearing in the forest. Between trees AANG, KATARA, SOKKA
      and APPA are visible at the far end, taking a break from travel.)

      Aang: Where&#x27;s Momo?

      (Momo&#x27;s yowl echoes through the forest.)

      (Cut to Aang standing in the foreground with Katara and Sokka sitting on
      the ground. They look around, trying to tell where the call came from.

      Fade to the clearing with the snares, looking up from ground level. Aang
      wanders in from OC, drawn by Momo&#x27;s urgent CALLS. With a sweep of his
      arms, He airbends to leap, climbing to Momo&#x27;s height by rebounding up off
      close-by tree trunks.)

      Aang: Hang on Momo!

      (Cut to a tree branch. It extends out of a main part of the tree. Attached
      to the trunk is a small winch. A rope enters the winch from lower on the
      trunk OC, then continues up to an eyeloop bolt attached to the underside
      of the branch, before hanging straight down. Aang ascends in from OC. He
      sits, then flips over the branch and dangles beneath it like an acrobat on
      a trapeze. He grabs the rope, releases a latch on the winch, and carefully
      feeds more line.

      Cut to the ground, as Sokka and Katara ease the snare down to the ground
      between them and together pull the squeaky slats apart enough to make an
      exit. Momo immediately hops out and runs to the foreground to finish a
      handful of the nuts, his peril forgotten. Sokka and Katara release the
      snare, and Sokka GROANS and slaps his forehead at the lack of gratitude.
      Aang jumps down from above and looks up. Sokka and Katara also look up.

      Cut to the other two snares. The Hog Monkeys in them MOAN pleadingly. The
      traps are suspended near each other on a different branch.)

      Aang: All right�you too.

      (He crouches, then springs up in a spiraling column of airbent wind that
      carries him up to the camera and OC. Sokka reaches behind.)

      Sokka: This is gonna take forever.

      (Sokka throws his boomerang in one fluid move; with a WHIZ it zips up and
      OC.

      Just below the branch, the ropes come from opposite directions, but they
      parallel each other as they hang down from curved staples. With a WHIZ,
      the boomerang enters and exists the scene, cutting the both ropes in the
      process. The ropes fall away; There&#x27;s the sound of CRASHES and panicked
      beast BARKS.

      The camera pans slightly as Aang arrives from OC: he&#x27;s hanging below the
      branch and hugging it as he inches over to the first staple. He pauses to
      look upside-down at the ground below.)

      Aang: That works�

      (On the ground, the hog monkeys are loose; their cages like open
      clamshells. They walk on all fours to the foreground. One disappears
      between the framing trees, the other climbs up the tree framing the left
      and disappears. Sokka approaches one of the busted snares and kneels to
      examine it, as Aang enters by skidding down the trunk and root of a tree
      in the background.)

      Sokka: These are Fire Nation traps�you can tell from the metalwork. We&#x27;d
      better pack up camp, and get moving.

      (Sokka&#x27;s hands pull taught the bindings on a roll of gear.

      Cut to the clearing from over Aang&#x27;s shoulder. Katara hands a gear roll up
      to Aang, who is sitting on Appa&#x27;s head. Sokka sees this. He leaves his
      roll and walks over to them.)

      Sokka: Ah-ah�no flying this time.

      Katara: What?

      (Aang hands the roll to Sokka, who puts it on the ground.)

      Aang: Why wouldn&#x27;t we fly?

      Sokka: Think about it. Somehow Prince Zuko and the Fire Nation keep
      finding us. It&#x27;s because they spot Appa�he&#x27;s just too noticeable.

      Katara: What! Appa&#x27;s not too noticeable!

      Sokka: He&#x27;s a gigantic fluffy monster with an arrow on his head�it&#x27;s kinda
      hard to miss him!

      (Appa turns his head and GROANS at Sokka. Aang is in the �driver&#x27;s seat&#x27;
      holding his reigns.)

      Aang (gently to Appa,): Sokka&#x27;s just jealous �cause he doesn&#x27;t have an
      arrow.

      Sokka (to Aang OC): I know you all want to fly, but my instincts tell me
      we should play it safe this time and walk.

      Katara: Who made you the boss?

      Sokka: I&#x27;m not the boss�I&#x27;m the leader.

      Katara (incredulous): You&#x27;re the leader? But your voice still cracks!

      Sokka: I&#x27;m the oldest and I&#x27;m a warrior. (tries to speak deeper) So�I&#x27;m
      the leader!

      Katara: If anyone&#x27;s the leader, it&#x27;s Aang. I mean, he is the Avatar.

      Sokka: Are you kidding�he&#x27;s just a goofy kid!

      (Cut to Aang, dangling from Appa&#x27;s horn: upside-down by his hands with his
      legs sticking out into space. Appa looks rather unimpressed.)

      Aang: He&#x27;s right.

      (Cut to Katara and Sokka again. Sokka has his pack on his back.)

      Katara: Why do boys always think someone has to be the leader? I bet you
      wouldn&#x27;t be so bossy if you kissed a girl.

      Sokka: I-I&#x27;ve kissed a girl�you�just haven&#x27;t met her.

      Katara: Who? Gran-gran? I&#x27;ve met Gran-gran.

      Sokka: No�besides Gran-gran. Look, my instincts tell me we have a better
      chance of slipping through on foot and a leader has to trust his
instincts.

      Katara: Okay, we&#x27;ll try it your way Oh Wise Leader.

      (Aang steps over, now wearing a backpack. Momo is sitting on the top.)

      Aang: Who knows�walking might be fun.

      (Cut to the forest. Between trees the group trudges along, with Sokka in
      front, followed by Aang/Momo, Katara and Appa)

      Aang (cont.): Walking stinks! How do people go anywhere without a flying
      bison?

      Katara: I don&#x27;t know Aang. Why don&#x27;t you ask Sokka&#x27;s instincts�they seem
      to know everything.

      Sokka: Ha ha. Very funny.

      Aang: I&#x27;m tired of carrying this pack.

      Katara: You know who you should ask to carry it for a while? Sokka&#x27;s
      Instincts!

      Aang: That&#x27;s a great idea! Hey, Sokka&#x27;s Instincts, would you mind�

      Sokka: Okay, okay�I get it. Look guys, I&#x27;m tired too. But the important
      thing is that--

      (He pushes the branches from two rust red-leafed bushes and holds them,
      focussing his attention on Aang and Katara.)--we&#x27;re safe from�the�(He
      finally turns around to see what&#x27;s beyond the bushes.)--Fire...Nation�

      (Sokka, Aang Katara and Momo have just walked into a clearing with a Fire
      Nation encampment in it. On the opposite end of the clearing are three
      Pavilion tents, and an active fire pit with logs as benches on two sides.
      The camp is occupied.

      Cut to the reaction of the soldiers�most of them seated or crouching near
      the fire with bowls in hand. The surprise of others. On a couple of
      soldiers seated closest to the tents, which have doorflaps with the Fire
      Nation emblem on them. One of these soldiers has a patch over his left
eye.

      Back to Momo and the Trio.)

      Sokka: RUN!

      (As they drop their packs, The soldiers leap up from the logs, swords out.
      The one-eyed soldier takes a bender&#x27;s stance and launches a fist-full of
      fire at them. The fire misses them�mostly�but sets the bushes behind them
      alight.)

      Sokka: We&#x27;re cut off! (Meanwhile, the left sleeve of his tunic is on
fire.)

      Aang: Sokka, your shirt!

      (Sokka looks, and YELLS in panic.

      Katara uncorks a skin container and begins to bend the contents�water�into
      a flowing ribbon. The ribbon splashes against Sokka&#x27;s tunic, putting it
      out. Katara redirects the ribbon back into the waterskin and replaces the
      cap.

      The trio is surrounded: the burning bushes behind them, the soldiers all
      around. They put their backs together and face the warriors, ready to
      fight if necessary.)

      Sokka: If you let us pass, we promise not to hurt you.

      Katara (quietly): What are you doing?

      Sokka: Bluffing?

      (The One-eyed Captain smiles from his lines.)

      Captain: You? Promise not to hurt us?

      (There is a quiet ZIP and THUD. The Captain looks surprised for a moment,
      then groans and collapses face first on the ground. His men lower their
      weapons a little.)

      Aang: Nice work, Sokka! How&#x27;d ya do that?

      Sokka: Uh�instinct?

      Katara: Look!

      (She points to somewhere above. Blur to a figure standing on the massive
      branch of a nearby tree. The person drops something and draws two blades
      from the middle of his back.. He steps off the back of the branch, his
      weapons held high. Instead of falling straight down, the weapons seem to
      catch on the branch, allowing him to sling himself in the direction of the
      camp. The stranger kicks over two of the soldiers farthest from the Trio;
      he lands with a foot on each of their backs.

      He is JET. He is a young man�about Sokka&#x27;s age. Except for a red vest,
      he&#x27;s dressed from neck to toe in dark green clothing. What little armor he
      has (shoulder caps and hip/upper thigh covers) are mismatched. He has a
      shaggy mane of brown hair, and a twig held in his teeth.

      He rushes forward, his shuang gou (twin hook sword) in each hand. He hooks
      a leg each on another pair of soldiers and sends them head over heels.
      With a polished body flip, he launches them through the air. They end up
      in a heap on top of their prone captain.
      Jet lands on his feet, ready for more.)

      Jet: Down you go.

      (The trio looks up from the little pile-up at him. They&#x27;ve gone from
      surprise to varying degrees of pleasure (Katara) awe (Aang) and
      incredulity (Sokka).

      A soldier rushes up from behind Jet, sword raised. The young man hooks his
      opponent&#x27;s sword hand as he spins. Jet finishes where he started�ready to
      face a new opponent�while his opponent is sent flying. The man lands at
      the feet of a quartet of sword holders. The closest then looks up.)

      Soldier: They&#x27;re in the trees!

      (A small boy drops from above and lands on the soldier&#x27;s shoulders, then
      spins his helmet around, blinding him. He staggers off, his small attacker
      still on his shoulders and laughing all the while. Before the remaining
      three swordsmen can react, arrows ZIP from above, disarming each man
      without hurting him.

      Blur up to the archer sitting on a branch. He reaches for a quiver on his
      back and fits two arrows to the string of his bow. The archer swings
      backward, until he is hanging beneath the branch by his knees. He lets his
      arrows fly.

      Cut to another quartet of soldiers. The foremost two have their swords
      knocked from their hands by the arrows, while an individual leaps from a
      low branch to the ground.
      As the two disarmed soldiers run off, a swordsman charges the newcomer.
      This freedom fighter ducks, lets the swordsman run into (and across) his
      back, and tosses his opponent up onto the branch with a shrug. The second
      swordsman is more cautious, but with speed and strength the rebel grabs
      him, spins him around and throws him. The barehanded rebel turns and heads
      for new targets before his old one hits the ground. Meanwhile, a boy with
      a knife and red facepaint drops to the foreground and runs off to fight.

      Cut to Jet, who watches over his shoulder as Katara uses her water to take
      on an OC foe and beside her Aang bends the air, dragging two soldiers in a
      dusty circle around the pair.

      Cut to Sokka, boomerang raised in both hands, shouting a war cry. A
      soldier charges him, but before they meet Jet enters the scene. He uses
      his swords to pole vault him into the chest of the swordsman, who goes
      flying in the opposite direction OC. Sokka stops shouting and sags out of
      his battle stance.)

      Sokka: Hey, he was mine!

      Jet: Gotta be quicker next time.

      (Jet turns and rejoins the battle. Katara is left impressed, while a
      grumpy Sokka walks off,

      Cut to two soldiers backing towards the forest, but before they can
      escape, a massive rebel drops to the ground. As they turn to face him,
      their faces register shock as he comes out of his drop crouch�and towers
      above them. Quickly however, they recover and take a battle stance. The
      grinning giant simply reaches over his shoulder and pulls out a log
      thicker than a man&#x27;s leg. He raises it two-handed over his head, and with
      a growl lowers the boom.

      Jet turns from his current opponent to watch the two swordsman backing
      away, their swords bent beyond use. They drop them and flee. He grins and
      turns to face the determined spearman. The man jabs for his throat, but he
      catches the spearshaft with the hooks of his swords. They struggle for a
      moment, before Jet spins and sidesteps the spear. With one sword free, he
      hooks the man, who goes flying. The soldier&#x27;s spear is also sent flying.
      Its butt-end strikes the back of a nearby swordsman&#x27;s helmet, knocking him
      out. The sagging soldier reveals his opponent to be Sokka, ready to
      receive an attack with his war club. He looks at the downed man.)

      Sokka (frustrated): Man!

      (Another spearman attempts to strike at Jet from behind. Just in time Jet
      catches the spearpoint in the space between the grip and the
      crescent-shaped guard of his sword and redirects it away from his head.
      The soldier quickly follows the spear, pushing it free and facing the
      young man again with a flourish. Jet also quickly recovers his stance. Jet
      catches the speartip with his hooks this time and angles the spear into
      the ground. He runs up it, leaps, kicks off the back of the soldier&#x27;s
      helmet and stumbles a few steps forward before stopping in front of Katara
      as if he&#x27;d meant to do all of it.)

      Jet (nonchalantly): Hey.

      Katara: Hi.

      (Together they turn to take in the camp, now deserted by all but the
      newcomers.)

      Aang (awed): You just took out a whole army almost single-handed!

      Sokka: Army? Pfft. There were only, like, twenty guys!

      Jet: My name is Jet, and these are my Freedom Fighters. Sneers--

      (The Weaponless rebel, who is eating from one of the soldier&#x27;s bowls)

      --Longshot (The archer; he raises his paddy-hat covered head at his name)

      --Smellerbee (The rebel with the facepaint and knife. His knife between
      his teeth, a captured Fire Nation Sword slung across his back and he has
      one in each hand. He brandishes them when Jet names him)

      --The Duke and Pipsqueak. (They are standing next to each other. The Duke
      is the littlest rebel, the one who rode the soldier&#x27;s shoulders. He raises
      his quarterstaff slightly at his name. Pipsqueak is the giant, who puts
      his log away as his name is called.

      Aang walks up to the Duke and Pipsqueak.)

      Aang (to the Duke, chuckling): Pipsqueak�that&#x27;s a funny name.

      (The Duke sniffles, his nose is runny and his helmet hides shed tears. Pan
      up to the �real� Pipsqueak, slightly glowering. He bends down.)

      Pipsqueak: You think my name is funny?

      (Aang looks a little nervous. He plasters a smile on his face.)

      Aang: It&#x27;s hilarious.

      (Back on Pipsqueak, who goes from glower to guffaw in a heartbeat. Aang,
      Pipsqueak and the Duke share the laugh together. Pipsqueak slaps Aang on
      the back, which unintentionally knocks the Avatar flat. The Duke stops
      laughing, but smiles again when Aang looks up and chuckles weakly: all
      among friends.)

      FADE OUT.

      ACT II

      (FADE IN on the Fire Nation camp. The central fire is out, and members of
      Jet&#x27;s freedom fighters are near it, checking weapons (Longshot) or
      investigating supply crates (Sneers). Sokka watches as Smellerbee passes
      him with an armful of staves.

      Jet is reclining against the trunk of a tree on the perimeter of the camp.
      Katara approaches.)

      Katara: Um�thanks for saving us Jet. We were lucky you were there.

      Jet: I should be thanking you. We were waiting to ambush those soldiers
      all morning�we just needed the right distraction. And then you guys
      stumbled in.

      Katara: We were relying on instincts.

      Jet: You&#x27;ll get yourself killed doing that.

      (Sokka is close enough to hear the conversation. He closes his eyes in
      frustration at his bad call and walks away. Behind him, Pipsqueak and the
      Duke investigate the inside of a barrel next to one of the pavilion tents.
      The Duke reaches in and pulls away a finger coated with green goo. He
      sniffs it experimentally.)

      The Duke: Hey Jet�these barrels are filled with blasting jelly.

      Jet: That&#x27;s a great score.

      (Pipsqueak holds up a large crate.)

      Pipsqueak: And these boxes are filled with jelly candy!

      Jet: Also good. Let&#x27;s not get those mixed up.

      (Aang and Momo watch Pipsqueak, the Duke and Sneers loading up a
      four-wheeled wagon.)

      Pipsqueak: We&#x27;ll take the stuff back to the hideout.

      Aang: You guys have a hideout?

      Jet: You wanna see it?

      (Katara literally slides up to him from OC. Her hands are clasped
      together; she&#x27;s practically begging.)

      Katara: Yes we wanna see it!

      (Cut to Jet&#x27;s face. His brow softens, but his self-assured smile never
      wavers.
      Fade to everyone walking along the forest floor. Pipsqueak pulls the laden
      wagon next to Appa. The trunks are massive enough to make even Appa small.
      In front, Jet has stopped)

      Jet: We&#x27;re here.

      Sokka: Where�there&#x27;s nothing here!

      Jet: Hold this.

      (Jet hands Sokka a rope with a loop on the end. The other end is somewhere
      above them.)

      Sokka: Why�what&#x27;s this do?

      (The loop ends up around Sokka&#x27;s wrist. Without warning, he is pulled up
      by his arm into a nearby tree canopy. As a final insult, Sokka gets
      momentarily stuck in the leafy branches before he disappears.)

      Sokka: Woah!

      (Jet offers a similar rope to Aang and Momo.)

      Jet: Aang?

      Aang: I&#x27;ll get up on my own.

      (Momo launches himself from Aang&#x27;s shoulder. Aang follows with an
      Airbender leap. Jet holds a rope and offers his free hand to Katara.)

      Jet: Grab hold of me Katara.

      (She takes his hand. The colors take on a softer quality as he pulls her
      into a spin that ends with her against his chest. She blushes noticeably.
      The rope slowly pulls them into the air, the embrace Katara&#x27;s only means
      of support.. She smiles nervously then looks around and up at Jet. He
      focuses on their ascent: the handsome heroic rogue.

      Cut to a plank-covered platform high in the canopy. Color is back to
      normal. Jet and Katara rise through a hole in the �floor&#x27; then land on it
      with a jump when jet lets go of the still ascending rope. Wooden stairs
      spiral up the trunk and suspension bridge links their platform to
      elsewhere. All workmanship is of �treehouse&#x27; quality.

      Aang and Momo slide across the scene on a foreground rope.)

      Aang: Nice place you got!

      (As Jet and Katara walk towards the bridge, the shot pans to reveal
      several nearby trees have the same platforms, stairs and bridges. Several
      platforms have tent-like huts.

      Cut to Jet and Katara surveying the parts of the tree village below them.)

      Katara: It&#x27;s beautiful up here!

      Jet: It&#x27;s beautiful�and more importantly the Fire Nation can&#x27;t find us.

      (Smellerbee releases his rope and lands near them.)

      Smellerbee: They would love to find you. Wouldn&#x27;t they, Jet?

      Jet: It&#x27;s not gonna happen, Smellerbee.

      (A couple of sentries watch from above as Momo and Aang zipline by again.
      The others are walking along a bridge.)

      Katara: Why does the Fire Nation want to find you?

      Jet: I guess you could say I&#x27;ve been causing them a little trouble. See,
      they took over a nearby Earth Kingdom town a few years back.

      (cut to Jet and Katara leading the group. Pipsqueak is right behind.)

      Pipsqueak: We&#x27;ve been ambushin&#x27; their troops, cutting off their supply
      lines, and doing anything we can to mess with �em.

      (Sokka is doing his level best to see over Pipsqueak�he keeps hopping to
      get a peek over the giant&#x27;s shoulders.)

      Jet: One day, we&#x27;ll drive the Fire Nation out of here for good and free
      that town.

      Katara: That&#x27;s so brave.

      (Sokka comes up from behind�he&#x27;s somehow made it past Pipsqueak.)

      Sokka (Sarcastically): Yeah, nothing&#x27;s braver than a guy in a treehouse.

      Katara: Don&#x27;t pay any attention to my brother.

      Jet: No problem. He probably had a rough day.

      Katara: So, you all live here?

      (Sokka, ignored, sinks back behind them.)

      Jet: That&#x27;s right. Longshot over there?

      (cut to Longshot and the Duke walking silently. Longshot&#x27;s head is
      slightly bowed)

      Jet (cont.): His town got burned down by the fire Nation. And we found the
      Duke trying to steal our food. I don&#x27;t think he ever really had a home.

      Katara: What about you?

      (Jet stops. The group, except for Katara moves on.)

      Jet: Fire Nation killed my parents. I was only eight years old. That day
      changed me forever.

      Katara: Sokka and I lost our mother to the Fire Nation.

      Jet: I&#x27;m so sorry, Katara.

      (Fade from the two of them alone on the suspension bridge, looking out, to
      the blue sky above the canopy. A cloud of cawing birds is disturbed as
      Appa raises his head through the dense leafy branches with a grumble.

      In the hideout below, Ropes with Glowing lanterns hang between branches.
      Sentries keep watch on several upper platforms while the group sits at a
      banquet table on a huge platform.

      While the group eating and drinking. Jet stands and climbs onto the
table.)

      Jet: Today, we struck another blow against the Fire Nation swine.

      (His followers at the table and on upper platforms cheer. Katara and Aang
      watch with smiles, Sokka looks grumpy.)

      Jet: I got a special joy from the look on one soldier&#x27;s face, when the
      Duke dropped down on his helmet and rode him like a wild hog monkey.

      (The helmet-less Duke is sitting on the platform between Longshot and
      Smellerbee. He stands, joins Jet on the table and amid cheers takes a
      victory walk around a fish platter.)

      Jet: Now, the Fire Nation thinks they don&#x27;t have to worry about a couple
      of kids hiding in the trees. (He prepares to take a drink from his wooden
      cup) Maybe they&#x27;re right.

      (His followers BOO at that.)

      Jet (cont.): Or maybe�they are dead wrong.

      (His face is bathed in an angry red from the lanterns. His followers CHEER
      wildly. He leaves the table and sits on the platform between Sokka and
      Katara)

      Katara: Hey Jet, nice speech.

      Jet: Thanks. By the way, I was really impressed with you and Aang. That
      was some great bending I saw out there today.

      Katara: Well, he&#x27;s great. He&#x27;s the Avatar. I could use some more training.
      (She blushes.)

      Jet: Avatar huh? Very nice.

      Aang: Thanks Jet.

      Jet: So I might know a way that you and Aang can help in our struggle.

      Sokka: Unfortunately we have to leave tonight. (He stands and walks away.)

      Jet: Sokka, you&#x27;re kidding me! I needed you on an important mission
      tomorrow.

      (Sokka stops, and turns.)

      Sokka: What mission?

      (Fade to the top of the forest the next day. Jet and Sokka are perched in
      branches on the same tree. Jet cups his hands and makes a whistle like a
      birdcall; several trees down Pipsqueak and Smellerbee step into view from
      their branches. There is a reply call.

      Sokka rams his jawbone knife into the trunk of the tree.)

      Jet: What are you doing?

      Sokka: Shh�it amplifies vibrations.

      Jet (impressed): Good trick.

      (Sokka cups his hands around the pommel �bone&#x27; and puts his ear to it.)

      Sokka: Nothing yet. (Lowers his voice) Wait! Yes, someone&#x27;s approaching.

      Jet (low voice): How many?

      Sokka: I think there&#x27;s just one.

      (Jet whistles again.)

      Jet: Good work, Sokka. Ready your weapon.

      (Sokka pulls the knife out of the tree and waits. His eyes go wide when
      the �someone&#x27; comes into view: a stooped OLD MAN with a cane. He wears a
      simple red robe.)

      Sokka (Low): Wait! False alarm�he&#x27;s just an old man.

      (Jet stands and extends his hook swords anyway, then leaps to the ground
      in front of the traveler. Sokka watches with horror.)

      Jet: What are you doing in our woods, you leech.

      Old Man: Please sir, I&#x27;m just a traveler.

      (Jet takes a step, and with one swipe of his sword sends the man&#x27;s can
      flying from his hand. The old man backs away, but when he tries to flee
      the way he came, he runs face first into Pipsqueak&#x27;s chest. The force of
      the impact knocks him to the ground; the giant looms over him. He tries to
      crawl away, but Pipsqueak&#x27;s foot on his backside effectively pins him.)

      Jet: Do you like destroying towns? Do you like destroying families? Do
      you?!

      Old Man (frightened): Oh�please let me go�have mercy�

      Jet: Does the Fire Nation let people go?! Does the Fire Nation have
mercy?!

      (Jet winds up a kick, but his foot is snagged by Sokka&#x27;s club before it
      can be delivered. Sokka releases him)

      Sokka: Jet, he&#x27;s just an old man!

      Jet: He&#x27;s Fire Nation! Search him!

      (Pipsqueak holds the prisoner and Smellerbee steps up)

      Sokka: But he&#x27;s not hurting anyone!

      Jet: Have you forgotten that the Fire Nation killed your mother? Remember
      why you fight!

      Smellerbee: We&#x27;ve got his stuff, Jet. (He holds up a shoulder satchel the
      old man was carrying. The old man is back on the ground.)

      Sokka: This doesn&#x27;t feel right.

      Jet: It&#x27;s what has to be done�now let&#x27;s get outta here.

      (Jet pushes past Sokka. Pipsqueak and Smellerbee follow. Sokka looks at
      the old man still on his hands and knees.)

      Jet: Come on Sokka!

      (Sokka slowly turns then runs after the others.

      At the hideout, Aang and Momo are playing with the ziplines again. He
      leaps to a platform.)

      Aang: Sokka! Look what the Duke gave me!

      (Aang is wearing a satchel�not the old man&#x27;s�and pulls a small pellet from
      it. With a sly grin, he tosses it at the platform next to Momo, where it
      explodes with a pop. Momo puffs up like a startled cat. He GROWLS, then
      lunges for the satchel. Momo then sits on Aang&#x27;s shoulder and tosses
      pellets at his feet. Aang dances about wildly.)

      Aang: Ow! Quit it!

      (Sokka is oblivious of it all. He&#x27;s sitting with his back to the trunk and
      staring at the platform before him, frowning. Katara walks up.)

      Katara: Hey Sokka. Is Jet back?

      Sokka: Yeah�he&#x27;s back. But we&#x27;re leaving.

      Aang: What?

      Katara: But I made him this hat.

      (She pulls from behind her back a cap made out of stitched leaves with a
      flower on top. The workmanship is unimpressive.)

      Sokka: Your boyfriend Jet&#x27;s a thug.

      Katara: What? No, he&#x27;s not.

      Sokka: He&#x27;s messed up Katara.

      Aang: He&#x27;s not messed up, he&#x27;s just got a different way of life�a really
      fun way of life.

      Sokka: He beat and robbed a harmless old man!

      Katara: I wanna hear Jet&#x27;s side of the story.

      (Cut to Jet.)

      Jet: Sokka�you told them what happened but you didn&#x27;t mention that the guy
      was Fire Nation?

      (Jet and the trio are in a lantern-lit hut: at least one wall is made of
      wood. Jet is sitting on a hammock-bed, the others stand. Sokka stands
      grumpily as far away as he can get. Aang is wearing the hat Katara made;
      he looks like an acorn)

      Katara: No, he conveniently left that part out.

      Sokka: Fine! But even if he was Fire Nation, he was a harmless civilian

      Jet: He was an assassin, Sokka.

      (Jet pulls out a knife and thrusts it into a nearby block of wood. It is a
      sinister looking curved blade. There are four spikes evenly spaced along
      the grip, with enough space for fingers to go between them. There is a
      ring on the butt of the knife.)

      Jet (cont.): See? There&#x27;s a compartment for poison in the knife. (He pulls
      on the ring and removes a small glass tube filled with red liquid). He was
      sent to eliminate me�you helped save my life, Sokka.

      Katara: I knew there was an explanation

      Sokka: I didn&#x27;t see any knife!

      Jet: That&#x27;s because he was concealing it.

      Katara: See Sokka? I&#x27;m sure you just didn&#x27;t notice the knife.

      Sokka: There was no knife! I&#x27;m going back to the hut and packing my
things.
      (He leaves.)

      Jet: Tell me you guys aren&#x27;t leaving yet. I really need your help.

      Aang: What can we do?

      Jet: The Fire Nation is planning on burning down our forest. If you both
      use water bending to fill the reservoir, we could fight the fires. But if
      you leave now, they&#x27;ll destroy the whole valley.

      (Aang and Katara look at each other. Fade to them entering their hut.
      Sokka is tying up a roll on the floor.)

      Katara: We can&#x27;t leave now with the Fire Nation about to burn down a
      forest!

      Sokka: I&#x27;m sorry Katara. Jet&#x27;s very smooth, but we can&#x27;t trust him.

      Katara: You know what I think? You&#x27;re jealous that he&#x27;s a better warrior
      and a better leader!

      Sokka: Katara, I&#x27;m not jealous of Jet. It&#x27;s just that my instinct�

      Katara: Well my instincts tell me we need to stay here a little longer and
      help Jet. Come on Aang.

      Aang: Sorry Sokka.

      (They leave the hut. Fade to the night sky above the canopy. A full moon
      shines on Appa, who is on his back and snoring up a storm as he sleeps.
      Inside the Trio&#x27;s hut, Sokka sleeps propped up against his still-packed
      gear while the others sleep in their bedrolls.)

      Jet: Let&#x27;s go.

      (Sokka stirs then snaps awake. He pulls the door flap aside enough to see
      some of Jet&#x27;s followers descending on the rope lines. He leaves the hut,
      and takes a rope line down to a lower branch. On the ground below him,
      Jet&#x27;s freedom fighters are quietly pushing the loaded wagon as Jet leads
      them out of the camp. Sokka stealthily follows.

      In the dark valley, the walled town sits on the far side of a river that
      cuts through the forest. Upstream, and up toward the wall of the valley
      there is an old falls, and beyond that a man-made dam. A bare cliff off to
      the reservoir&#x27;s left provides the view.

      Jet and his boys emerge form the forest. He goes to the edge and looks
      down on the dam below. The reservoir behind it is low. He turns back to
      the wagon.)

      Jet: Now listen�you are not to blow the dam until I give the signal. If
      the reservoir isn&#x27;t full, the Fire Nation troops could survive.

      (The Duke jumps off the wagon.)

      Duke: But what about the people in the town�won&#x27;t they get wiped out too?

      (Jet places a hand on the Duke&#x27;s shoulder.)

      Jet: Look Duke, that&#x27;s the price of ridding this area of the Fire Nation.
      (to Longshot): Now don&#x27;t blow the dam until I give the signal�got it?

      (Longshot nods. Sokka watches incredulously from the bushes. He frowns,
      and hears rustling just before Pipsqueak drags him out by his topknot.
      Smellerbee&#x27;s knife is instantly at his throat.)

      Smellerbee (sneering): Where do you think you&#x27;re going, ponytail?

      FADE OUT.

      ACT III

      (FADE IN on Jet, standing near the edge of the cliff. As he watches,
      Pipsqueak and Smellerbee drag Sokka between them. Pipsqueak still has a
      handful of Sokka&#x27;s topknot.)

      Jet: Sokka. I&#x27;m glad you decided to join us.

      (His captors send Sokka to his knees. He rubs his shoulder.)

      Sokka: I heard your plan to destroy the Earth Kingdom town.

      Jet: Our plan is to rid the valley of the Fire Nation.

      Sokka: There are people living there Jet�mothers and fathers and children.

      Jet: We can&#x27;t win without making some sacrifices.

      (Sokka points an accusing finger at Jet.)

      Sokka: You lied to Aang and Katara about the forest fire!

      Jet: Because they don&#x27;t understand the demands of war. Not like you and I
      do.

      Sokka: I do understand. I understand that there&#x27;s nothing you won&#x27;t do to
      get what you want.

      Jet: I was hoping you&#x27;d have an open mind, but I can see you&#x27;ve made your
      choice.

      (Pipsqueak and Smellerbee grab for Sokka. Before he can even react, Jet
      has his wrist pinned with the hooks of his shuang gou. Sokka&#x27;s other hand
      is forced behind his back.

      Jet (cont.): I can&#x27;t let you warn Katara and Aang. (Jet releases Sokka&#x27;s
      hand; it is immediately forced behind his back.) Take him for a walk--a
      long walk.

      Sokka: You can&#x27;t do this!

      Jet: Cheer up, Sokka. We&#x27;re gonna win a great victory against the Fire
      Nation today.

      (Fade to the riverside upriver from the dam. The collected water behind it
      is much less than the larger cavity of the reservoir. The river leading to
      down to it is a thread compared to its �rainy season&#x27; gully. Jet, Katara
      and Aang are seen walking upriver along its west bank.)

      Katara: Jet�I&#x27;m sorry about how Sokka&#x27;s been acting.

      Jet: No worries�he already apologized.

      Aang: Really? (Aang and Katara stop and look at one another.) Sokka
      apologized?

      Jet: Yeah�I was surprised too. I got the sense that maybe you talked to
      him or something.

      Katara: Yeah, I did.

      Jet: I guess something you said got through to him. Anyhow, he went out on
      a scouting mission with Pipsqueak and Smellerbee.

      Katara: I&#x27;m glad he cooled off. He&#x27;s so stubborn sometimes.

      (They are now walking in the gully, beside the �river&#x27;. Aang pauses after
      noticing something strange, then is launched into the air by a blast from
      the geyser he was standing on.)

      Jet: All right, we&#x27;re here. Underground water&#x27;s trying to escape through
      these vents. I need you guys to help it along.

      Katara: �I&#x27;ve never used bending on water I can&#x27;t see. I don&#x27;t know�

      (Jet stands behind her and places his hands on her shoulders.)

      Jet: Katara. You can do this.

      Aang (back on the ground): What about me?

      Jet: I know the Avatar can do this.

      (Aang and Katara stand on either side of one of the many smoking holes in
      the gully. While Jet looks on, they perform bending gestures: they look
      like they are encouraging something up. After a few minutes, a bloby
      stream of water emerges from the hole. They pull it to their height, then
      send it toward the river where it continues to flow like a giant garden
      hose. The water quickly joins the river.)

      Jet: Yes! Good job! This river empties into the reservoir--a few more
      geysers and it&#x27;ll be full.

      Aang: Look, there&#x27;s another steam vent.

      (Aang and Katara walk off in its direction.)

      Jet: Okay. You two keep it up�I&#x27;ll go check on things at the reservoir.
      (He turns and walks away.)

      Katara: When we&#x27;re done we&#x27;ll meet you over there.

      Jet: Actually�probably better if you meet me back at the hideout when
      you&#x27;re done.

      (Jet resumes walking away Aang and Katara bend the next geyser into
      another fountain.)

      Aang: �I bet that&#x27;s enough�and I&#x27;m not just saying that to be lazy.

      (Around them, a half dozen fountains flow into the river.)

      Katara: Let&#x27;s catch up with Jet at the reservoir.

      Aang: I thought we agreed to meet Jet back at the hideout.

      Katara: Well, we finished early--I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll be happy to see us.

      (Fade from Katara to a path in the forest. Pipsqueak and Smellerbee follow
      Sokka, who has his hands tied behind his back. Smellerbee gives his
      prisoner a shove; Sokka stumbles but remains on his feet.)

      Smellerbee: Come on�move along!

      Sokka: How can you stand by and do nothing while Jet wipes out a whole
      town?

      Pipsqueak: Hey listen Sokka, Jet&#x27;s a great leader. We follow what he says,
      and things always turn out okay.

      (Sokka notices a couple of snare leaf-piles nearby. They identical to the
      one that enticed Momo, right down to the pile of nuts.)

      Sokka: If that&#x27;s how Jet leads, then he&#x27;s got a lot to learn.

      (Sokka sprints off in the direction of the snares. Smellerbee makes a grab
      for him, but misses.)

      Smellerbee: Hey!

      (They give chase. Sokka leaps over the leaf piles. Pipsqueak and
      Smellerbee don&#x27;t, and end up snared and hanging many feet up in the air.)

      Sokka: While you two are up there you might want to practice your
      knot-work. (He holds up his now-worthless bindings, then turns and walks
      away.)

      Pipsqueak: Hey Smellerbee�you gonna eat your leechee nuts? (A nut strikes
      him in the head and lands in the pile he&#x27;s holding.) Ooh. (He picks one up
      and licks his lips.)

      (Katara and Aang are standing on the edge of the cliff. At the base of the
      dam, four of Jet&#x27;s people are unloading barrels from the wagon and
      arranging them.)

      Katara: �What are they doing?

      Aang: Hey, those are the red barrels he got from the Fire Nation.

      Katara: Why would they need blasting jelly?

      (Zoom on Aang, as he gets it.)

      Aang: Because Jet&#x27;s gonna blow up the dam.

      Katara: What? No--that would destroy the town. Jet wouldn&#x27;t do that.

      (Aang snaps his glider wings open.)

      Aang: I&#x27;ve gotta stop him. (He runs for the edge.)

      Katara (less convinced): Jet wouldn&#x27;t do that.

      (Before Aang can reach the edge, Jet crosses his path from behind and
      snatches the glider. Aang is left wobbling precariously on the edge, and
      uses an airbending move to get himself back on stable footing.)

      Jet: Yes I would.

      Katara: Jet�why?

      Jet: Katara, you would too if you just stopped to think. Think about what
      the Fire Nation did to your mother�we can&#x27;t let them do that to anyone
      else, ever again.

      Katara: This isn&#x27;t the answer!

      Jet: I want you to understand me Katara. I thought your brother would
      understand, but�

      Katara: Where&#x27;s Sokka.

      (Tears fall from her eyes. Jet reaches out and touches her face.)

      Jet: Katara.

      (She bows her head, then with a SHOUT sends Jet flying with the water from
      her waterskin. She draws it back into the skin when she&#x27;s done.)

      Aang: I need to get to the dam.

      (Aang&#x27;s closed glider is on the ground. As he reaches for it, the crescent
      end of one of Jet&#x27;s shuang gou pins it like an axe. Jet has the two
      weapons hook to hook; with a yank he pulls the sword and Aang&#x27;s glider to
      him.)

      Jet: You&#x27;re not going anywhere without your glider.

      (Jet swings the swords�still hook to hook�at Aang. Aang summersaults
      backwards to avoid the extra reach. Aang finishes his retreat in a nearby
      tree.)

      Aang: I&#x27;m not gonna fight you, Jet.

      Jet: You&#x27;ll have to if you want your glider back.

      (Aang retreats back into the forest, as Jet hooks the branch and pulls
      himself up. Katara follows on the ground. Jet attacks; Aang defends
      himself with balls of air, which Jet ducks. Jet attacks head on, but Aang
      blocks with his arms and sends his opponent flying into a tree trunk with
      an air kick. Jet combines his swords again and advances. Aang avoids the
      flail-like move and sends another air blast. Jet stoops down and lets the
      air flow over and past him, then lunges.

      They continue the chase through the many levels of the forest. Jet catches
      up to Aang and sends them both freefalling, attacking as they go. They
      both end up on a branch. Jet continues his attack. Aang avoids it all. Jet
      charges again, but Aang hits him with a jetstream of air. Jet falls. He
      recovers, but looses the glider in the process. Before Aang can get to the
      ground Jet kicks him into a trunk. He lands with a thud next to his
glider.
      A small tributary flows past him. Aang is slow to get up. Before Jet can
      take more than a step however, he his hit by a large water strike. Katara
      is there; she uses water from the river to throw Jet against the trunk of
      the tree. Over and over she attacks; Jet is unable to cut the water and
      its force plasters him against the trunk. She bends the water to ice; the
      soggy renegade is left frozen from toe to neck.)

      Katara: Why, Jet? I can&#x27;t believe I trusted you. You lied to me�you&#x27;re
      sick and I trusted you!

      (A signal call is heard. Katara and Aang are startled, then look to the
      valley beyond�where it&#x27;s coming from. Jet gives an answer call.)

      Katara (cont.): What are you doing?

      Jet: You&#x27;re too late.

      Katara (horrified): No!

      (Aang snaps open his glider and runs for the nearby cliff/waterfall. His
      glider&#x27;s wing is so shredded however, that he has no lift and slams back
      into the ground near the edge. Katara runs over to help him.)

      Aang: Sokka&#x27;s still out there�he&#x27;s our only chance.

      Katara: Come on, Sokka. I&#x27;m sorry I ever doubted you. Please.

      (Cut to a tree. Longshot stands on a branch, his bow pulled. He has a fire
      arrow on the string He sights, then lets it fly.

      It arcs down to the base of the dam.

      Katara watches.)

      Katara (whisper): No�

      (The center of the dam explodes in a cloud of smoke and fire. Katara and
      Aang watch a massive wall of water go over the �dry&#x27; falls and down to the
      town.

      Inside the town the streets are empty except for the occasional barrel and
      a market table with cabbages. The water rushes through the open gate, as a
      cresting wave dwarfs it. The wall and gate are swallowed as the wave
      strikes the town.

      The flotsam carried away includes a smiling doll in a purple dress.)

      Aang: Sokka didn&#x27;t make it in time.

      Katara: All those people�(She turns in rage back to Jet.) Jet�you monster!

      Jet: This was a victory, Katara. Remember that. The Fire Nation is gone
      and this valley will be safe.

      Sokka: It will be safe�without you.

      (In shock, Jet looks up to see Sokka, Appa and Momo rise from below the
      level of the cliff. Sokka has Appa&#x27;s reins.)

      Katara: Sokka!

      Sokka: I warned the villagers of your plan, just in time.

      Jet: What!

      Sokka: At first they didn&#x27;t believe me. The Fire Nation soldiers assumed I
      was a spy. But one man vouched for me�the old man you attacked. He urged
      them to trust me, and we got everyone out in time.

      (What Sokka describes is seen in monochrome pictures.

      The townsfolk are seen on high ground above the river, on the bank
      opposite the town. A LITTLE GIRL runs down to the water&#x27;s edge as the doll
      floats by. She retrieves it.)

      Little Girl (Happily): Missus Pretty! (She hugs her doll.)

      Jet: Sokka, you fool! We could&#x27;ve freed this valley!

      Sokka: Who would be free�everyone would be dead.

      Jet: You traitor!

      Sokka: No, Jet. You became the traitor when you stopped protecting
      innocent people.

      Jet: Katara. Please�help me.

      Katara: Goodbye Jet.

      (Sokka gives Appa&#x27;s reigns a flick.)

      Sokka: Yip yip.

      (Jet is left behind on the ground, still frozen to the tree.

      The sky they fly in is empty, save a few wispy clouds.)

      Aang: We thought you were going to the dam. How come you went to the town
      instead?

      Katara: Lemme guess�your instincts told you.

      Sokka: Hey�sometimes they&#x27;re right.

      Aang: Um�Sokka? You know we&#x27;re going the wrong way, right?

      (Sokka is surprised, but quickly recovers.)

      Sokka: �And sometimes they&#x27;re wrong. (With a grin, he pulls Appa&#x27;s reigns.
      They fly off screen, then reappear going in the opposite direction.)

      FADE OUT.

第十回
杰
模模 跑哪儿去了？
我来救你了，模模
好吧，也把你俩放了吧
别费事了，看我的
还真有你的
这是火宗的捕兽器，看看这金属锻造工艺就知道了
我们最好赶紧打包上路
这次咱们走陆路，不飞了
啥？为什么不飞了？
仔细想一想，为什么每次 祖寇 和火宗人总能发现我们
都是因为 阿柏，它太显眼了
啥？阿柏才不显眼呢
它可是个巨大的鼻涕兽，头上还有个箭头，
想看不到它都难
索卡是嫉妒你头上的箭头，
谁让它没有呢
我知道你们都想走空路，但是我的直觉告诉我
这次为了安全必须走陆路
-你什么时候变成头儿了？
-我不是什么头儿，我可是带头人
你是带头人？！
你都还没变声呢，怎么当带头人？
反正我是这里年纪最大的，还是个武士，
所以我有资格当带头人
带头人还得是 安昂 当，他可是降世神通
别开玩笑了，他还是个傻小子
他说的也没错啦
咱们为什么浪费时间谁当头的问题上
你这么专横，怪不得没有女孩可让你亲
-我亲过女孩，只不过你还没见到她而已
谁呀？你是说奶奶吗？奶奶我见过
当然不是奶奶了。我的直觉告诉我...
如果我们步行的话一定平安无事
带头人得相信自己的知觉
好吧，我们就步行试试
我们英明的带头人
没准步行还很有趣呢
步行烂透了，真明白那些没有
飞天野牛的人是怎么生活的
我也不知道啊，安昂。
问问 索卡的直觉吧，它可是无所不知啊
哈哈，你的笑话很好笑啊
-背着包简直累死我了
-也许你该找个人帮帮你，就找索卡的直觉帮忙吧
-好主意，索卡的直觉，能不能
-够了，够了
我知道你们很累，我也是
但只有这样
我们才可以避开...火国的军队
快跑！
-糟糕，没路走了
-索卡，你的衣服着了
如果你让我们通过，我们保证不伤害你们
你在干嘛？
虚张声势呗~
就你们，保证不伤害我们？
干的不错啊，索卡，
你怎么做到的？
靠直觉吧
看哪！
给我倒下吧你
树上有埋伏
嘿，我正要撂倒他呢
先到先得嘛~
拜托~
-嘿
-你好~
你们单枪匹马的就灭了整个军队
他们一共也就多个人嘛
我叫杰，来见见我的兄弟们，
他们都是无畏的战士
“冷笑”
“善射”
“臭虫”
“公爵”
“矮人”
“矮人”？
真是个有趣的名字
什么？你觉得我的名字好笑
是很好笑嘛~
杰，谢谢你救了我们
幸好你当时在那
我倒要谢谢你们呢
我们早上就在那里等待伏击那些士兵
只是一直在等待时机
直到你们闯了进来创造了良机
我们也只是凭着直觉行事
你们差点就送了小命啊
嘿，杰。这个桶里装满了爆破果冻呢
看来收获不小啊
这还有一整箱果冻糖呢
也不赖嘛
小心点，别把它们弄混了
我们把这些战利品搬回秘密基地吧
你们有自己的秘密基地
想见识见识吗?
当然了，带我们去看看吧
我们到了
到了？这里什么也没有啊
抓住它
为什么？这是什么东东？
安昂？
我自己就能上去
抓住我，卡塔拉
你这里真棒啊
这上面真美啊
是很美
更重要的是，火宗人不会发现我们在这上面
他们可是绞尽了脑汁要抓到你
我说的没错吧，杰
不会让他们得逞的，“臭虫”
火宗人干嘛要抓你？
可能是被我们给弄烦了吧
几年前
火宗侵占了这附近的一个土强国的村镇
我们埋伏袭击他们的军队
切断他们的供给
只要是能给他们捣乱的事我们都干
总有一天
我们会将火宗的人完全的赶出去
解放那里的人民
真实太英勇了
可不是嘛，还有谁比躲在树上人更英勇
不用理会我哥哥，他成烦人了
没关系
今天他可能太衰了，所以心烦
那么...你们住在这儿吗？
没错
那个叫“善射”男孩儿
他的家乡被火宗人烧毁了
我们和“公爵”不打不相识，当初他要投我们的食物
我想他也是个无家可归的孤儿
那你呢？
火宗人杀了我的父母
那时我才八岁
那天改变了我的人生
我和索卡的母亲也是被火宗人杀死的
我很遗憾，卡塔拉
今天
我们又一次打败了这群火宗猪
耶~~~
我还记得今天有个士兵的表情，太好笑了
当时，“公爵”正骑在他的脖子上，就像骑着个发疯的肥猪猴
耶~
这些火宗人还认为住在树上小毛孩儿们不足所畏
也许他们想的没错
真蠢哪！
也许他们是大错特错了
耶！
嘿，杰
说得好
谢了
对了
你和安昂真让我刮目相看啊
你们的御术真让我大开眼界啊
是吗，他是很棒的
他就是降世神通
我的功夫还拿不上台面
是降世神通啊
真不错啊
谢了，杰
你和安昂来帮我们怎么样
抱歉了，我们今晚就要离开
索卡，你不是开玩笑吧
我本来还想在明天交给你个重要任务呢
什么任务？
你在干嘛？
嘘，这能让我听到远方的声音
好办法啊
还没有动静
等等，有了...
有人过来了
一共有多少人？
我想只有一个
干的好，索卡，准备应战
等等
警报解除
来的是个老头
你来我们的森林干什么，你这个奸细
放过我吧，我只是路过的
你以摧毁城镇为乐吧
你以摧毁家庭为乐吧
我说的没错吧
求你了，让我走吧
求你手下留情啊
火宗人会随随便便放人吗？
火宗人有同情心吗？
杰，他只是个老头
他是个火宗人。搜搜他
但他也没有伤害任何人
你忘了吗？是火宗的人杀了你的母亲
记住你为何而战
杰，东西到手了
你这么做是不对的
这就是我们应该做的
走吧，离开这儿
快走，索卡
索卡，来看看“公爵”给了我什么
不玩了~
嘿，索卡
杰回来了吗？
没错，他是回来了
但是我们得走了
啥？
但是我刚给他做了这顶帽子
你的男朋友是个暴徒
你说什么？
他才不是呢
他简直是在乱来
他没有乱来
他只是选择了一种不同的生活方式
一种潇洒快乐的活法
他殴打抢劫手无缚鸡之力的老人
我要听听杰的解释
索卡，你告诉了他们发生了什么，
但是你没告诉他们他是个火宗人
他对那个只字未提
就算他是个火宗人，他也是个无害的平民百姓
索卡，他是个刺客
看见没
在刀把后面藏着毒药
他是被派来除掉我的
索卡，你可是救了我一命呢
我就知道杰不是那样的人
我可没看到什么刀
他当时把刀藏在了身上
明白了吧，索卡
你肯定是大意没看到
当时是没有刀
我走了，回去收拾我的东西
你们不是现在要走吧？
我非常需要你们的帮忙
我们能帮上什么忙吗？
火宗人想烧毁我们的森林
如果你们能用御水术填满水库，
我们就能用它来抵御大火
如果你们现在走的话
整个山谷就毁了
你现在不能走，火宗人要烧毁真个森林
抱歉，卡塔拉
他说得好像挺有道理的，但是我们不能相信他
你知道我怎们想吗？
无论之作为战士还是带头人，
他都比你优秀，所以你嫉妒他
卡塔拉，我可不嫉妒杰
只是我的直觉告诉...
但是我的直觉告诉我，
我们应该在这儿多留一阵帮助杰
走吧，安昂
对不起了，索卡
现在给我听好了
我给你们信号之后，你们再破坏大坝
只要一天水库不被破坏
火宗人就还会在这里作威作福
那些住在城里的人们该怎么办呢？
不把他们带到城外吗？
听我说，“公爵”，如果那么做的话我们会打草惊蛇的
没有我的信号，不准破坏大坝。记住了吗？
“马尾巴”，你想往哪跑啊？
索卡
很高兴你能加入我们
我听到你们要摧毁土强国村镇的计划了
我们的计划是要袭击火宗人所在的峡谷
那里可是有平民百姓啊，大人小孩都有
没有牺牲，怎么能获得胜利呢
你骗安昂和卡塔拉说有森林大火
那时因为他们不像你我一样
他们不知道战争需要什么
我知道
我知道你为了得到想要的东西不择手段
本来还指望你能开开窍呢
看来
你已经有了自己的主意了
不能放你去给卡塔拉和安昂去通风报信
把他给我带走
越远越好
你不能这么做
索卡，高兴点
今天，我们将大败火军
杰
我替索卡的行为向你道歉
没关系了
他已经向我道歉了
不是吧？
索卡道歉了
可不是嘛，我也很诧异
我想可能是你和他的谈话起了作用
我是跟他谈过
可能是你的话触动了他
不管怎样
他正和“矮人”和“臭虫”在前线执行侦察任务呢
真高兴他能冷静下来
有时候他真是太顽固了
好了，我们到了
地下的水汽不断的从这些孔道中溢出来
我需要你们的帮忙
我从未对我看不见的水用过御水术
我不知道...
卡塔拉
你能行的
那我呢？
这对于降世神通来说应该是小菜一碟
不错
做的好，这条河的下游就是水库
在弄几处泉水，水库就会很快被填满了
看，那边还有一处水汽孔道
好的
你们继续干
我去水库看看
干完活，我们就去那儿找你
这样吧
咱们最好在秘密基地会合
我看这些水应该足够了
我可不是想偷懒啊
咱们去水库找杰吧
不是说好了在秘密基地会合吗？
咱们不是提前完成任务了嘛
他见到我们一定会很高兴的
快点，往前走
杰就要淹了整个村镇，你们怎么能袖手旁观？
听着，索卡
杰是个优秀的带头人
他怎么说我们就怎么做，听他的准没错
如果这就是杰的领导才能
那他要学的还多着呢
嘿
你们在那上面也别闲着，好好练习一下打结的功夫吧
嘿，“臭虫”
你的那些荔枝果还吃吗？
他们在干嘛？
嘿，那些红色木桶不是那天从火宗那里劫来的吗？
他们要用爆破果冻来干什么？
他们不是要炸了大坝吧？
什么？
不会，那样会毁了整个村镇的
杰不会那么做的
我得阻止他
杰不会那么做的
我正要那么做
杰，你为什么要那么做？
卡塔拉
如果仔细考虑一下，
你们也会赞同我的
好好想想火宗人是怎么对待你的母亲的
我们不能再容忍他们在将暴行施加在其他人身上
你这么做是不对的
卡塔拉，我希望你能了解我
我原以为你的哥哥会了解，但是
你把索卡怎么了？
卡塔拉
我得去大坝那儿
看你没了滑翼还怎么去
杰，我不想和你打架
你要是想拿回滑翼就要跟我一战
你为什么要这么做，杰
我竟然相信了你
你跟我说谎
你这个无赖，我居然相信了你
你在干嘛？
你们太迟了
糟糕！
索卡还在那儿
我们只能靠他了
加油啊，索卡
抱歉，我竟然怀疑你
拜托了
不要啊
索卡没来得及制止它
可怜那些百姓...
杰，你是个混蛋
卡塔拉，这是个胜利
记住这一刻吧
火宗人走了，峡谷也就安全了
峡谷是会安全的...
只要没了你
索卡
我及时地告诉了村民们你的计划
你说什么？
起初他们并不相信我
火宗的士兵以为我是个奸细
但是有个人出来为我担保
他就是那天被你抢劫的老人
通过他的极力相劝，大家相信了我
我们及时地将每个人带出了村镇
我的漂漂小姐
索卡，你真是个白痴
我们本可以解放这个山谷的
哪里会被解放
恐怕大家都会死了吧
你这个叛徒
你错了，杰
在你放弃保护那些无辜的人的时候，
你已经成为了叛徒
卡塔拉
求你了
帮助我
别了，杰
驾，驾
我们原以为你去了大坝了呢
你怎么反而去了城镇了呢？
我猜...
肯定是你的直觉使然了
嘿，直觉有时候可是很准的啊
嗯，索卡
你知道咱们飞错方向了吧？
不过直觉有时也会犯糊涂
