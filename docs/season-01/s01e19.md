Act I

(Opening scene begins with an underwater shot in one of the Water Tribe
City canals. The camera pans up above the water line to reveal the canal
and the surrounding buildings. Cut to the plaza at the foot of the citadel
steps where Katara faced off with Master Pakku in �The Waterbending
Master.� The segmented ice columns that Katara toppled during the duel
have been repaired. It is morning and two waterbending students face off
against each other. Cut to the student on the left, a nervous looking
teenage boy whose left eye twitches slightly in anxiety. Cut to a close up
of the boy&#x27;s opponent � Katara. She looks very confident, a slight smile
on her face. Cut back to a longer shot of the boy who raises up a ball of
water, turns it to ice, and throws it at his opponent. Katara bends the
ice around her, liquefies it, and sends a huge stream of water back at the
boy who is washed up and backwards. As he is washed away, the water turns
to ice, imprisoning him about ten feet of the ground. Cut back to Katara
who relinquishes her waterbending stance while Pakku approached from over
her shoulder.)

Master Pakku: Nice try, Pupil Sangok. A couple of more years and you might
be ready to fight a sea sponge.

(Pupil Sangok continues to struggle against his bonds. Master Pakku turns
away, makes a motion with his left hand, and the ice prison melts,
dropping the hapless student to the ground. Cut to a wide that pans right
over the rest of the students who are sitting slumped on the ground. These
all appear to teenage boys.)

Master Pakku: Would anyone care for a rematch with Katara?

(They all shake their heads.)

Master Pakku: Katara, you have advanced more quickly than any student I
have ever trained. You have proven that with fierce determination, passion
and hard work you can accomplish anything. (Turning to look o.c.) Raw
talent alone is not enough.

(Cut to Aang lying on the ground, floating Momo around on an airball, a
lazy smile on his face.)

Master Pakku (voice over): Pupil Aang!

(Momo&#x27;s airball dissipates and Momo falls on Aang&#x27;s head.)

Aang: Yes, Master Pakku?
Master Pakku: Care to step into the sparring circle? I figure since you&#x27;ve
found time to play with house pets you must have already mastered
waterbending.

(Aang airbends himself to his feet.)

Aang: I wouldn&#x27;t say �mastered�, but check this out!

(Aang spins around, collecting snow around him as he goes. When he is
done, he has made himself into a snowman. Momo pounces on him and knocks
him down. Cut to Pakku and Katara who wear similar expressions of disdain.
Master Pakku shakes his head in disgust.

Fade to a frontal view of the city, then cut to a scene above one of the
city&#x27;s many canals. The shot pans down to reveal another bridge. Princess
Yue begins to speak from o.c. as she and Sokka enter the frame from the
left, Sokka walking on top of the bridge&#x27;s guard rail. In the background,
the song Iroh sung in �The Waterbending Master� plays slowly in the
background.)

Princess Yue: So they don&#x27;t have palaces in the Southern Tribe?
Sokka (stopping and sitting down on the rail): Are you kidding? I grew up
in a block of ice. It&#x27;s not exactly a cultural hub.

(Yue laughs with a warm smile, and puts her hand on Sokka&#x27;s shoulder.
After a moment she pulls back and looks at him seriously.)

Princess Yue: Sokka, this is wrong.
Sokka: What&#x27;s wrong? We&#x27;re taking a walk!
Princess Yue: I&#x27;m engaged. It just�feels�

(Sokka&#x27;s smile wanes as she begins to walk away, but the smile returns as
he gets an idea.)

Sokka: I know what you need! (He hops off the rail to stand by her side.)
You need to meet my good friend Appa!
Princess Yue: Who?

(Cut to an overhead shot of Sokka and Yue entering Appa&#x27;s pen. He is
eating from an enormous pile of greenery in front of him. Cut to a side
view of Sokka opening his arms to Appa, who is o.c. in front of him.)

Sokka: Appa and I go way back. Don&#x27;t we boy?

(The thunder of Appa&#x27;s shifting bulk is heard and Sokka&#x27;s features turn to
surprise. Appa enters from the left and pins him down with his forepaws).

Sokka: Ahh! Easy!

(Appa licks him from bottom to top � twice.)

Sokka: Down boy! Ahh! No! Up!
Princess Yue (laughingly): Looks like you haven&#x27;t been giving Appa enough
attention.

(Sokka struggles to try and free himself from Appa&#x27;s embrace. Cut to Sokka
and Yue in Appa&#x27;s saddle.)

Princess Yue: So how does this work?
Sokka: You hangin&#x27; on tight?
Princess Yue: Mmm hmm.
Sokka: Yip�(Cut to a close up of Sokka&#x27;s face)�yip!

(Appa soars into the nearly cloudless sky.)

Princess Yue: Oh�my�goodness!

(Cut to an overhead shot of the city and the waters outside the main city
gate. Appa flies effortlessly through the frame.)

Princess Yue: Wow! (Blushing slightly) I can&#x27;t believe you do this every
day!
Sokka (stretching): Yeh, we pretty much live up here.
Princess Yue (hugging herself): Is it always this cold in the sky?

(She snuggles up against Sokka.)

Sokka: Not when you&#x27;re with someone.

(Cut to a close of Yue looking at Sokka, her cheeks blushing.)

Princess Yue: It&#x27;s beautiful up here.
Sokka: Yeh.

(Pause while they look at each other with adoration. They come close to
kissing before they break off. The camera zooms out.)

Sokka: Whoo! Yeh! Good times! Good times!

(Around them, what looks like snowflakes begin to fall.)

Sokka (pointing down): Hey, look!

(Cut to a side view of Appa as he flies into a squall of these
�snowflakes�. Strangely, most of these �snowflakes� are black.)

Princess Yue: What&#x27;s happening?
Sokka (looking ahead o.c.): Oh no.

(The music becomes foreboding as the scene cuts to an overhead shot of the
city, where the black snow is now falling everywhere. Cut a view from
inside the city as citizens pause to regard the ash falling from the sky.
Cut to Aang laughing as he rolls around in a circle in the snow. Momo is
nearby. Within a few seconds ash starts to fall around him, but he doesn&#x27;t
notice. Momo sticks out his tongue, catches some ash and eats it. He spits
it out as Aang rolls back into the frame. Aang notices the ash and looks
up, Katara now visible in the background doing the same. Cut to a view of
Master Pakku and a few other city dwellers near a fountain looking up at
the ash. Scene shift again to a close up of a hand picking up some of the
ash on the ground.)

Sokka (voice over): Soot.

(Cut to a wide shot of Sokka kneeling on the ground, the ash and snow
still in his hand, Yue and Appa in the background.)

Princess Yue: What?
Sokka: I&#x27;ve seen it before. Right before my village was attacked. It&#x27;s
soot mixed with snow.

(Sokka stands.)

Princess Yue: But why?
Sokka: It&#x27;s the Fire Nation. They&#x27;ve closed in on the North Pole. And from
the looks of the stuff�

(Cut to a wide shot of Sokka and Yue looking over the ocean horizon, which
is darkened by a dense grey cloud.)

Sokka: �I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s a lot of them.

(Cut to a shot of the prows of three Fire Navy vessels cutting through the
waves.)

Zhao (voice over): This will truly be one for the history books, General
Iroh.

(Cut to Iroh and Zhao on the bridge of Zhao&#x27;s flagship.)

Zhao: Just think, centuries from now, people will study the great Admiral
Zhao who destroyed the last of the Water Tribe civilization. You&#x27;re lucky
you&#x27;re here to see it.
Iroh: Be careful what you wish for, Admiral. History is not always kind to
its subjects.
Zhao: I suppose you speak from experience? But rest assured, this will be
nothing like your legendary failure at Ba-Sing-Se.
Iroh: I hope not, for your sake.
Zhao: Tell the Captains to prepare for first strike.

(Iroh turns and walks away. Cut to a quick shot of the ornate prow of
Zhao&#x27;s ship cutting through the icy waters, then cut back to Iroh and
Zuko, still in his guard disguise, in a hallway on Zhao&#x27;s ship.)

Iroh (whispering): We&#x27;ll be landing soon. Do you have a plan?
Zuko (removing his mask): I&#x27;m working on it, Uncle.

(Zuko replaces his mask and they split up. Cut to a shot within the Water
City, as the feet of Water Tribe warriors run across the screen, then cut
to a shot of two Water Tribe men striking a gong with alternating strokes
on top of one of the city&#x27;s buildings. The gong has symbols representing
both the moon and the ocean on it. The scene shifts rapidly to show many
city dwellers running up the steps of the citadel, including (briefly)
Master Pakku and Sokka, Yue in tow. The Princess stops, bringing Sokka to
a halt along with her.)

Sokka: What&#x27;s wrong? (Pointing up to the citadel) We have to go!
Princess Yue (releasing his grip on her hand): No, Sokka, wait. I can&#x27;t
see you anymore. Not at all.
Sokka (turning in surprise): What? We&#x27;re just friends.
Princess Yue: I wish we could just be friends, but I like you too much and
it&#x27;s too confusing to be around you. I&#x27;m marrying someone else.
Sokka: You don&#x27;t love him, do you? You don&#x27;t even seem to like him.
Princess Yue: But I do love my people.
Sokka: You&#x27;re not marrying them.
Princess Yue: You don&#x27;t understand. I have duties to my father, to my
tribe. (Running off screen, basrely holding back tears) I have to do this,
goodbye!

(Cut to a close up of Sokka, looking distraught at Yue&#x27;s sudden departure.
The scene then shifts to a front shot of Chief Arnook beginning a speech
to a group of Water Tribe warriors. His voice echoes through the great
hall as he speaks. Behind him sit Princess Yue and Master Pakku. On the
floor, their backs to a nearby wall, sit Aang, Katara and Sokka.)

Chief Arnook: The day we have feared for so long has arrived. The Fire
Nation is on our doorstep. It is with great sadness I call my family here
before me, knowing well that some of these faces are about to vanish from
our tribe. But they will never vanish from our hearts. Now, as we approach
the battle for our existence, (he raises his arms up to the heavens in
supplication) I call upon the great spirits! Spirit of the Ocean! Spirit
of the Moon! Be with us! (Lowering his arms and continuing his address)
I&#x27;m going to need volunteers for a dangerous mission.
Sokka (standing up): Count me in.
Katara: Sokka!

(Many other men stand up in the crowd with him.)

Chief Arnook: Be warned. Many of you will not return. Come forward to
receive my mark if you accept the task.

(The men form a line in front of the Chief to receive his mark. It is
three red lines on the forehead, made from some paint or ink that the
Chief holds in a bowl in front of him. Sokka is the second in line. As
Sokka leaves, he turns and makes eye contact with Yue before he turns
again and walks away. Yue begins to cry silently as the string
instrumental from General Iroh&#x27;s song plays softly.

Fade to a shot of Aang sitting on one of the pylons at the top of the
citadel steps. He is looking out over the city walls to the ocean horizon
in the distance. Behind him the Chief approaches.)

Chief Arnook: The stillness before battle is unbearable. (Katara walks up
behind Aang to his left) Such a quite dread.
Aang: I wasn&#x27;t there when the Fire Nation attacked my people. (Cut to a
close up of Aang, a fierce expression on his face.) I&#x27;m gonna make a
difference this time.

(Cut to shot from behind Aang. He stands up on top of the pylon, Katara to
his left and the Chief to his right. The camera zooms up towards and into
the corona of the sun.

Shift to a frontal shot of the city from the water. All looks calm and
quiet on a beautiful sunny day. Cut to a slanted shot of a row of Water
Tribe warriors who line the top of the city wall, their faces painted for
war. The shot cuts to pan left across the wall, revealing a solid line of
warriors, with Aang atop Appa in the center. Katara and Sokka stand to
Appa&#x27;s left. Cut to a profile shot of Sokka, Katara and Aang in the
background, all looking out to sea with expressions of fierce
determination. In the distance a single ship is seen. It launches a
fireball which hurtles directly at the center of the city wall. It strikes
the water symbol in the center of wall and blows a massive hole through
it. Many defenders are blown backwards into the city by the concussion,
along with huge chunks of ice and debris. Cut to commercial break.)

Act II

(The shows returns to a shot of another fireball once flying through the
air towards the city. It lands in a canal with an explosion of smoke,
water and fire. Cut to a shot of the Fire Nation crew launching another
fireball from the trebuchet on the approaching ship&#x27;s foredeck. It strikes
the right side of the city wall, shattering a piece of it. Appa recoils
and roars as the smoke and exploding ice create havoc around him.)

Aang: Yip! Yip!

(Appa and Aang launch off the wall towards the Fire Navy ship while the
defenders on the wall try to reorganize. Cut to Sokka searching among the
wreckage of the ruined wall.)

Sokka: Katara!?

(He walks behind a large mound of snow which begins to move. A large chunk
of the snow mound blows out of the screen as Katara waterbends it away to
release herself. Sokka helps her to her feet just in time to see two more
fireballs come over the city wall.

Cut to Appa roaring in the sky, Aang at his reigns, a stern look on his
face. As Aang and Appa approach the Fire Navy ship it fires a few more
fireballs at them. The last Aang bats out of the with his staff. The blow
changes the trajectory of the fireball and it goes wild, harmlessly
striking the ice cliff way to the left of the city.

Cut back to Aang.)

Aang: I&#x27;ll take it from here, boy!

(Appa begins to invert himself allowing Aang to just fall of the saddle
into a free fall. Appa exits the frame as Aang continues his drop. After a
few seconds he opens his glider and closes in on the ship. Dodging several
more fireballs Aang arrives on the foredeck, breaking the rest of his fall
by using his staff as a helicopter blade. Once he lands, he whips up a
gale that blows much of the deck crew off the screen. Aang then hops up
onto the arm of the loaded trebuchet and begins to walk down it. A huge
Fire Nation soldier blocks his way, however, and he is forced back up the
arm. Two more soldiers have climbed the trebuchet, however, and appear
behind Aang. They all swing mighty hammers at him and miss, damaging the
trebuchet. Finally, Aang jets into the air and with a mighty blow blasts
the trebuchet into a dozen pieces.

Aang runs over to the other trebuchet on the deck. He breaks the chain the
stops the trebuchet arm from overextending and then fires the trebuchet.
The arm overextends and the weapon shoot its fireball into the deck,
straight through the forepeak and into the water below. Aang runs back up
the deck to two more trebuchet, Fire Nation guards in tow. He ties the
chains of two trebuchets together in a bow knot. He then runs over to one
of the machines firing mechanisms and kicks it into operation. The
activated trebuchet draws the one it is tied to across the deck towards
itself. When the one strikes the other they disintegrate into a pile of
useless junk.

Aang grins widely as he runs over to another trebuchet and is observed by
a large Fire Nation warrior. He about to strike the firing mechanism with
a hammer when he sees the warrior approach. Aang drops the hammer in fear,
narrowly avoiding multiple hammers attached to chains that attempt to
strike him from o.c. Cut to the warrior wielding the chained hammers as
weapons. Hiding behind one of the trebuchet&#x27;s girders, Aang is quickly
ensnared by two chains which rap around him. Cut to the warrior
controlling the chains. Appa&#x27;s feet suddenly swoop into the frame,
breaking the chain and sweeping the warrior out of the picture. Aang frees
himself from his now loose chains.)

Aang: Appa!

(Cut to Appa peering over the side of a ship. He ejects the chain warrior
overboard with a grunt and a shove of his paw. Aang runs over and jumps
onto Appa&#x27;s forehead, bear hugging him.)

Aang: Thanks for the rescue, buddy!

(Suddenly the ship starts to vibrate violently. A huge spear of ice breaks
through the foredeck straight into the sky. Cut to a view of the port side
hull which is now encased in rapidly expanding ice. The Fire Navy ship has
been surrounded by Water Tribe skiffs full of waterbenders. Together they
the Fire Navy ship out of the water on a bed of ice. Appa and Aang take
off the now heavily listing deck. As Aang and Appa rise above the now
wrecked ship, Aang&#x27;s expression turns to horror and surprise as he looks
in front of him. Cut to a view from behind Appa and Aang. The horizon is
full of Fire Navy ships as far as the eye can see.)

Aang: You have got to be kidding me.

(Cut to a quick shot of Water Tribe warriors walking up stairs, then to a
headshot of Chief Arnook once again addressing a group of soldiers.)

Chief Arnook: Men, you&#x27;ll be infiltrating the Fire Nation navy. That means
you&#x27;ll all need one of these uniforms�

(Cut to a shot of someone walking into an empty frame from the waist down
wearing what appears to be a Fire Navy uniform. The screen pans up to
reveal Hahn, an arrogant looking, dark haired young man. The uniform he
wears, while clearly of the Fire Nation, is not current standard issue. In
particular, the shoulder armor has wings that curve upward. Laughter from
o.c. is heard, then switch to a wide shot of the assembly to reveal that
it is Sokka who is laughing. He puts his hand over his mouth. The other
warriors turn to look at him.)

Hahn: What&#x27;s your problem?
Sokka (pointing at him): Fire Navy uniforms don&#x27;t look like that.
Hahn: Of course they do. These are real uniforms captured from actual Fire
Navy soldiers.
Sokka: When, like a hundred years ago?
Chief Arnook: Eighty five.
Sokka (walking forward): The Fire Nation doesn&#x27;t wear shoulder spikes
anymore. The newer uniforms are more streamlined.

(Sokka bends the tip of one of the shoulder spikes back with the tip of
his finger and lets get out. It bounces back to its original shape with a
little comic sound effect.)

Hahn (to Arnook): How do we know we can trust this guy? (To Sokka, leaning
into him with a threatening expression) Such bold talk for a new recruit.
Chief Arnook: Sokka is from our sister tribe, Hahn, he is a capable
warrior and I value his input.

(The camera zooms backward from Arnook to show Sokka looking smugly at
Hahn, who is none too pleased. Cut to a profile shot of the assembly as
Arnook turns back to finish his address.)

Chief Arnook: Now, our first objective is to determine the identity of
their commanding officer.
Sokka: His name is Zhao. Middle-aged. Big sideburns. Bigger temper.
Chief Arnook: Sokka, I want you to tell everything you know to Hahn, he is
leading this mission. Hahn, show Sokka your respect. I expect nothing less
from my future son-in-law.

(Arnook exits left as Hahn pushes his hair back over his ears. The screen
pans right to reveal that Sokka&#x27;s jaw has dropped in shock at the Chief&#x27;s
last pronouncement. He recovers and points an accusing finger at hahn.)

Sokka: Princess Yue&#x27;s marrying you?
Hahn: Yeh, what of it?
Sokka (turning away): Nothing, congratulations.

(Cut to a late afternoon or sunset shot of the advancing ranks of Fire
Navy ships firing volleys of fireballs towards the city. Some land inside
the city and some hit the outer wall. Cut to Master Pakku in front of a
group of waterbenders.)

Master Pakku: Stop those fireballs!

(As a fireball bears down on them, they collectively raise up a barrier of
water and freeze as the fireball impacts. It is extinguished. Cut to a
view of Zhao&#x27;s back as he watches the bombardment from the bridge of his
flagship. Iroh enters the frame.)

Iroh: It&#x27;s almost twilight, Admiral. As your military consultant I must
advise you to halt your attack. The waterbenders draw their power from the
moon and it is nearly full tonight. You should wait and resume the attack
at daybreak.
Zhao: Oh, I&#x27;m well aware of the moon problem and I am working on a
solution. But for now, daybreak it is.

(Cut to a shot of the front rank of Fire Navy ships dropping anchors for
the night, then to an overhead of the fleet parked outside the Water
City&#x27;s main wall. Zhao&#x27;s ship is in the second line of ships and looks
double the size of the others. Shift to a shot from behind Katara and Yue,
who are standing in front of the citadel looking out over the city and its
walls to the line of threatening Fire Navy ships. Plumes of smoke rise
over several sections of the city that have been bombed.)

Princess Yue: They&#x27;ve stopped firing.

(Appa swoops into the frame.)

Katara (pointing at them): Aang!

(Appa lands on the plaza at the base of the Citadel steps. Yue and Katara
run down to them. As Appa lands he lies down on his belly, his feet too
tired to keep him up. Aang looks small and dejected in the saddle. He
slides off and comes to rest next to Appa&#x27;s left forepaw.)

Aang: I can&#x27;t do it. (Putting his hands to his head.) I can&#x27;t do it.
Katara: What happened?
Aang: I must have taken out a dozen Fire Navy ships, but there&#x27;s just too
many of them. I can&#x27;t fight them all.
Princess Yue: But, you have to! You&#x27;re the Avatar!
Aang: I&#x27;m just one kid.

(He buries his head in his arms in despair as Katara sits down to comfort
him.

Cut to a shot of the nearly full moon as the screen pans down to reveal
Zhao&#x27;s command ship, then cut again to Zuko, now out of uniform entirely
dressed instead in plain grey clothes, preparing a canoe to be lowered
into the water. Behind him a door opens to reveal Iroh entering. He shuts
the door behind him.)

Iroh: If you&#x27;re fishing for an octopus, my nephew, you need a tightly
woven net or he will squeeze through the tiniest hole and escape.
Zuko: I don&#x27;t need your wisdom right now, Uncle.
Iroh: I&#x27;m sorry, I just nag you because, well, ever since I lost my son�

(Iroh looks away, pain evident on his face. The camera focuses on Zuko in
the foreground, whose image had been fuzzy as Iroh spoke.)

Zuko: Uncle, you don&#x27;t have to say it.
Iroh: I think of you as my own.

(Zuko turns to him, a genuine look of concern and understanding on his
face.)

Zuko: I know, Uncle. (He bows and salutes him with his arm over chest.)
We&#x27;ll meet again�

(Iroh rushes forward and gives him a bear hug.)

Zuko (releasing his Uncle and walking over to the canoe): �after I have
the Avatar.

(He gets into the canoe and begins to lower it to the water.)

Iroh: Remember your Breathe of Fire! It could save your life out there!
Zuko: I will.
Iroh: And put your hood up, keep your ears warm!
Zuko (now far below his uncle): I&#x27;ll be fine.

(Cut to a shot of Iroh looking worried as he watches his nephew depart,
then a wide shot of the city and the line of Fire Navy ships between Zuko
and his goal.

This scene is replaced by a shot of a close up of Sokka&#x27;s hands sharpening
an axe blade on a rotating wheel. It is clear he is applying too much
pressure to the blade for some reason causing speaks to fly off the blade.
Cut to a wider shot of Sokka and Hahn performing the same task side by
side. No sparks fly from Hahn&#x27;s blade. Sokka&#x27;s expression is clearly
unhappy.)

Hahn (mispronouncing Sokka&#x27;s name): Let me tell ya, Soka, I&#x27;ve courted a
lot of girls, but Yue is the finest � and she comes with the most perks.
Sokka (his eyes bulging in anger): Perks!? What does that mean?
Hahn: I mean, Yue&#x27;s nice and everything, but the points I&#x27;ll get with the
Chief aren&#x27;t bad either.
Sokka: Princess Yue is wasted on a self absorbed weasel like you!
Hahn: Whoa. Hang on. What do you care? You&#x27;re just a simple rube from the
Southern Tribe. What would you know of the political complexities of our
life? No offense.

(Sokka yells in anger and tackles Hahn to the ground. Sokka ends up on top
and punches Hahn in the face.)

Sokka: You&#x27;re just a jerk without a soul! No offense!

(They roll around a bit more before Chief Arnook&#x27;s hands appear in the
frame to break them up.)

Chief Arnook: That&#x27;s enough! Sokka, you&#x27;re off the mission.

(The Chief exits again as Sokka looks away, humiliated.)

Hahn (to the assembled soldiers): All right, fall in men! Everybody listen
to what I say and we&#x27;ll take out this Admiral Jo in no time.
Sokka (to the backs of Hahn and his departing soldiers): It&#x27;s Admiral
Zhao!

(Cut to a night shot of Zuko navigating his canoe through the ice flows
near the City. He is wrapped up in his grey garb. Nearby, turtle seals can
be heard making noise. He floats silently near the damaged city wall,
unseen by the sentries patrolling atop the damaged barrier. He beaches the
craft on the ice near the wall and spies several turtle seals disappearing
into a hole in the ice.)

Zuko: Where are they going? They&#x27;re coming up for air somewhere�

(He takes off his veil, takes a deep breath and plunges into the icy
water.

Cut to a view of the nearly full moon.)

Princess Yue (voice over): The legends say the moon was the first
waterbender. (The camera view zooms backward to reveal Katara, Aang and
Yue looking at the moon over the city from a room in the citadel. Aang&#x27;s
holds his head low.) Our ancestors saw how it pushed and pulled the tides
and learned how to do it themselves.
Katara: I&#x27;ve always noticed my waterbending is stronger at night.
Princess Yue: Our strength comes from the Spirit of the Moon, our life
comes from the Spirit of the Ocean. They work together to keep balance.
Aang (his eyes opening wide as he gets an idea): The Spirits! Maybe I can
find them and get their help!
Princess Yue: How can you do that?
Katara: The Avatar is the bridge between our world and the Spirit World.
Aang can talk to them!
Princess Yue (smiling hopefully): Maybe they&#x27;ll give you the wisdom to win
this battle!
Aang (spreading his arms wide): Or, maybe they&#x27;ll unleash a crazy amazing
spirit attack on the Fire Nation!

(Cut to a wide shot of the three, as Yue and Katara regard Aang steadily.
Aang puts his arms behind his back and smiles.)

Aang: Or wisdom. That&#x27;s good too.
Katara: The only problem is, last time you got to the Spirit World by
accident. How are you going to get there this time?
Princess Yue: I have an idea, follow me.

(Princess Yue walks into the camera. Cut to a view of the three walking
through a courtyard behind the citadel. Yue stops in front of a wooden
half height door.)

Aang: So is this the way to the Spirit World?
Princess Yue (laughing): No, you&#x27;ll have to get there on your own.
(Opening the door) But I can take you to the most spiritual place in the
entire North Pole.

(Aang enters as Momo jumps off his shoulder and onto Katara. Cut to Aang&#x27;s
p.o.v. Inside there is a long pool of water. At the back of the chamber is
a waterfall coming from the glacier way above. On the sides of the pool
are two ledges by which one can access the landing at the back of the
chamber. The landing is filled with green foliage, another smaller pool
that looks almost tropical in nature, and a small t shaped gate like
structure very much akin to a Chinese paifang or perhaps a Japanese torii.
The landing is connected to the ledges on the side of the chamber by two
wooden foot bridges. Cut to a zoom in close up of Aang&#x27;s face, filled with
wonder at the nature beauty before him before cut to commercial break.)

Act III

(The show returns to a shot of Aang running over the left bridge,
laughing. He lands on the soft grass in front of the little pond. He rubs
it fondly.)

Aang: I never thought I&#x27;d miss grass this much!

(He flops over on his back as Yue and Katara walk onto the landing
themselves.)

Katara (smiling): It&#x27;s so warm here! How is that possible? (She takes off
her overcoat.)
Princess Yue: It&#x27;s the center of all spiritual energy in our land.

(Cut to an overhead shot of the pond where two fish circle each other in a
timeless motion. One is white, the other black. Momo skitters up to the
pond and begins to try and grab the fish. Yue and Katara look severely at
Momo, who decides to run away.)

Aang: You&#x27;re right, Yue. I can feel�something�it&#x27;s so�tranquil.

(Aang sits cross legged in front of the pond. He closes his eyes, makes
two fists and puts his knuckles together in an attempt to meditate. Fade
to white, then cut to a dark cave filled with the sounds of turtle seals.
Another water hole is seen, its surface quickly broken by an out of breath
Prince Zuko. He flops onto the ice floor of the cave, his breath making
clouds of water vapor in front of him. He flips over, shiver, and blows
fire into his hands to warm him up. He gets up.)

Zuko (to the noisy turtles): Be quiet!

(They stop barking as he walks by, but begin once he passes. Zuko
approaches a waterfall at the back of the cave. He enters the tunnel where
the water is coming out. Screen fades to white as he makes headway up the
tunnel. Cut to Sokka sharpening his boomerang in the same armory he had
the fight with Hahn. Arnook comes up behind him.)

Chief Arnook: Is something wrong, Sokka?
Sokka: Oh no! Hahn&#x27;s out there on the top secret mission while I&#x27;m here
sharpening my boomerang. Everything&#x27;s fine!
Chief Arnook: Listen to me. I took you off the mission for selfish
reasons. I have a special task in mind for you.
Sokka (turning to the Chief in anger): What? You want me to scrub the
barracks?
Chief Arnook: I want you to guard my daughter, Princess Yue.
Sokka (getting up, an look of innocence mingled with desire on his face):
Er, sure. That shouldn&#x27;t be too hard.

(Arnook exits, fade to white. Cut back to Zuko forcing himself up the
tunnel. He slips once, but keeps on moving. Finally he exits the tunnel
into the bottom of a large pool of water. He swims up and breaks the
surface, gasping for air. The top of the chamber is inches above his head.
He regains his breathe, then looks just underneath the water line to scan
for exits. He sees one, dives and enters another tunnel. Going around one
bend and then up reveals what looks like an exit into open air, but when
he reaches it, it proves to be just thinner, lighter colored ice. Running
out of breath, he concentrates and superheats his hands to red hot and
places them on the thin ice. He burns through it and emerges into an ice
tunnel within the Water Tribe City. He lies down for a moment to regain
his strength.

Cut to Aang still in his meditation pose beside the pool, Katara and Yue
behind him. The camera slowly zooms in on Aang.)

Princess Yue (trying to whisper): Why is he sitting like that?
Katara (also whispering): He&#x27;s meditating � trying to cross over into the
Spirit World. It takes all his concentration.

(Aang cracks an eye at this continued interruption.)

Princess Yue: Is there any way we can help?

(The camera zooms back out to its original position.)

Aang: How �bout some quiet!? (Turning to look at them, Katara putting a
hand over her mouth.) C&#x27;mon guys! I can hear every word you&#x27;re saying!

(He resumes his pose. Cut to an overhead shot of Aang, the black and white
fish circling each other in front of him. The view switches from
underneath the fish. Aang stares at them. As he looks at them they blur
into the Yin � Yang symbol. His eyes and then a second later the screen
flashes white. When the view returns, Aang&#x27;s eyes and head arrow glow
white.)

Princess Yue: Is he okay?
Katara: He&#x27;s crossing into the Spirit World. He&#x27;ll be fine as long as we
don&#x27;t move his body. That&#x27;s his way back to the physical world.
Princess Yue (beginning to walk away): Maybe we should get some help?
Katara: No, he&#x27;s my friend. I&#x27;m perfectly capable of protecting him.
Zuko (voice over, his voice echoing slightly in the chamber): Well, aren&#x27;t
you a big girl now?
Katara (turning to the voice): No!

(Cut to Zuko walking over the footbridge towards them.)

Zuko: Yes! Hand him over, and I won&#x27;t have to hurt you.

(Cut to Katara assuming a waterbending stance, while Yue runs off in the
background. Aang, oblivious, still communes with the Spirit World in front
of the pond.

Zuko launches forward, firing several blasts of fire. Katara blocks all
three with water from the pond. He fires several more as he advances, but
on the last one she uses enough water to not only douse his fire, but hurl
him backward and lay him flat on the ground.)

Zuko (getting up): I see you&#x27;ve learned a new trick. But I didn&#x27;t come
this far to lose to you.

(He fires another blast which she blocks. Katara then launches another
stream of water at him, hurling him backwards again. He barely retains his
balance, but Katara freezes the water beneath him. His feet are frozen in
the ice. Then, with a massive output of effort, Katara raises a churning
sphere of water from the main pool behind Zuko, encases him in it, and
freezes him entirely. Cut to an accent close up of Katara&#x27;s face �
satisfaction written all over it. Cut back to Zuko in the ice.)

Zuko (voice muffled by the ice): You little peasant. You&#x27;ve found a
master, haven&#x27;t you?

(As Zuko ends his comment, the ground begins to shake and the ice begins
to glow yellow and orange. With an explosion of fire, the shell of ice
shatters, releasing Zuko who promptly charges Katara. They trade shots
which miss. Zuko gets behind Katara and almost grabs Aang&#x27;s collar, but
Katara blasts him out of the way with a jet of water. He gets blown over
to the right ledge. While he tries to recover, Katara raises a huge wave
of water that raises him to ten or more feet up the wall. She freezes him
in place once again.

Cut to a close up of Master Pakku. The sun rises over the horizon,
lighting his face. Cut to a shot from behind him and two of his
waterbenders. They look out from the citadel over the city wall to the
Fire Navy fleet. Cut to a shot from behind Zhao.)

Zhao: It&#x27;s daybreak at last. Let&#x27;s write history.

(A close up of Zhao&#x27;s face is replaced by a shot of Zuko still frozen in
the ice. His head droops in defeat. As the sunlight reaches him, though,
his head snaps up with a look of determination. He breathes steam, melting
the ice holding him in place. He slides down and charges Katara again. He
fires a huge blast of fire. Katara, caught off guard while she walking
back to Aang, blocks it only partially. She is thrown back into the post
of the paifang gate and is knocked out. When the smoke clears, Zuko looks
over her, his hand on Aang&#x27;s collar, the sun shining bright in the
background.)

Zuko: You rise with the moon. I rise with the sun.

(Cut to the prow of a Fire Navy ship dropping its bowsprit and using it to
slice open the Water City&#x27;s main wall. The bowsprit is then used as a
bridge by Fire Nation troops entering the city, much as the ancient Roman
corvus was used. Cut to a close up of Zhao&#x27;s eyes.)

Zhao: The Water Tribe can try to resist the inevitable (cut to a wider
shot of him and Iroh), but their city will fall today.

(Cut back to Katara, emerging from her involuntary nap. Here eyes open
suddenly, and she gets to her knees with a start. Cut to an overhead shot
of her and the pond. Aang and Zuko are gone. Momo chitters and runs across
the screen.)

Katara (shouting): Aang!

(Cut to side, wide shot of the sanctuary. Appa lands, Sokka and Yue in the
saddle. They move to hop down.)

Sokka: What happened? Where&#x27;s Zuko?
Katara (sadly): He took Aang. He took him right out from under me.
Sokka (voice over as we see a shot of Momo looking back at them from his
perch on the side of the pond): Where did they go?

(The shot pans up and out of the protected valley of the sanctuary to the
surface of the massive glacier above. Up there it is snowing hard. Zuko
struggles through the storm, carrying Aang, whose marking still glow
white. The disappear into the snow, fade to white.)

第十九回
北极之战
上部

不错嘛，桑阔
用不了多少年你就可以和海绵决斗了
还有人想和卡塔拉再比试一下吗？
卡塔拉，你的武艺精进的很快嘛，
比我所调教的任何学生都要强
你的决心、热情和刻苦让人印象深刻
你可以完成任何你想做的事情
你向我们证明了，只是天资聪颖是远远不够的
我说安昂
在，帕库大师
不来和卡塔拉比划比划吗？
看你都闲得和宠物玩上了
想必你的御水术已经掌握的差不多了吧
还不敢说我已经完全掌握了
不过请您看看我的新招
这么说南极水族没有宫殿喽？
别开玩笑了，我可是在冰窟窿里长大的，
你见过有那样的文化中心吗？
索卡，咱们不该这样
怎么了？
咱们只是在散步而已嘛
我已经订婚了
这种感觉怪怪的...
我知道什么能让你开心起来了
你应该去见见我的朋友阿柏
见谁？
阿柏和我老铁了，对吧
啊！你别激动啊
伙计，坐下！啊！
说错了，站起来
看来你和阿柏的沟通还不够啊
接下来该怎么做呢？
你抓紧了吗？
驾...驾...
噢，我的天哪
哇哦，你们每天都这样飞行吗？
没错，有时候干脆就住在上面
这上面一直这么冷吗？
有你相伴哪会觉得冷呢？
这上面风景真好啊
是啊
哇，哇哦
好时节啊，真是好时节
嘿，看哪
怎么了？
噢，不好
是煤烟
你说什么？
在我们村落遭到攻击之前
我曾见过这种景象
就是这种雪中夹杂着煤烟的景象
这是怎么回事呢？
肯定是火宗的人来了
他们已经逼近北极了
从这煤烟雪的程度来看
烈火国这回一定派了大军来犯
艾洛将军，这一刻将被载入史册
想想看
几百年后，人们都会在史书中读到：伟大的赵上校...
...是他一手摧毁了最后的水族文明
能够一同鉴证这个历史时刻，你应该感到幸运
上校，你所期愿的未必会实现啊
有时候偏偏天不如人愿啊
莫非您是有感而发？
放心了，这次绝对不会重蹈你惨败于永固城的覆辙的
但愿不会吧
传令给船长，准备发起首攻
我们就要登陆了
想好主意了吗
皇叔，我正在想呢
怎么了？
我们得赶紧走
等等，索卡，这样不行
我不能再见你了
再也不见了
啥？我们只是朋友而已嘛
我也希望我们只是朋友而已
可我真的是太喜欢你了，
你在身边让我进退两难
我就要嫁给别人了
可你并不爱他，不是吗？
你甚至都不见得喜欢他
但是我爱我的子民们
可你又不是要嫁给你的子民
你不了解
我有我的职责，
不能辜负我的父亲，辜负我的部落
我必须这么做
再见了
我们一直惧怕的一天终于到来了
火宗的军队已经兵临城下了
我怀着无比沉痛的心情将大家召集至此
要知道...
...大战之后，一些熟悉的面孔我们将再也无法看到了
但是他们将会永远留在我们的心上
现在，我们要为我们的生存而战
我祈求上天诸神
海之神
月之神
请庇佑我们吧
有谁志愿接受这个危险的任务
算我一个
索卡
考虑清楚
壮士一去兮，不回还
如果仍然愿意接受任务，请上前一步接受“战符”
战争前的静寂真是难熬啊
真是静得可怕
当年火宗人攻击我的族人时，我没能保护他们
这一次我要留下来，保护这些人民
驾，驾
卡塔拉
伙计，该本大爷上场了
阿柏
伙计，多谢你救了我
不是吧，搞什么搞
诸位，将派你们混入火宗的海军
所以,你们必须穿上这样的火宗制服
你笑嘛啊？
火宗的制服可不是这个样子
不是这样是啥样
这些衣服可是从被我们抓获的火宗士兵身上拔下来的
那是哪年的老皇历了？oo年前？
-年前
-火宗的制服早就不用这种带钩的护肩了
新的制服都体现了一种流线形的理念
我们凭什么要相信他
小兵豆子口气倒是不小
韩，索卡来自我们的兄弟部落
他可是一个值得信赖的武士，我很看好他哟
现在，我们的首要任务是要确认一下敌军统帅的身份
他的名字叫赵
中年人
鬓角很长
脾气也不小
索卡，请把你知道的所有情况都告诉给韩
他是这个任务的指挥
韩，你要尊重索卡
你可是我的东床快婿，别让我失望哦
月公主要嫁的人是你？
没错，怎么了？
没啥，恭喜恭喜啊
截住那些火球
上校，天就快黑了
作为你的战争顾问，我建议您停止进攻
御水师们会从月亮那儿吸收能量，
而今晚月亮将接近满月
应该等到破晓后再恢复进攻
不错，我知道月亮的确是个大麻烦，
我也正在考虑对付它的办法，
在没有对策之前还是破晓以后再说吧
他们停止进攻了
安昂
我做不到，我做不到
怎么了？
我已经解决掉至少一打的火宗战船了
不过他们的数量实在是太多了
我实在是力不从心啊
你一定能行的
你可是降世神通啊
我只是个小孩而已
皇侄啊，如果你要捕只章鱼的话
你的网必须织的很密，
哪怕是小小的一道口子也会让它跑掉的
皇叔，我现在没空听您说教
对不起啊，自从我的儿子死去之后，
我就不停的对你絮叨...
皇叔，您用不着道歉的
我一直都当你是我的亲生儿子
我知道，皇叔，我们会再见的
我会抓到降世神通的
记住御火时的气息，关键时会救你一命的
我记住了
还有，记得把头巾戴上，别把耳朵冻着了
放心吧
索卡，跟你这么说吧
在我泡过的那些小妞中，
月的脸蛋是最漂亮的，能赚得油水也是最多的
“油水”，你是什么意思？
我是说，月漂亮人又好
而且还能借机攀上族长这个高枝
让月公主嫁给你这么一个白眼狼真是白瞎了
（weasel 鼬鼠，狡猾的人）
喔，你这是干嘛啊
你干嘛这么上心啊
你不过是个南方部落的乡巴佬而已
哪里会懂我们这儿政治的复杂性呢？
我可是无意冒犯哦
你简直就是个没有灵魂的混蛋，我也无意冒犯
够了
索卡，这个任务不需要你了
好了，列队
只要按我的指挥行事，搬倒那个乔上校指日可待
是赵上校
他们是要哪了？
怎么没见它们上来换气
传说月亮就是第一个御水师
先人们亲眼目睹她是如何控制潮汐的
慢慢的也学会了这个本领
难怪我总觉得我的御水术在夜晚时最强
是月之神赐予我们力量
而海之神给予了我们生命
他们相辅相生，协调化一
你是说神灵
也许我可以找到他们，求他们帮助我们
那你要怎么做呢？
降世神通可是连接凡间和灵界的桥梁呢
安昂可以和他们交流
也许他们会启示你该如何赢得这场战争
也许他们会放个疯狂的灵兽出来去袭击烈火国呢
如果只有个启示也不错
不过，你当初进入灵界也只是误打误撞而已
你这回该怎样进去呢？
我有主意了
跟我来
这条路是通往灵界的吗？
不是，你得只身前往灵界
但是我可以带你去整个北极灵气最强的地方
我从没想过我会这么想念草地啊
这里好暖和啊
真是不可思议啊
这是我们这里灵气的中心
月，你说的没错
我能感到...一些东西...它是如此的....宁静
别出声
索卡，出什么事了吗？
哪儿会有什么事
韩出去执行他的超级秘密任务去了
而我却只能在这里磨我的“飞去来去”
韩出去执行他的超级秘密任务去了
而我却只能在这里磨我的“飞去来去”
真是太棒了
听我说
让你离开那个任务是出于我个人的原因
我有一个特别的任务要交给你
干什么？不是让我去打扫兵营吧？
我想你去保护我的女儿，月公主
嗯，那没问题，交给我了
他为什么那么坐着？
他正在打坐...
...他正试图跨入灵界
那他一定要全神贯注喽
咱们能不能帮他做点事?
你们就不能静一静吗？
拜托了，你们说的话我听得一清二楚
他没事吧？
他正在跨越灵界
只要我们不碰他的身体，他就会没事的
这样他就能找到回到凡间的路了
是不是该找人来帮忙？
不用
他是我的朋友
我完全可以保护好他的
哟，几天不见都成大姑娘了
不是吧
就是我
把他交出来，我不会伤害你们的
看来你的功夫大有长进啊
这么费劲才到这里，我可不想输
小样的，看来你拜了个师傅来教你
终于到了破晓时分了
让我们书写历史吧
你们从月亮汲取力量
而太阳则是我力量的源泉
水宗继续你们无谓的抵抗吧
今日此城必破
安昂
发生什么事了？
祖寇跑哪儿去了？
他带走了安昂，从我手中把他带走了
他们会去哪呢？
-=未完待续=-

水善国
土强国
火烈国
气和国
很久以前，这四大国和谐共处
然而，烈火国发起的战争结束了和平
只有同时掌握四种元素的降世神通才能结束战争
然而在大家最需要他的时候，他却消失了
年后，我和哥哥发现了转世的降世神通，
他是个御气师，名叫“安昂”
尽管他的御气术着实厉害
在拯救苍生之前，他要学的还有很多
但是我坚信
安昂 能拯救这个世界
