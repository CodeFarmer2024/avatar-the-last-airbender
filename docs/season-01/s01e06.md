      Scene I

      (The scene opens with a view of a forest canopy. The camera pans down to
      reveal Aang and Katara sitting on a natural stone patio. A noisy little
      stream exits the ground from underneath the stone ledge. Katara is folding
      her sleeping bag while Aang lies back in the exposed roots of an
      overturned tree. Cut to a view from behind Katara to see Sokka walking up
      the stream path. He is holding a sack.)

      Aang: Great, you&#x27;re back! What&#x27;s for dinner?
      Sokka: We&#x27;ve got a few options. First, round nuts and some kind of oval
      shaped nuts, and some rock shaped nuts that� might just be rocks. Dig in!

      (Sokka throws one of the nuts that might be a rock over his shoulder. It
      lands near Momo. Aang and Katara look at each other then back at Sokka.)

      Katara: Seriously, what else ya got?

      (Sokka peers with one eye into the bag, hoping to find something else. Cut
      to Momo, eyeing the nut like object with suspicion. He chitters and picks
      it up. He taps it on a nearby stone to no effect. The he cocks back and
      raps it hard on the stone. At that moment, a huge, startling noise
      disrupts the forest&#x27;s calm. Cut to a wide shot of the ledge and a clearing
      to the right where Appa was resting. The group and Appa look up at the
      noise.)

      Sokka: What was that!?

      (Cut to Momo looking befuddled over at Sokka. He turns to look back at the
      nut like object in his hand. He blinks twice to a cute effect. He drops
      the nut onto the stone and another huge sound echoes through the forest,
      startling Momo again. He jumps out of the frame. Cut to another wide shot.
      The three are looking left o.c. to where Aang points.)

      Aang: It&#x27;s coming from over there!

      (Aang and Katara rush off in the direction of the noise, leaving Sokka
      waving his arms at them.)

      Sokka: Shouldn&#x27;t we run away from huge booms � not toward them?

      (Cut to a view of a fallen tree, behind which Aang and Katara appear,
      followed closely by Sokka. The p.o.v then switches to behind them, where
      we can see that they are looking down a river bed. The river has been
      reduced to a small stream. A young earthbender is practicing his art in
      the river bed, and the three watch him move around a huge boulder. Cut
      back to a close up of the three.)

      Katara: An earthbender!
      Aang: Let&#x27;s go meet him!
      Sokka: He looks dangerous, so we better approach cautiously.

      (Cut instantly to Katara who has clearly ignored her brother&#x27;s warning by
      running way out into the river bed to address the young earthbender.)

      Katara: Hello there, I&#x27;m Katara! What&#x27;s your name?

      (The young earthbender looks over at Katara in surprise, drops his rock
      and runs back down the river bed. As he runs, he earthbends a load of rock
      into the riverbed, blocking pursuit.)

      Aang: Nice to meet you!
      Katara: We just wanted to say �hi�.
      Aang: Hey, that guy&#x27;s gotta be running somewhere, maybe we&#x27;re near a
      village and I bet that village has a market!
      Katara (excited): Which means no nuts for dinner! (Aang and Katara run
      o.c.)
      Sokka: Hey! I worked hard to get those nuts! (Momo flies off-screen to
      join the others, Sokka looks downcast) Yeh, I hate&#x27;em too.

      (Cut to a few overhead shots of a walled Earth Kingdom village in a steep
      valley. Cut to Aang, Katara and Sokka in a market. Aang is at a stall
      trying out a hat.)

      Aang: Great hat. I&#x27;ll trade you some nuts for it.

      (Aang turns to Sokka with the hat on and laughs. Meanwhile, Katara has
      noticed the young earthbender from the river bed enter a nearby building.)

      Katara: Hey!

      (Katara runs off-screen in pursuit. Cut to the young earthbender in a
      long, mostly empty room with an older woman, his mother.)

      Haru: Hi, mom.
      Mother: Where have you been, Haru? You&#x27;re late! Get started on your
chores.

      (Katara opens door and enters, framed in sunlight pouring in behind her.)

      Katara: Hey, you&#x27;re that kid! Why did you run away before?
      Haru: Uh, you must have me confused with some other kid.

      (Aang and Sokka enter.)

      Aang: No she doesn&#x27;t, we saw you earthbending.

      (Cut to an exterior shot of the building where the door closes and the
      windows get shut.)

      Mother (hands still on the window she just closed): They saw you doing
      what?
      Haru: They&#x27;re crazy, mom, I mean, look at how they&#x27;re dressed!

      (All three look at their clothing.)

      Mother: You know how dangerous that is! You know what would happen if they
      caught you earthbending!

      (From outside a heavy knock on the door is heard and Sokka quickly parts
      the window blinds to identify the intruders.)

      Soldier (from o.c.): Open up!
      Sokka: Fire Nation! Act natural!

      (Haru&#x27;s mother opens the door and a Fire Nation soldier enters. Cut to a
      view of the others caught freeze-frame in the midst of some very
      unconvincing �normal� poses. The top of the barrel that Aang is leaning
      upon shifts and his hand goes into the water up to his shoulder. Cut back
      to the soldier and Haru&#x27;s mother.)

      Mother: What do you want? I&#x27;ve already paid you this week.
      Soldier: The tax just doubled. Wouldn&#x27;t want an accident, would we?

      (The soldier produces a fireball in his hands and smiles. Cut to a wider
      shot, where everyone takes a step back from the soldier.)

      Soldier: Fire is sometimes so hard to control.

      (Haru&#x27;s mother&#x27;s expression melts from defiance to fear and resignation.
      Cut to a view of her hands placing a small chest on a table. She opens it
      to reveal a few miserable coins. She takes most of them out and gives them
      to the soldier. He dumps the small ones on the ground.)

      Soldier: You can keep the copper ones.

      (Cut to a long shot of the room, with the soldier exiting in the
      foreground, the rest clearly visible behind him. They are all unhappy.
      Haru&#x27;s mother picks up the copper coins.)

      Sokka: Nice guy. How long has the Fire Nation been here?
      Mother: Five years. Fire Lord Ozai uses our town&#x27;s coal mines to fuel his
      ships.
      Haru: They&#x27;re thugs; they steal from us, and everyone here is too much of
      a coward to do anything about it.
      Mother: Quiet, Haru. Don&#x27;t talk like that.
      Katara: But, Haru&#x27;s an earthbender, he can help.
      Mother: Earthbending is forbidden. It&#x27;s caused nothing but misery for this
      village. He must never use his abilities.
      Katara: How can you say that? Haru has a gift. Asking him not to earthbend
      is like asking me not to waterbend. It&#x27;s a part of who we are.
      Mother: You don&#x27;t understand.
      Katara: I understand that Haru can help you fight back. What can the Fire
      Nation do to you that they haven&#x27;t done already?
      Mother: They could take Haru away! Like they took his father.

      (Cut to side view of Haru&#x27;s face, with a wide-eyed Katara visible in the
      background. Both look pained. Fade to a view of the surrounding hillsides.
      It is late afternoon. The view pans right to reveal the outbuildings of a
      farm. Cut to a view from inside one of these barn like structures. Haru
      and our group have entered, the open double door visible behind them. The
      late say sun pours in.)

      Haru: My mom said you can sleep here tonight, but you should leave in the
      morning.
      Aang: Thanks. I&#x27;ll make sure Appa doesn&#x27;t eat all your hay.

      (Quick pan right to reveal Appa with his mouth stuffed with hay. He looks
      over at Aang, who is o.c., stops chewing for a few seconds. Then begins
      chewing again. Cut to Haru and Katara leaving the group of buildings,
      apparently going for a walk.)

      Katara: I&#x27;m sorry about what I said earlier. I didn&#x27;t know about your
      father.
      Haru: That&#x27;s ok. It&#x27;s funny, the way you were talking back in the store,
      it reminded me of him.
      Katara: thanks.
      Haru: My father was very courageous. When the Fire Nation invaded, he and
      the other earthbenders were outnumbered ten to one, but they fought back
      anyway.
      Katara: He sounds like a great man.
      Haru: After the attack, they rounded up my father every other earthbender
      and took them away. We haven&#x27;t seen them since.
      Katara: So, that&#x27;s why you hide your earthbending?
      Haru: Yeh. The problem is that the only way I can feel close to my father
      now is when I practice my bending. He taught me everything I know.

      (Katara and Haru have now walked up onto the crest of a small hill that
      overlooks the surrounding countryside. Haru has knelt down and begun
      twirling some small stones while he speaking about his father. When he is
      done, he turns the stones to sand, which falls through his fingers. Katara
      comes up and sits next to him. She points to her necklace and begins to
      speak.)

      Katara: See this necklace? My mother gave it to me.
      Haru: It&#x27;s beautiful.
      Katara: I lost my mother in a Fire Nation raid. This necklace is all I
      have left of her.
      Haru: It&#x27;s not enough, is it?
      Katara: No.

      (Katara and Haru sit on the hill, the fading glory of the setting sun
      visible in the space between them. Fade to Katara and Haru walking down a
      path towards an open mine entrance some way ahead. A boom is heard and
      rocks and dust come out of the mine entrance. The sound of an old man,
      probably hurt, can be heard.)

      Old Man: Help!
      Haru: The mine!

      (They both rush to the mine. Cut to the blocked up mine entrance, the old
      man has almost been buried by the cave in.)

      Old Man: Help me!

      (The ground still shakes a bit, and more earth threatens to fall on and
      crush the old man. Katara and Haru enter the view. Haru tries to prevent
      any more earth falling on the old man by bracing the collapsed mine
      entrance frame, while Katara tries to get the old man free.)

      Katara: (struggling): It&#x27;s not working, we have to get help.
      Haru: There&#x27;s no time � pull harder.
      Katara: Haru, there&#x27;s a way you can help him.
      Haru: I can&#x27;t.
      Katara: Please, there&#x27;s no one around to see you, it&#x27;s the only way.

      (Indecision dominates Haru&#x27;s face for a few moments, but then he moves in
      front of the old man and turns to look back into the min entrance. He
      concentrates and with a quick move of his hands and feet he pushes the
      obstruction of earth and stone back deep into the mine, freeing the old
      man, whom they help get up.)

      Katara: Haru, you did it!

      (Cut to a night scene. Momo is sitting in the window of the outbuilding on
      Haru&#x27;s farm that the group is sleeping in. Cut to a wider shot that shows
      the group ready for bed and in their sleeping bags. Aang lies over the top
      of Appa, looking at Katara.)

      Katara: It was so brave of Haru to use his earthbending to help that old
      man.
      Aang: You must have really inspired him.
      Katara: I guess so.
      Sokka: Everyone should get some sleep. We&#x27;re leaving at dawn.
      Katara: Dawn? Can&#x27;t we sleep in for once?
      Sokka: Absolutely not! This village is crawling with Fire Nation troops.
      If they discover you&#x27;re here, Aang, we&#x27;ll be eating fireballs for
      breakfast. Good night.
      Katara (with a sly grin on her face): I&#x27;d rather eat fireballs than nuts.
      Sokka: Good night.

      (Aang and Katara laugh, then Katara blows out their lamp. Cut to an
      exterior view of their outbuilding which zooms outward, showing the full
      moon. Clearly some time passes before the next scene, but it is still
      night. Fire Nation troops walk along a path leading to Haru&#x27;s farm. Lamps
      on polls swing back and forth as they march. The soldier who extorted the
      money from the previous day leads the column. He wears a helmet with horns
      on either side of his head. He knocks on Haru&#x27;s house&#x27;s door three times.
      The door opens to reveal Haru. He draws an intake of breath in surprise.
      Cut to a side view of the house, where see Haru on the right, the Fire
      soldiers on the left, and in between, pointing an accusatory finger at
      Haru, is the old man saved by Katara and Haru.)

      Old Man: That&#x27;s him! That&#x27;s the earthbender!

      (The solder pushes the old man out of the way and approached Haru. Cut to
      a frontal shot of Haru with the soldier&#x27;s hands entering from the side of
      the frame. He is grabbed and pulled towards the camera, which has the
      effect of going straight into Haru&#x27;s pupil. Cut to commercial.)

      Scene II

      (When the show returns we see an overhead shot of Katara exiting the
      outbuilding. It is dawn. Cut to a closer shot of Katara walking up to a
      water pump to get some water. She carries a pot which she places under the
      spout. Rather than wok the pump, however, she gracefully waterbends some
      water out of the pump and into the jar. She picks up the pot and, as she
      turns to go back to her friends, she notices Haru&#x27;s mother looking out
      over the farm. She turns and it is clear she is crying. Katara drops her
      water pot and it breaks. Katara&#x27;s eye betray her realization that Haru has
      been captured. Cut to an interior shot of the outbuilding where the others
      are packing their gear. The door opens and Katara steps in, tearing at her
      hair in anguish.)

      Katara: They took him! They took Haru away!
      Aang: What?
      Katara: The old man turned him in to the Fire Nation. It&#x27;s all my fault, I
      forced him into earthbending.
      Sokka: Slow down, Katara, when did this happen?

      (Sokka puts his arm around her shoulder and holds her hand in genuine
      concern.)

      Katara: Haru&#x27;s mother said they came for him at midnight.
      Sokka (dropping her hand): Then it&#x27;s too late to track him, he&#x27;s long
gone.
      Katara: We don&#x27;t need to track him. The Fire Nation is going to take me
      right to Haru.
      Aang: �and why would they do that?
      Katara (determined): because they&#x27;re going to arrest me for earthbending.

      (Sokka and Aang both looked concerned before cutting to a scene with
      Katara and Sokka rolling a boulder on top of air grate.)

      Sokka: I thought you were crazy at first, Katara, but this might work.
      There are ventilation shafts throughout these mines, all Aang has to do is
      send an air current from that vent to this one right here. The boulder
      levitates and � tada! Fake earthbending.

      (When Katara and Sokka and finish rolling the boulder on top of the vent,
      cut to a wider shot showing the nearby vent that Aang will airbend into.
      It is partially obscured from the path they are on by a large boulder. Cut
      to Sokka leaning on the rock they have just moved with a self-satisfied
      grin on his face. When he is done, the screen widens to show a none-too
      pleased Katara, hands on her hips, looking over at Aang who is o.c.)

      Katara: Aang. Did you get all that?

      (The screen pans rapidly over to Aang, who is paying no attention at all.
      He sits cross-legged in front of the vent, blowing air and a little
      butterfly in front of him while Momo watches.)

      Aang: Sure, I got it.
      Sokka: Do you remember your cue?
      Aang: Yeh, yeh, just relax. You&#x27;re taking all the fun out of this.
      Sokka: By �this� do you mean intentionally getting captured by an army of
      ruthless firebenders?
      Aang: Exactly! That&#x27;s fun stuff.

      (Cut to wide shot that shows Katara and Sokka on the left, Aang in the
      middle behind his rock, and a band of Fire Nation soldiers coming down to
      the path towards them on the right.)

      Sokka: Here they come! Get in your places!

      (Cut to a close up of the three soldiers marching down the path. Cut to
      view from behind the soldiers. Sokka runs in from the left, Katara from
      the right, meeting right in front of the soldiers.)

      Sokka (in a slightly exaggerated voice): Get out of my way, pipsqueak!
      Katara (also in a slightly exaggerated voice): How dare you call me
      �pipsqueak� you giant-eared cretin!
      Sokka: What did you call me?
      Katara: A giant-eared cretin! Look at those things. (She puts her hands up
      to her ears and fans out her fingers in imitation of huge ears) Do herds
      of animals use them for shade?
      Sokka: You better back off! (Placing his hand to partially block his mouth
      from the soldier&#x27;s view) Seriously � back off.
      Katara: I will not back off! I bet elephants get together and make fun of
      how large your ears are!
      Sokka: That&#x27;s it � you&#x27;re going down!
      Katara: I&#x27;ll show you who&#x27;s boss � earthbending style!

      (Katara assumes a mock earthbending stance as she shouts her challenge.
      The background music changes to indicate almost supernatural powers and
      the background itself changes to show earth colored patterns flashing by
      at high speed. Both effects stop abruptly to show Katara frozen, with the
      rock she is supposed to be �earthbending� still sitting over the grate.
      After a few moments of embarrassed silence, she repeats herself angrily.)

      Katara: I said, �earthbending style!�

      (Cut to the other side of the rock where Aang finally reacts, jumping up
      into the air and coming down onto the grate. He airbends into the grate.
      Cut to a view of the rock on top of the other grate. The air rushing up
      raises the rock to reveal Momo behind it.)

      Soldier (pointing at Momo): That lemur! It&#x27;s earthbending!
      Sokka: No, you idiot! It&#x27;s the girl!
      Soldier (embarrassed): Oh, of course.

      (Cut back to Sokka and Katara as the rocks falls back onto the grate).

      Sokka (in an exaggerated voice, his hands on Katara&#x27;s shoulders): I&#x27;ll
      hold her! (Then sotto voce) You&#x27;ve got 12 hours to find Haru, we&#x27;ll be
      right behind you.

      (Cut to Katara being led off by the soldiers. She looks back to see Sokka
      and Aang, with Momo on his shoulders, standing in the road. Sokka turns to
      Momo.)

      Sokka: Momo, you have some big ears!

      (Cut to a long shot of the village&#x27;s port where a Fire Navy ship is
      docked, then cut to a downcast Katara wearing a brown sackcloth over her
      blue robe. She is in a wheeled transport with other prisoners being taken
      to the prison ship. Aang and Sokka are in the crowd watching her being
      taken aboard. Cut to a sky shot of Appa following the Fire Navy ship from
      afar. In the distance, a rig or offshore platform is seen. This is the
      Fire Navy ship&#x27;s destination. Cut to a close of the rig. It is huge, dark,
      industrial and foreboding. In the background a bloody sunset casts its
      last rays of light over the complex. Switch to Aang in Appa&#x27;s driver&#x27;s
      seat, Sokka in the passenger section.)

      Sokka: She&#x27;ll be fine, Aang, Katara knows what she&#x27;s doing.

      (Cut back to a long shot of the prison rig where the sun has now set.
      Switch to an overhead shot of a prisoner line up. The Warden is addressing
      the new prisoners.)

      Warden: Earthbenders, it is my pleasure to welcome you aboard my modest
      shipyard. I am your warden. I prefer to think of you not as prisoners, but
      as honored guests, and I hope you come to think of me as your humble and
      caring host. You will succeed here if you simply abide �

      (The Warden&#x27;s speech is interest by a prisoner, who is visible behind the
      warden, who begins to cough. The Warden&#x27;s look hardens instantly. Cut to a
      side shot where the Warden suddenly leaps away from the prisoner line up,
      turns and firebends a hug gout of flame at the coughing prisoner. The
      targeted man jumps backwards.)

      Warden (angry): What kind of guest dishonors his host by interrupting
      him!? Take him below! (Then quietly) One week in solitary will improve his
      manners. (He puts his face up to Katara&#x27;s, but still speaking to the
      group) Simply treat me with the courtesy I give you and we&#x27;ll get along
      famously. You will notice earthbenders, that this rig is made entirely of
      metal. You are miles away from any rock or earth, so if you have any
      illusions about employing that brutish savagery that passes for bending
      among you people, forget them. It is impossible. Good day.

      (During the latter part of the Warden&#x27;s speech, the view has shifted
      between various shots of hopeless prisoners on the rig. When the Warden is
      done, he turns and walks o.c. as the prisoners are led away. Cut to a
      rolling pan up where the camera finally reveals an open area on the rig
      where hopeless and forlorn looking prisoners roam around. Cut to a view of
      Katara being thrust through a narrow door and out into the open area. A
      double gate drops behind her, then cut to Katara&#x27;s p.o.v. as she surveys
      the prisoners on the deck. Cut to a side view of the deck. Katara enters
      from the left. As she passes a prisoner sitting on the deck, he turns and
      it is Haru.)

      Haru (standing up): Katara?
      Katara (running and hugging him): Haru!
      Haru: What are you doing here?
      Katara: It&#x27;s my fault you were captured. I came to rescue you.
      Haru: So, you got yourself arrested?
      Katara: It was the only way to find you.
      Haru (folding his arms across his chest and smiling): You got guts,
      Katara, I&#x27;ll give you that. (Taking her shoulder) Come one, there&#x27;s
      someone I want you to meet.

      (Cut to overhead shot that pans right over several groups of prisoners.
      Haru and Katara have approached the last one.)

      Haru: Katara, this is my father, Tyro. Dad, this is Katara.

      (Cut to a view of older man&#x27;s face who is sitting on the ground in one of
      the groups of prisoners. He is eating, but he turns to his son&#x27;s voice and
      sees Katara.)

      Katara (bowing): It&#x27;s an honor to meet you.
      Tyro (handing Katara a bowl): Have some dinner, Katara.
      Katara (taking the bowl her hungry expression turns to disgust): Eruhh!
      Tyro: It&#x27;s not as bad as it looks.
      Katara (sitting down and eating a spoonful): Erahh!
      Tyro (smiling apologetically): It&#x27;s still pretty bad though.

      (A hand appears on Tyro&#x27;s shoulder, another prisoner trying to get Tyro&#x27;s
      attention.)

      Prisoner: Tyro, the prisoners are complaining there aren&#x27;t enough blankets
      to go around.
      Tyro: I&#x27;ll talk to the guards. In the meantime, make sure the elderly are
      taken care of. The rest of us will simply have to hope for warmer weather.
      Katara: If you don&#x27;t mind me asking, what&#x27;s your escape plan?
      Tyro (suspiciously): Excuse me?
      Katara: You know, the plan to get everyone off the rig? What is it?
      Mutiny? Sabotage?
      Tyro: The plan? The plan is to survive - wait out this war. Hope that one
      day some of us can get back home and forget this ever happened.
      Katara: How can you say that? You sound like you&#x27;ve already given up.
      Tyro: Katara, I admire your courage and I envy your youth, but people&#x27;s
      lives are at stake here. The Warden is a ruthless man, and he won&#x27;t stand
      for any rebellion. I&#x27;m sorry, but we&#x27;re powerless.
      Katara (standing up, grim determination on her face): We&#x27;ll see about
that.

      (Cut to Katara standing up on a small raised platform in the open area.
      She bangs the lid of a pot with her spoon several times to get everyone&#x27;s
      attention.)

      Katara: Earthbenders! You don&#x27;t know me, but I know of you. Every child of
      my water tribe village was rocked to sleep with stories of the brave Earth
      Kingdom and the courageous earthbenders who guard its borders. (Cut to a
      view of the Warden watching from one of the catwalks above, Katara
      continues from o.c.) Some of you may think that the Fire Nation has made
      you powerless. Yes, they have taken away your ability to bend, but they
      can&#x27;t take away your courage and it is your courage they should truly
      fear! Because it runs deeper than any mine you&#x27;ve been forced to dig, any
      ocean that keeps you far from home. It is the strength of your hearts that
      make you who you are, hearts that will remain unbroken when all rock and
      stone has eroded away. The time to fight back is now! I can tell you the
      Avatar has returned! So remember your courage, earthbenders, let us fight
      for our freedom!

      (The scene concludes with a close up profile of Katara&#x27;s face, etched in
      determination. After a few moments pass, her expression weakens. Cut to a
      view of the groups of prisoners, who turned away from her and go on with
      their conversations. Katara is crushed. Cut to the Warden, who smiles and
      walks away. Shift to a view of the rig&#x27;s lighthouse lamp rotating in the
      darkness. A few shots of the rig fly by to be replaced by a view of Aang
      peeping up over the edge of the rig. Then cut to Katara sleeping on her
      mat. Aang wakes her up and she starts to cry out, but Aang �shh&#x27;s� her. He
      leads back to the edge of the rig&#x27;s main platform where Appa and Sokka are
      waiting.)

      Sokka: Your 12 hours are up, where&#x27;s Haru? We&#x27;ve got to get out of here.

      (Aang hops off the platform and onto Appa. Sokka holds her arm out to
      Katara.)

      Katara: I can&#x27;t.
      Sokka: We don&#x27;t have much time, there are guards everywhere. Get on.
      Aang: Katara, what&#x27;s wrong?
      Katara (close up, the lighthouse lamp playing directly behind her head):
      I&#x27;m not leaving. I&#x27;m not giving up on these people.

      (Cut to commercial break.)

      Scene III

      (When the show returns, Sokka and Aang have jumped off Appa, who floats in
      the air beside the platform, and are sitting in a triangle on the rig&#x27;s
      edge.)

      Sokka: What do you mean you&#x27;re not leaving!?
      Katara: We can&#x27;t abandon these people. There has to be a way to help them.
      Aang: Maybe she&#x27;s right. What do you say, Sokka?
      Sokka: I say you&#x27;re both crazy! (A searchlight comes close by and they
      hunker down until it passes.) Last chance, we need to leave � now!
      Katara: No.
      Sokka (shaking his head): I hate when you get like this. (Another search
      light comes close). Come on, we better hide.

      (The three exit the frame. Cut to Aang whispering something to Appa, who
      flies off silently. Aang then exits the screen, which then pans northeast
      to show two Fire Soldiers turning the corner on the rounds. As the round
      the bend, Appa flies by and the guards notice and look up.)

      Guard: Look!

      (Cut to a close up of the back of the Warden&#x27;s head. He turns quickly to
      address the guards who just saw Appa.)

      Warden: Tell me exactly what you saw.
      Captain: Well, Sir, it looked like a flying bison.
      Warden: What?
      Guard It was a giant flying buffalo, Sir, with an empty saddle.
      Warden: Which was it? A buffalo or a bison?
      Captain: Uh, I&#x27;m not sure what the difference is, but that&#x27;s not really
      the point is it, Sir?
      Warden (angry): I&#x27;ll decide what the point is, fool!

      (Warden throws the Captain over the railing. A scream trails off into
      nothing as a splash of water is heard. Cut back to the Warden and the
      remaining guard.)

      Warden: You! Wake up the Captain. Search the entire rig!
      Guard: Sir?
      Warden: What!?
      Guard: That�was the Captain you just threw overboard, so�
      Warden: Then wake up someone I haven&#x27;t thrown overboard and search the
      rig! There&#x27;s something going on here and I don&#x27;t like it.

      (Cut to an overhead shot of the rig, still on the same night. The view
      pans north to reveal a loading docks with many crates on it. Cut to a
      closer shot of Momo peeping over one of the crates, then shift to Katara,
      Aang, and Sokka crouching amongst the boxes.)

      Sokka: We don&#x27;t have much time. What are we gonna do?
      Aang: I wish I knew how to make a hurricane. (Cut to Katara and Sokka
      looking unhappy at this idea.) The Warden would run away and we&#x27;d steal
      his keys!
      Sokka: Wouldn&#x27;t he just take his keys with him?
      Aang: I&#x27;m just tossing ideas around.
      Katara: I tired talking the earthbenders into fighting back, but it didn&#x27;t
      work. If there was just a way to help them help themselves.
      Sokka: For that they&#x27;d need some kind of earth, or some rock� something
      they can bend.
      Katara (touching the rig platform): But this entire place is made of
metal.
      Aang (looking up and pointing o.c.): No, it&#x27;s not. Look at the smoke. I
      bet they&#x27;re burning coal � In other words, earth.

      (As Aang is speaking, the view cuts to a shot of the smokestacks on the
      upper reaches of the rig. Behind the stacks, the sky is clearly getting
      lighter. Cut to a long shot of the rig, dawn is clearly close at hand. Cut
      to Katara and Sokka back in the prisoner deck area where Katara gave her
      speech. They are looking down into an enormous ventilation shaft which is
      capped by a grate similar to the ones seen earlier near the mine where
      Katara got arrested.)

      Katara: It&#x27;s almost dawn, we&#x27;re running out of time! Are you sure this is
      gonna work?
      Sokka: It should. These vents reminded me of our little trick back at the
      village. We&#x27;re gonna do the same thing, but on a much bigger scale.

      (Cut to an overhead shot of the rig as Sokka explains from o.c. how the
      plan is going to work. As he speaks, the camera view moves or cuts to show
      what he is talking about.)

      Sokka: There&#x27;s a huge deposit of coal at the base of the silo, and the
      whole system is ventilated. Aang closed off all the vents except one. When
      he does his airbending, the coal only has one place to go � right back
      here.

      (The view ends up back with Katara and Sokka as he concludes his
      explanation. It is now morning. A moment later, however, the shot widens
      to show them surrounded by six Fire Nation soldiers poiting there spears
      at them and prisoners, including Tyro and Haru. More Fire Nation guards
      ring the bottom edge of the shot.)

      Soldier: There&#x27;s the intruder!
      Sokka (drawing his boomerang): Stay back, I&#x27;m warning you!
      Tyro: Katara stop! You can&#x27;t win this fight!

      (Cut from Tyro to Haru, who looks stunned at his father&#x27;s pronouncement.
      The camera pans right across him, then cut to Katara with an equally
      stunned looked, the camera slowly panning left. Then from o.c., but
      switching to show him after a few words, the Warden arrives.)

      Warden: Listen to him well, child. You&#x27;re one mistake away from dying
      where you stand.

      (Cut to a wider shot of the two surrounded by the soldiers, who begin to
      close in. Then switch to a close up of the grate, where air begins to rush
      out, followed by dust and pebbles. Then a living river of coal erupts from
      the grate, eventually tearing it away. Cut to a very wide shot showing the
      eruption of coal as it shoots high into the air over the deck, blasting
      the grate away. Cut to the Warden, clearly shocked and dismayed. The coal
      lands in a massive pile between the earthbenders and the firebenders,
      followed by a shot of Haru. The shot then widens to show the prisoners
      looking at the pile of earth that has just appeared. Cut to a view of the
      top of the coal pile. Aang drops from the top of the screen and lands on
      it, covered in coal dust. He coughs it off as Katara runs up to the top of
      the coal.)

      Katara: Here&#x27;s your chance, earthbenders! (She grabs a lump of coal and
      raises it high.) Take it! Your fate is in your own hands!

      (Haru begins to move forward, but Tyro stops him. Switch to a view from
      within the crowd. Various prisoners begin to shrink backward, eschewing
      open conflict. Cut to a view of Katara, still holding up the lump of coal,
      with the Warden and his men visible over her shoulder.)

      Warden: Hahaha! Foolish girl! You thought a few inspirational words and
      some coal would change these people? Look at these blank, hopeless faces.
      (Cut to a panning shot of the prisoners, who do look sad.) There spirits
      were broken a long time ago. Oh? But you still believe in them? (Katara
      lowers the coal, shock on her face.) How sweet. They&#x27;re a waste of your
      energy, little girl. You&#x27;ve failed.

      (Cut to a wider shot of Katara standing on the coal, her shoulders
      slumped, looking defeated and lonely. The Warden turns to walk back into
      the rig. As he does, a lump of coal flies on screen and hits him in the
      back of the head. He turns in anger. Cut to Haru, prisoners standing
      behind him, twirling some lumps of coal above his raised left hand. His
      expression is severe. Cut back to the Warden, who launches a blast of fire
      at the boy. The gout of flame is about to engulf Haru, who braces for
      death, when it is blocked by a wall of coal. Cut to a shot of Tyro, in an
      earthbending stance, who has clearly stepped forward to protect his son.
      Cut to a wider of what is about to become the battlefield, before shifting
      the Warden and his men, now in a firing line.)

      Warden: Show no mercy!

      (The Fire Nation line charges forward, unleashing a wall of flame. Tyro
      and the three nearest earthbenders, including Haru block it with a huge
      wall of coal. The coal absorbs the flames.)

      Tyro: For the Earth Kingdom, attack!

      (Tyro slams the palms of his fists on the deck of the rig, throwing the
      wall of coal forward towards the Fire Nation line. The Fire Soldiers
      deflect some of the rocks with flame. Cut to an overhead shot of the
      prisoners, all of whom have joined the rebellion and have assumed
      earthbending stances. The camera pans south to show the firebenders in a
      similar pose. General melee ensues. One on one the earthbenders block fire
      attacks with coal shields and knock out firebender by striking htem huge
      lumps of coal thrown at high speed. Cut to a view of the carnage below
      from one of the catwalks. Heaps of burning coal now litter the deck.
      Switch back to the middle of the deck where Katara, Sokka and Aang are
      rushing forward. A Fire Nation soldier enters the screen, but Sokka cuts
      off the head of his spear with his boomerang and throws the spearhead with
      a small shaft still attached to it to Momo who is flying close overhead.
      Momo then collects spears as they are thrown by Fire Nation soldiers,
      rendering them harmless. Cut to Tyro and Haru in front of the coal dump.
      They raise a huge amount of coal, and then mash it between them to create
      a boulder. Cut to a quick view of the Warden rapidly shooting fireballs at
      targets o.c., before switching back to Haru and Tyro throwing the boulder
      at the door into the rig. It blasts a boulder shaped hole in the door.)

      Tyro: Get to the ship! We&#x27;ll hold them off!
      Warden: Do not let them escape!

      (The Warden rallies a few his troops and they begin to barrage the exit
      with flame. Cut to Aang, Katara and Sokka trying to exit. When they see
      the flames hit the wall in front of them, they turn and Aang airbends a
      small tornado into existence, the end of which is aimed at the
      firebenders.)

      Aang: Guys, throw me some coal!

      (Sokka and Katara start dropping chunks of coal into the top of the little
      whirlwind, which accelerate down the wind tube and exit at high speed
      towards the Warden&#x27;s men. Then all get knocked down. Cut to Tyro and two
      other earthbenders who earthbend the entire coal dump, with the Warden and
      all his men on it, out of over the open water.)

      Warden: No, please! I can&#x27;t swim!
      Tyro: Don&#x27;t worry, I hear cowards float.

      (Tyro drops them all into the ocean below. Fade to a scene of several Fire
      Nation ships, now under the command of the former prisoners, steaming away
      from the rig. Appa with Sokka and Aang swim next to the point ship. Cut to
      Katara, Tyro and Haru on the deck of the point ship. Katara beams, looking
      back at the prison they leave behind. She is missing her necklace.)

      Haru: I want to thank you for saving me. For saving us.
      Katara (embarrassed): All it took was a little coal.
      Haru: It wasn&#x27;t the coal, Katara, it was you.
      Tyro (putting a hand on her shoulder): Thank you for helping me find my
      courage, Katara, of the water tribe. My family and everyone here owes you
      much.
      Katara: So, I guess you&#x27;re going home now?
      Tyro: Yes, to take back my village. (Raising his voice and raising his
      left hand in a fist, just as Katara had done and looking back over the
      ship to address the former prisoners) To take back ALL of our villages!
      The Fire Nation will regret the day they set foot on our land!

      (Cut to a wide shot of three of the ships, Tyro&#x27;s ship in the middle and
      ahead with Appa swimming on the right. The shot pans from left to right,
      showing cheering earthbenders on the decks of every ship. Cut back to Haru
      and Katara.)

      Haru: Come with us.
      Katara: I can&#x27;t. Your mission is to take back your home. Ours is to get
      Aang to the North Pole.

      (Cut to a shot of Aang in the foreground sitting on Appa, airbending a
      little chunk of coal around. Katara and Haru are visible on the upper deck
      on the point ship.)

      Haru: That&#x27;s him, isn&#x27;t it? The Avatar. Katara, thank you for bringing my
      father back to me. I never thought I&#x27;d see him again. I only wish there
      was some way�
      Katara: I know. (She reaches for her necklace and starts in surprise when
      it is gone.) My mother&#x27;s necklace! It&#x27;s gone!

      (Cut to a close up shot of the necklace lying on the deck of the rig. An
      arm in a Fire Nation uniform grabs it. The screen pans up to reveal Zuko,
      wreathed in the glory of a fiery red sunset holding the necklace. He looks
      out over the ocean to the setting sun, back to the camera. Fade to white.)

第六回
入狱

太好了，你终于回来了，晚饭吃啥？
咱们今晚吃自助餐，你可以选圆形坚果，
椭圆形坚果，或者是石头形的坚果，没准它就是石头
-砸了它，吃吧
-说真的，有没有点实在的
那是啥声音啊？
声音是从那边来的
你们不是傻了吧，不赶紧躲起来，反倒跑过去看
-是个御土师
-咱们去会会他
他看起来很危险，咱们小心点慢慢靠近
你好啊，我叫卡塔拉, 你贵姓啊
兴会啊！
我只想打个招呼
那个人肯定跑去哪了，附近可能会有城镇
那里肯定会有集市
太好了，晚饭就不用吃坚果了
嘿，我辛辛苦苦才搞到那些坚果的
好啦，我承认，我也不愿意那它们当晚饭
这帽子不错啊，我拿坚果跟你换吧
-嘿，老妈
-阿鲁，你跑到哪去了
都这么晚了，别忘了你还要做家务
嘿，你就是刚才那个男孩吧
-为啥你刚才要跑呢？
-你一定是认错人了
她才没认错呢，我们刚才还看到你用御土术来着
他们看见你干什么了？
老妈，你怎么能信他们，看他们穿得古里古怪的
你知道那有多危险，如果被抓到的话，
你知道后果是什么
快开门
是火宗的，大家表现的自然点
我这个星期已经交过租了，你还要干什么？
上头有令，税钱加倍，你不想这里发生意外火灾吧？
有时候火可是很难控制的哦
这些零钱就不要了
真是个大善人啊
火国军队来这儿多久了？
已经五年了，烈火王 欧宰 用我们这里的煤为他的战船提供燃料
这帮暴徒，欺压我们，
可这儿的人都太懦弱，没人出来和他们斗
小声点，阿鲁, 别那样说话。
但是阿鲁是个御土师，他可以和他们斗
在这里御土术被禁止了，
御土术只能给这个村子带来不幸
他不能再使用御土术
你咋能这么说呢，阿鲁很有天赋
让他不用御土术，就像不让我用御水术一样
-御土术已经是他生命的一部分了
-你不了解这儿的情况
我知道阿鲁可以帮助你们进行反击
看看火国军队都对你作了什么，他们不会就这样善罢甘休的
他们可能会抓走阿鲁的
像抓走他父亲一样
老妈说你们今晚可以睡在这儿，但明早必须离开
好的，谢了。我不会让阿柏把你们的干草都吃光的
我对我之前说过的话道歉，对你父亲的事我很遗憾
没关系的，有趣的是，
你在商店时说话的方式让我想起了父亲
-是吗？
-我父亲很有骨气
当火国大军时，他和其他的
御土师奋起反抗，以一抵十
他一定是个很伟大的人
在战斗之后，他们包围了父亲和其他御土师，
把他们抓走了，从那之后就再也没见过他
所以你一直隐瞒自己会使用御土术？
没错，现在只有在练习御土术的时候，
我才能感到父亲的存在
我所会的一切都是他传授的
-我戴的这条项链，是俺娘送给我的
-它真漂亮
在火国入侵时，她去世了。
这条项链是她留给我唯一一件东西。
-很想她，是吧
-嗯哪
-救命啊
-是矿塌了
救我啊
这没不行，我们得去叫人来帮忙
时间不够了，用力拉
阿鲁，现在只有你能帮他
我不行
拜托了，周围没有人会看见的，这是唯一的办法了
阿鲁，你成功了
阿鲁真英勇，他用御土术就了那个老人家
-肯定是你的鼓励起了作用
-可能是吧
行了，都歇了吧，大清早还要赶路呢
大清早就走？不能睡个懒觉吗？
绝对不行，这个村里到处都是火国军队
如果他们发现安昂在这儿，
明早就得拿火球当早餐了。晚安啊
-火球也比坚果好吃
-我说过了，晚安！
就是他，他是个御土师
他们把他抓走了，他们抓走了阿鲁
-啥？-那个老头向火国军高密了，
都是我的错，我强迫他用的御土术
别着急，他们啥时把他抓走的？
-阿鲁娘说他们半夜时来抓的人
-这就很难跟踪他们了，一定走得很远了
不用跟踪他们，火国军会把我带到阿鲁那儿的
他们干嘛要那么做呢？
因为我要用御土术给他们看
起初我还以为你傻了呢，现在想想没准能成功
这些通风井遍及这些煤矿，
安昂只需从那边的通风孔送入气流
这个石球就会飘起来，嗒啦~ 假御土术就成功了
安昂, 你都听明白了吗？
当然，当然，我明白
你都记住了？
了了，了了~放轻松，不要弄没了这其中的乐趣
啥？你觉得用假御土术而让火国军抓去很有趣吗？
没错，这件事挺好玩的
他们来了，各就各位
别挡道，矮妞！
你竟敢叫我矮妞，你这个大耳朵白痴
-你叫我啥？
-大耳朵白痴
瞧你那对大耳朵，大的都可以给一群动物遮荫了
-你最好个我闪远点。说真的，你得闪远点
-我可没那么听话
估计大象见到你的大耳朵都会觉得可笑
够了，不收拾你是不行了
让你看看这儿谁说的算
御土神功！
我说过了，御土神功！
那个狐猴居然会用御土术
你们这帮白痴，是这个女孩用的御土术
哦，当然啦
我抓住她了。你有个小时去找阿鲁
我们就跟在你后面
模模，你的耳朵才真叫大呢
她会没事的，卡塔拉知道自己在干什么
各位御土师们，你们大驾光临敝人的造船所，我不胜荣幸
我就是这儿的典狱长，但是我并没有
把各位看作是犯人，我视各位为上宾
我也希望大家不要拘束，把我看成是卑下的主人
只要你们规规矩矩的，你们就...
哪种客人会随随便便的打断主人的演讲？
把他给我拖下去
进面壁房没准能让他长长记性
只要好好的照我说的做，保管你们不会出什么问题
你们可能发现了，这里所有的结构都是有钢铁制成，哪儿都没有土和石头
如果还试图用御土术搞暴乱逃跑，
那简直就是痴心妄想
好好干活吧
-卡塔拉?
-阿鲁!
-你来这儿干嘛？
-你被抓都是我的错，我来这儿救你出去
-所以你就让自己被抓了？
-这是能找到你得唯一方法
我不得不佩服你的勇气
过来，想介绍个人给你认识
卡塔拉, 这是我的父亲 泰罗（暂译）
老爸，这是卡塔拉
能见到您是我的荣幸
卡塔拉，来吃点晚饭吧
并没有看上去那么难吃
不过还是不怎么好吃
-泰罗，大家开始 抱怨没有足够的毯子来御寒
-我会去跟守卫交涉的
你去看看，要确保老人们能被很好的照顾，
我们其他人只能期盼天气能够暖和起来了
恕我冒昧，你的逃跑计划是什么？
-你说啥？
-就是让大家逃离钻塔，怎么做？造反还是破坏？
计划？我们的计划就是能够活下来
终有一天战争会结束，人们会回到家，
忘掉这里发生的一切
你怎么能这么说呢？好像你已经放弃了希望
卡塔拉, 我敬佩你的勇气，更嫉妒的年轻
我要为活着的人着想，典狱长是个凶残的人，
他不会给我们机会的
很遗憾，我们现在没有力量能够反抗
我就不信这个邪
御土师们，听我说。你们并不了解我，但我深知你们
我们水族部落的孩子们每天
都是伴着土国勇士的故事入眠的
土国人坚守土地的故事激励着我们
你们当中的一些人认为火国军队削弱了你们的力量
没错，他们剥削了你们御土的能力
但是他们夺不走你们的勇气
拿出你们的勇气给他们看看，
在真正的勇气面前这片海洋也不能
阻挡你们回到自己的家乡
只有坚强的心才能找回自我
我们的心要远比土石来的坚强
是时候该奋起反击了！
告诉大家，降世神通已经回来了！
让我们鼓起勇气，为我的自由而斗争！
一切按你的计划进行，阿鲁在哪？咱们得离开了
-我还不能走
-咱们时间不多，这里到处都是警卫。快上来
卡塔拉！怎么了？
我不会走的
我不会放弃这些人的
你说你不走，是啥意思？
我们不能放弃这些人
肯定有办法能够帮助他们
可能她是对的，你怎么看，索卡？
我看你俩都疯了
这是最后的机会了，我们现在得走了
-我不走
-真不知道你怎么会这样
咱们得找个地方躲一下
-看哪！
-说清楚了，你们到底看到了什么？
-那个，长官，它看上去好像是个飞天野牛    -啥？
-长官，是个巨大的飞天水牛之类的东西，
只是鞍上没有人
到底是啥？是野牛还是水牛
（bison和buffalo二词没有显著的差别）
我不知道这两个有什么区别，
而且这也不是问题所在，不是吗？
白痴，这里只有我决定什么是问题所在
那个谁，把船长给我叫起来，搜查整个钻塔
-长官    -又咋的？
-刚才被你扔到水里的就是船长，那个...
那就找个没被我扔到水里的人来管事，搜查整个区域，有我不喜欢的事要发生
时间不多，我们要做点啥？
我就知道我应该弄个飓风啥的
典狱长会被吓跑的，然后我们就可以拿他留下的钥匙了
-要是他带着要是一起跑了呢
-我只是想提个建议嘛
我试着鼓励御土师们奋起反击，但没起作用
一定有办法能够让他们帮助自己走出困境
他们需要土才能使用御土术，石头也行
但这里整个是由金属制成的
并不全是，看那儿的烟
他们肯在那里烧煤，也就是说这里有土
已经天亮了，我们没时间了，你确定这方法有用？
应该有用，这和在村里耍的把戏原理一样，
只是这回规模要大一些
在竖井下堆着大量的煤块，整个系统都是连通的，
安昂将其他的通气孔都封死，
只留下一个，当他用御气术时，
那些煤块只有一个地方可去，也就是这儿
快抓住入侵者！
-别过来，我警告你们
-卡塔拉，快停下，你赢不了他们的
不听老人言，你就会血溅当场的
御土师们，你们的机会来了，
抓住它，你们的命运就掌握在你们的手里
傻丫头，几句鼓励的话，
几块破煤球就能改变这些人吗？
看看这些空虚绝望的脸吧，
他们的精神在很久之前就已经崩溃了
但是你仍然信任他们啊，真令人感动啊
别白费力气了，小妞，你输定了
不能放过他们！
为了土强国，进攻！
快到船上去，我们来拖住他们
别让他们跑了！
伙计们，给我些煤球
-天啊，不要啊，我不会游泳
-别担心，煤能浮起来的
谢谢你救了我，救了我们大家
-我只是弄了一些煤球而已
-并不是煤球那么简单，都是你的功劳
来自水族部落的卡塔拉，谢谢你让我找回了勇气
我的家庭，还有这里的所有人都亏欠你很多
-现在是回家的时候了
-是啊，夺回我们的村子，救回我们所有的村民!
火国军队要为夺走我们的家园而付出代价！
-跟我们并肩作战吧
-很抱歉，你们的任务是重拾家园
我们的任务是带安昂去北极
他就是降世神通吧
卡塔拉，多谢你救回了我的父亲
我从来都没想到还能再见到他，
我希望你也能...（见到你的母亲）
是啊...我母亲的项链不见了！

水善国
土强国
火烈国
气和国
很久以前，这四大国和谐共处
然而，火国发起的战争结束了和平
只有同时掌握四种元素的将世神通才能结束战争
然而在大家最需要他的时候，他却消失了
年后，我和哥哥发现了新的降世神通，
他是个御气师，名叫安昂
尽管他的御气术着实厉害
在拯救苍生之前，他要学的还有很多
但是我坚信安昂能拯救这个世界
