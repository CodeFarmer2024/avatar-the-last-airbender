      Scene I

      (Scene opens with a lake view. Camera pans up to reveal Sokka, Aang,
      Katara and Momo sitting around a camp on the lakeshore. A large blue tent
      occupies the left hand portion of the screen. When the camera stops a
      large green fish jumps into view and falls back into the lake. Katara gets
      up and points at it.)

      Katara: Look!

      (Sokka gets up and assumes a gunslinger stance. Cut to a close up of
      Sokka's face, with Katara visible over his right shoulder. Cut to another
      fish in mid-air, it drops back off the screen in slow motion. It appears
      to be some sort of green catfish. Cut to Sokka and Katara again.)

      Sokka: He is taunting us. (Cut to long shot of the group.) You are so
      gonna be dinner! (Sokka runs back to the tent and grabs his fishing pole
      which standing up outside of it, runs back to the lake edge and casts the
      pole a few times without effect.) Hey! Where's the fishing line?
      Aang: Oh, I didn't think you would need it, Sokka. (Holds up a necklace.)
      Sokka: Aahh, it's all tangled!
      Aang: Not tangled � woven. (Airbending himself to a standing position and
      turning to Katara.) I made you a necklace, Katara. (Looking from side to
      side in an embarrassed fashion) I thought since you lost your other one�

      (Aang holds up the necklace and sheepish smile marked by a sound effect
      spreads across his face, cut to Katara.)

      Katara (smiles, walks over to Aang and takes necklace): Thanks, Aang. I
      love it.
      Sokka (again at the water's edge and looking back at Aang): Great, Aang.
      Maybe instead of saving the world you can go into the jewelry making
      business.
      Aang: I don't see why I can't do both. (Katara puts necklace on in the
      background.)

      (Sokka turns his back to the camera to see the fish leaping again from the
      lake. He throws his pole like a spear and it disappears into the water.)

      Sokka: Stop taunting me!

      (A visual effect denoting anger flashes briefly near Sokka's head as he
      says this. He draws his knife from behind his back and enters the water in
      a bandy-legged way. He lunges into the water with the knife trying to
      catch the fish. Aang appears in the foreground, watching Sokka's antics.)

      Katara (from o.c.): So, how do I look?

      (Aang turns to face Katara as she begins to speak. By the end of her
      question Aang's eyes have almost popped out of his skull. He is
      dumfounded. Cut to a view of Katara's lower body with the camera
      immediately beginning to pan up. Around Katara, the world has become
      beautiful, with the rocks and trees bathed in a romantic dark pink or
      purple hue, every object reflecting light as if studded with diamonds. The
      music has changed abruptly to reflect Aang's feelings for Katara. The pan
      ends with a view of Katara's upper body, her hand at her new necklace and
      small patches of red under her eyes, indicated some embarrassment. Cut to
      Aang, who is using his left forefinger to loosen his collar while staring
      at Katara.)

      Aang: You mean all of you or just your neck? I mean, uh, both look great.
      Sokka (who has just emerged from the lake, holding a fish as if about to
      give it a kiss): Smoochie, smoochie, someone's in love. (The fish flips is
      his hands, knocking him back into the lake.)
      Aang (rubbing his head in an embarrassed gesture): I�well�
      Katara (looking in annoyance o.c. towards her brother): Stop teasing him,
      Sokka. (Momo hops up onto Aang's shoulder.) Aang's just a good friend.
      (She rubs Aang's head) A sweet little guy � just like Momo. (She rubs
      Momo's head just as she had Aang's a moment before.)
      Aang (clearly put down): Thanks.

      (Sokka approaches them, sopping wet, empty handed and with a dark look on
      his face. An ominous noise off screen prompts Momo to fly toward it and
      off screen. Cut to a large rock that Momo is sitting on, looking off
      screen. He is joined a moment later by Aang who has clearly airbent
      himself into the air and onto the rock. He points towards the source of
      the noise.)

      Aang: Someone's being attacked by a platypus bear!

      (Cut to see a huge bear like creature with red eyes and the bill of a
      platypus. It bares its teeth and rears itself up on its hind legs. Cut to
      a view from right behind the bear's left shoulder. The bear is threatening
      a man in blue who smiles calmly at the advancing monster. Cut to long shot
      of the bear as it advances, swinging at the man, who dodges the blows by
      causally stepping backwards, hands behind his back. Cut to a view from
      behind the man's right shoulder. The bears swings a few more time while
      Aang jumps up onto a rock behind the bear. Cut to the a frontal shot of
      the man, a smile still plastered on his face.)

      Calm Man (to Aang): Well, hello there. (Bears swings at him from o.c., the
      man dodges.) Nice day, isn't it?
      Aang: Make noise, it'll run off!

      (Screen expands and pans right as Sokka and Katara run up behind Aang.)

      Sokka: No, play dead, he'll lose interest!

      (Cut to wide shot of bear and calm man. The bears swings and misses
again.)

      Calm Man: Whoa! Close one. Haha!
      Katara: Run down hill, then climb a tree!
      Sokka: No, punch him in the bill!
      Aang: And then run in zigzags!
      Calm Man: No need. It's going to be fine.

      (The bear swings again, swiping a large chunk of wood out of a nearby tree
      as the calm man ducks just in time. Aang shoots into the air from off his
      nearby rock up over the head of the bear. He lands, putting himself
      between the calm man and the bear, and airbends up a wall of air that
      momentarily pushes the beast backwards.)

      Aang: Whoa there!

      (The bears rears up and roars, only to have Appa rear up behind him and
      roar. Cut to a side shot of the bear with Appa behind him. The bear drops
      an egg out his behind and runs into the river and swims away. Cut to
      Sokka's arms picking up the large egg.)

      Sokka: Mmm! Lunch! (He sniffs egg, then looks at calm man o.c. with a
      haughty look.) Lucky for you we came along.
      Calm Man: Thanks, but everything was already under control. Not to worry,
      Aunt Wu predicted I'd have a safe journey. (He puts his hands in a
      position of prayer and bows slightly at this.)
      Aang: Aunt who?
      Calm Man: No, Aunt Wu. She's the fortuneteller from my village. Awful nice
      knowing your future.
      Katara: Wow, it must be. That explains why you were so calm.
      Sokka: But the fortuneteller was wrong! You didn't have a safe journey,
      you were almost killed!
      Calm Man: But I wasn't. All right, have a good one! (He gestures in
      farewell and begins to walk away, but turns back again.) Oh, and Aunt Wu
      said if I met any travelers to give them this. (He hands Aang a long, thin
      wrapped object and walks away.)
      Katara: Maybe we should go see Aunt Wu and learn our fortunes. It could be
      fun.
      Sokka: Oh come on, fortunetelling is nonsense.

      (While Sokka is speaking, Aang shreds the objects wrapping to reveal an
      umbrella. When Sokka finishes speaking, the umbrella opens in Aang's
hand.)

      Aang: What do ya know, an umbrella!

      (The sky darkens instantly and thunder is heard as it begins to pour rain.
      Katara smiles and waterbends the rain in a sparkling arc away from her
      head.)

      Katara: That proves it. (She runs under the umbrella with Aang.)
      Sokka (holding the egg above his head to try and deflect the rain): No it
      doesn't � you can't really tell the future.
      Katara: I guess you're not really getting wet then.

      (The egg slips out of Sokka's hands and in his attempts to grab it again
      it flies up into the air and lands back on his head. Cut to the three
      walking down a road. It is still pouring rain. Aang and Katara are under
      the umbrella. Sokka is getting soaked.)

      Sokka: Of course she predicted it was gonna rain. The sky's been gray all
      day.
      Katara: Just admit you might be wrong and you can come under the umbrella.
      Sokka: Look, I'm going to predict the future now (making funny motions and
      in an exaggerated voice) � �It's going to keep drizzling.� (He folds his
      arms across his chest and assumes an expression of defiance.) See!

      (The rain instantly stops and the sun comes out.)

      Aang: Not everyone has the gift, Sokka.

      (Cut to side view of the group walking with Appa bringing up the rear. As
      Appa passes Sokka he shakes off his wet fur, drenching Sokka once again.)

      Sokka (as he gets soaked): Yahhh!

      (Cut to a view of a single snow capped mountain, its peak partially
      obscured in clouds. Camera pans down to reveal a village and its main
      gate. They walk through the gate and come to the village square. In front
      of the circular door of one of the buildings, some sort of herald dressed
      in black greets them.)

      Herald: Aunt Wu is expecting you.
      Katara: Really?

      (The three walk forward as Sokka makes a sound of disgust. Cut to the
      three in a room with three sitting pillows and an open door to the left.
      They have passes through the circular door mentioned above and which is
      now on the right side of the screen. The herald closes this door behind
      them as they walk in. A young girl in a pink kimono and huge hair braids
      that stick straight out from the sides of her head enters from the opening
      on the left.)

      Meng: My name is Meng and I'm Aunt Wu's assistant.

      (Her eyes go wide. Cut to a view of Aang's lower body that pans upwards to
      his face and upper body. The music and background parallel Aang's
      romanticized view of Katara seen earlier. The effect is somewhat spoiled,
      however, by Aang's unenthusiastic facial expression and slightly hunched
      over posture.)

      Meng (to Aang): Well hello there.
      Aang (rubbing his nose): Hello.
      Meng (as Aang and Katara sit on the pillows): Can I get you some tea, or
      some of Aunt Wu's special bean curd puffs?
      Sokka: I'll try a curd puff.
      Meng (giving Sokka the heisman): Just a second. (Bending down to address
      Aang) So what's your name?
      Aang: Aang.
      Meng: That rhymes with Meng! And you've got some pretty big ears, don't
      you?
      Aang (confused): I� guess�
      Sokka: Oh, don't be modest. They're huge!

      (Sokka spreads his arms wide to demonstrate just how huge they are, as
      Aang looks angrily at Sokka. He puts his hands over his ears as if to
      smash them down to an acceptable size.)

      Meng: Well Aang, it is very nice to meet you. Very nice.
      Aang: Likewise.

      (Meng exits, looking back slyly out of the corner of her eye, presumably
      at Aang. Cut to shot of the three seated on the pillows.)

      Sokka: I can't believe we're here in the house of nonsense.
      Katara: Try to keep an open mind, Sokka. There are things in this world
      that just can't be explained. Wouldn't it be nice to have some insight
      into your future?
      Sokka: It would be nice to have some bean curd puffs.

      (Katara looks annoyed at this. Cut to overhead shot of the hallway
      adjacent to the reception room the three are sitting in. The hallway shows
      another door leading farther into the building. From the right, Meng
      appears with a tray of refreshments. A moment later the inner door opens
      to reveal a young woman in a green kimono. She rushes over to Meng.)

      Woman in Green: Oh Meng! Aunt Wu says I'm going to meet my true love! He's
      going to give me a rare panda lilly.
      Meng (with Aang visible over her right shoulder): That's so romantic.
      (Looks dreamily over at Aang) I wonder if my true love will give me a rare
      flower.
      Aang (earnestly): Good luck with that!
      Woman in Green (amused): Is that the big eared guy who Aunt Wu predicted
      you'd marry?

      (Meng shoves the young woman o.c. and brings the tray over to the three,
      but her eyes are fixed on Aang. She trips and almost dumps the food on
      Aang, but he helps steady her grip on the tray. His hands now hold hers as
      they together hold the tray. They share a moment looking into each other's
      eyes.)

      Meng (embarrassed): Enjoy your snack. (She exits with a short fairy dust
      sound effect.)
      Aunt Wu (from o.c. at first): Welcome young travelers. (Cut to torso shot
      of Aunt Wu in a yellow or gold kimono looking serene.) Now, who's next?
      Don't be shy.

      (Both boys look uninterested. Screen pans left to Katara.)

      Katara: I guess that's me.

      (Katara runs o.c. to follow Aunt Wu. Cut to Aang and Sokka, the latter of
      which is chomping on curd puffs.)

      Sokka: Not bad. Not bad. Mmmm! (Offers puffs to Aang.)
      Aang (pushing puffs away): I'm good on puffs. So�what do you think they're
      talking about back there?
      Sokka: Boring stuff, I'm sure. Love. Who she's going to marry. How many
      babies she's gonna have.
      Aang (growing more alarmed at each of Sokka's pronouncements): Yeh� dumb
      stuff like that� (bites his fingernails, eyes wide) well, I've gotta find
      a bathroom!

      (Aang runs o.c. as Sokka stretches out over the pillows and eats another
      puff. Momo grabs the bowl of puffs and runs off. Cut to Aang walking down
      the hall near the inner door, obviously trying to be quiet so he can
      eavesdrop. All between Katara and Aunt Wu from o.c., camera on Aang.)

      Aunt Wu: Your palms are so smooth � do you use moisturizer?
      Katara: Actually, I have this special seaweed lotion. I could get you some
      if you want. (Aang sticks his tongue out, his face clearly expressing his
      disdain for discussions around moisturizer) So, do you see anything
      interesting in my love line? (Aang's eyes bug out instantly and he leans
      in close to hear.)
      Aunt Wu: I feel great romance for you. The man you're going to marry�
      Katara: Tell me more!
      Aunt Wu: I can see that he is a very powerful bender.

      (The sound of an egg timer going off is heard, and Aang's expression flips
      from wide eyed to smug in an instant. Happy music plays. Cut to long shot
      of him in the hallway as he launches himself into the air, ecstatic over
      this news. Clearly there is no doubt in his mind as to what this
      prediction means. Cut to Sokka picking his teeth. Aang walks back into the
      reception room looking like the cat who ate the canary.)

      Sokka: Looks like someone had a pretty good bathroom break.
      Aang: Yeh, when I was in there�
      Sokka: I don't even wanna know!

      (Aunt Wu and Katara enter.)

      Aunt Wu: Who's next?
      Sokka (standing): Okay, let's get this over with.
      Aunt Wu (looking unhappily at Sokka): Your future is full of struggle and
      anguish, most of it self-inflicted.
      Sokka: But, you didn't read my palms or anything!
      Aunt Wu: I don't need to � it's written all over your face. (Cut to Sokka,
      who looks displeased. To Aang) You then, come with me.

      (Aang follows her out, Sokka sits down and pouts. Cut to Aang and Aunt Wu
      entering her inner chamber. It is a simple room with the four red pillars
      rising to the roof. The square made by the pillars is depressed into the
      floor by a small amount so that you have to step down into the area where
      Aunt Wu and the guests sit and discuss the future. In the center of the
      square is a small fire. Four pillows lie at the four corners of the
      square. On the left is a small urn filled to the brim with bones. Aunt Wu
      and Aang go over to the urn.)

      Aunt Wu: This is the most reliable method of telling your fortune. The
      bones never lie. (Motioning to the urn with bones.) Go on, pick one. (Aang
      picks one and they sit down.) Now throw it on the fire. (He obeys.) The
      heat makes cracks in the bones and I read the bone cracks to tell your
      destiny.

      (Cut to a view of the fire. The camera zooms in on the bones. A huge crack
      appears and the music turns threatening.)

      Aang: Wow, that's a big crack. (The bone cracks again, almost
      disintegrating.)
      Aunt Wu (surprised): I've never seen this before. (Bone explodes, sending
      flame to the ceiling.) Oh my!

      (Cut to commercial break.)


      Scene II

      (When the show returns, the camera focuses on the fire, bits of bone
      surrounding it. Cut to Aunt Wu, as dramatic music plays in the background,
      signaling the importance of what has transpired.)

      Aunt Wu: This is incredible! You will be involved in a great battle; an
      awesome conflict between the forces of good and evil, a battle whose
      outcome will determine the fate of the whole world!
      Aang (dramatic music and the sound of fire suddenly dies away): Yeh, yeh,
      I knew that already, but did it say anything about a girl?
      Aunt Wu (confused): A girl? You want to know about love?
      Aang: Yes!
      Aunt Wu: I'm sorry, but I didn't see anything. (Aang looks downcast at
      this, and Aunt Wu looks on compassionately.) Oh look! (She slaps the side
      of her face with her hand, in a gesture of mea culpa) I must have missed
      something. (She picks up a sliver of bone, holds it over her head and
      examines its underside) Right here � it says, �trust your heart and you
      will be with the one you love.�
      Aang: Really!? (He stands and clasps his hands in a gesture of thanks)
      Thank you, Aunt Wu!

      (Aang runs out, happy. Aunt Wu shakes her head at the exiting airbender.
      Cut to exterior of Aunt Wu's building. Aang has just exited and the door
      closes quickly behind him. Appa, Katara and Sokka await him, and once
      together they all move further into the main square together. Appa's
      massive footsteps echo through the ensuing conversation.)

      Sokka: Well, now you got to see for yourselves that fortunetelling is just
      a big, stupid hoax.
      Katara: You're just saying that because you're going to make yourself
      unhappy your whole life.
      Sokka (exploding): That woman is crazy! My life will be calm, and happy
      and joyful!

      (Sokka gets more upset with each of his successive pronouncements. He ends
      by kicking a small stone off the ground which ricochets off a nearby sign
      and hits him the head, knocking him on his behind.)

      Sokka: Ow! (From o.c.) That doesn't prove anything!
      Katara (cut to Katara and Aang): Well, I liked my predictions. Certain
      things are going to turn out very well. (She holds her hands together in a
      gesture of hope.)
      Aang (knowingly): They sure are.
      Katara: Why, what did she tell you?
      Aang (smiling): Some stuff. You'll find out.

      (Cut to overhead shot of the village square. A large crowd has gathered at
      its center where a covered stage resides. Aang and his friends approach
      the crowd from the rear. Cut a view of the rear of the crowd as Aang et al
      enter. Most of the people standing around are looking up in silence. The
      Calm Man from before is one of these onlookers.)

      Katara (also looking up): What's with the sky?
      Calm Man: We are waiting for Aunt Wu to come and read the clouds to
      predict the fate of the whole village. (Camera pans left to Aang.)
      Aang (pointing up): That cloud looks like a fluffy bunny.
      Calm Man (shot widens to show more of the crowd): You better hope that's
      not a bunny � the fluffy bunny cloud forecasts doom and destruction.
      Sokka: Do you even hear yourself?

      (Calm Man looks annoyed at Sokka. Cut to another crowd member in front of
      the group.)

      Woman: The cloud reading will tell us if Mount Makapu will remain dormant
      for another year or if it will erupt.
      Calmn Man: We used to have a tradition once a year of going up the
      mountain to check the volcano ourselves, but ever since Aunt Wu moved to
      the village twenty years ago we have a tradition of not doing that.
      Sokka (incensed): I can't believe you would trust your lives to that crazy
      old woman's superstition.
      Katara (putting a hand on Sokka's shoulder): Shhhh!! She's coming!

      (Cut to shot between Katara and Sokka's heads which zooms to show an ever
      larger view of the approach of Aunt Wu and her herald. Cut to an overhead
      shot of the village square that shows the large staircase that Aunt Wu has
      just ascended. The crowd has parted to allow Aunt Wu access to the little
      stage. Cut to Aang and Katara, Aang with Momo perched on his head. The
      crowd begins to clap and cheer. Meng shows up suddenly next to Aang.

      Meng (pointing to the sky and looking at Aang): Hey Aang, doesn't that
      cloud look like a flower?
      Aang: Sure, I guess. (Camera pans left as Aang simultaneously pushes her
      off the screen.) Hey Katara, don't you think that cloud looks like a
      flower?
      Katara: Shh!!

      (Cut to Aunt Wu, now on the stage. She bows, draws breath and holds up her
      hands to the sky. Cut to a shot of an arrow shaped cloud. Cut to Aunt Wu
      examining an open book in her hands.)

      Aunt Wu: Bending arrow cloud� good crops this year, nice big harvest!
      (Happy music plays)
      Old Man: Arg! Good news! (Hugs old woman.)
      Aunt Wu: Wavy moon shape cloud� let's see� gonna be a great year for
twins.
      Twins in Green (they give each other a high five): Yes!
      Aunt Wu (dramatic music begins): And a cumulus cloud with a twisted nob
      coming off the end of it� the village will not be destroyed by the volcano
      this year!

      (Crowd goes wild. Cut to Aang and Katara at the rear of the crowd, backs
      to the camera looking at Aunt Wu on the stage.)

      Aang: Since I got you here, uh, there's something I want to tell you. I
      like you, but more than normal.

      (Cut to front view of the two, where Katara is clearly paying no attention
      to Aang. She is looking with rapt attention at the stage with Aunt Wu o.c.
      and at this point she runs o.c. up towards the stage leaving Aang alone.
      Aang looks crushed. Momo, perched on Aang's head, also drops his ears in
      sadness.)

      Aang: Never mind.

      (Cut to a shot of Aunt Wu's house that pans slowly down. Cut to a view of
      Katara knocking on Aunt Wu's door. Cut to wider shot as Aunt Wu opens the
      door.)

      Katara: Hi, Aunt Wu. Sorry to bother you.
      Aunt Wu: Anytime.
      Katara: About this man I'm supposed to marry (her cheeks flush momentarily
      in embarrassment)�is he gonna be handsome? (She clasps her hands together
      in a gesture of hope.) Oh, I hope he's tall!
      Aunt Wu: Ahh, you want another reading.
      Katara: Yes, please!

      (She follows Aunt Wu into her reading room and the door closes behind
      them. Cut to a shot of the upper half of Sokka's head as he walks through
      the village square. He is clearly in a bad mood.)

      Sokka: I can't believe all these saps. (Cut to side view where it is
      apparent that Aang follows behind him.) Someone really needs to scream
      some sense at them.
      Aang: They seem happy, Sokka.
      Sokka: Not for long. I'm gonna prove Aunt Wu's predictions are nonsense.
      (Turns and grabs nearby man.) Hey, you. I bet Aunt Wu told you to wear
      those red shoes, didn't she?
      Red Shoed Man: Yeh, she said I'd be wearing red shoes when I met my true
      love.
      Sokka: Uh-huh. And how many times have you worn those shoes since you got
      that fortune?
      Red Shoed Man: Everyday.
      Sokka (swirling red fire appears behind him, demonstrating his anger and
      frustration): THEN OF COURSE IT'S GOING TO COME TRUE!
      Red Shoed Man: Really? You think so? I'm so excited!

      (Sokka kicks a stone on the ground, it hits a duck o.c., which soon flys
      up onto Sokka's shoulders and starts to annoy him. He crawls away with the
      duck expressing its displeasure loudly. Cut to wide shot of Aunt Wu's
      reading room, where she and Katara are seated. The camera zooms in to
      them.)

      Aunt Wu: �and then you'll have your third great grandchild before quietly
      passing away in your sleep. Is that enough information for you?
      Katara: Wow, thanks Aunt Wu. (Gets up, turns to leave, but turns back.)
      Oh, wait, one more thing. How warmly should I dress tomorrow?
      Aunt Wu (flabbergasted): You want me to do a reading for that?

      (Cut to Katara with a huge and slightly scary grin on her face � she nods
      enthusiastically. Cut to Sokka and Aang, with Sokka clearly out of his
      mind.)

      Sokka: I don't care what Aunt Wu told you, you have to take a bath
      sometime!

      (Cut to a filthy old man, who smiles, grunts his acknowledgement of
      Sokka's shouting, and turns and walks away in a Pig-Pen like cloud of dirt
      and dust.)

      Aang: So, Sokka, you know some stuff about ladies, right?
      Sokka (smugly): Some stuff? You've come to the right place. (Puts his arm
      around Aang's shoulders and points at his chest in a conspiratorial
      gesture.) What can I do you for?
      Aang: Well, there's this girl�(cut to shot of Aang in the foreground, with
      Meng hiding behind a barrel at the far end of the square, stalking Aang.
      She laughs.)
      Sokka: I think I know who you mean.
      Aang: You do? And you're ok with it?
      Sokka (clearly thinking of Meng rather than Katara): Of course I am. And,
      to tell you the truth, I've been picking up the subtle vibe that she likes
      you too. (Meng visible in the background, waving her arms trying to get
      Aang's attention.)
      Aang: She does!?
      Sokka: Oh yeh, she's crazy about ya. All ya have to do now is not mess it
      up.
      Aang: Well, how do I do that?
      Sokka: The number one mistake nice guys like you make: being too nice.
      Aang (to a sound effect): You can be too nice?
      Sokka: Yup. If you want to keep her interested you have to act aloof, like
      you don't really care one way or the other.
      Aang (screen pans left to show Meng sidling up to Aang): Well�ok.
      Meng: Hey Aang, I was wondering�
      Aang: See ya later.

      (Aang quickly walks away, leaving a disappointed Meng, who makes a sad
      noise.)

      Sokka (rubbing his chin in admiration): Wow, that kid is good.

      (Cut to the door of Aunt Wu's house. It is open and Aunt Wu is pushing
      Katara out into the square.)

      Aunt Wu: �and you'll be fine as long as you've got a scarf. Bye bye now.
      Katara: Okay, okay, but, one more thing.
      Aunt Wu (exasperated): All right, what is it?
      Katara: Should I eat a mango or a papaya for breakfast tomorrow?
      Aunt Wu: Papaya! (She slams the door shut.)
      Katara: Ohhh, I hate papaya.

      (She gives the dirt at her feet a petulant kick. The shot widens to show
      Aang leaning against the wall of Aunt Wu's house, trying to look
      nonchalant.)

      Aang: Oh, hey Katara. I didn't see you there.
      Katara (walking away): Hey Aang.
      Aang (shouting after her): That's ok, I'm busy with my own stuff.

      (Aang stands there for a moment looking abashed. A duck flys near him.
      They look at each other and the duck quacks at him. Cut to Katara at a
      papaya stand.)

      Katara: Ugh. Papaya please.

      (Cut to view from the papaya stand looking at Katara. The shopkeeper's
      hand enters the frame, handing Katara a fruit. Behind Katara, a woman in
      green and a man in white and pink are talking to each other in the square.
      The shot expands to reveal Aang entering from Katara's right.)

      Aang (trying to sound cool): So�papaya.
      Katara: Uh-huh. Would you like some?
      Aang: You know me. (He picks up a fruit.) I don't really care what I eat.
      Katara: Ok then. See you later.

      (She turns and walks out of view while Aang takes a bite of the fruit. He
      chokes and spits it back up, clearly hating the taste.)

      Aang: Maybe aloof isn't my style.

      (In the background, the man in white and pink has just given something to
      the woman in green.)

      Woman in Green: Oh! A panda lilly! (She and the man hug.)
      Aang (to Momo, perched on his shoulder): Did you see that?

      (Cut to a close of the panda lilly and the shot rapidly expands to show to
      couple hugging happily. The dreamy music is rudely interrupted as Aang
      appears in between the happy � physically forcing them apart. They are
      both surprised, and he leans over them to point at the flower the woman's
      hand.)

      Aang: Excuse me. Where can a guy find one of those things?

      (Cut to a view of a path leading towards the mountain. Then cut to a shot
      of Aang hopping up rocks on the side of the mountain.)

      Sokka (from o.c.): I can't believe you're dragging me all the way up here
      for a stupid flower.
      Aang: Not just any flower � a panda lilly. I've seen it in action and boy
      does it work.
      Sokka (climbing into frame from below): Flowers are fine once you're
      married, but at this early stage it's critical that you maintain maximum
      aloofness.
      Aang: But my heart is telling me to get this flower, and Aunt Wu said if I
      trusted my heart I would be with the one I love.
      Sokka: What? Don't tell me you believe in that stuff too.
      Aang: Well, Aunt Wu hasn't been wrong yet. Why should she be wrong about
      love? (Pointing up.) There, on the rim!

      (Cut to shot of Aang on the rim of the volcano. The panda lilies dot the
      rim. A fiery glow emanates from the caldera below. He picks up a flower
      and sniffs it. His eyes pop open though when he looks down into the
      volcano. The caldera is full of lava.)

      Aang: Oh no! Aunt Wu was wrong.

      (He drops the flower into the lava. It burns instantly. Cut to break.)



      Scene III

      (When the show returns, both Sokka and Aang are on the rim looking down in
      alarm.)

      Sokka: Those people all think they're safe. We've got to warn'em.
      Aang: There's no time to walk. (He opens up his glider.) Grab on. (He
      grabs Sokka and they launch into the air.)
      Sokka: Aaahhh!

      (The pair glide quickly down to the village and land in the square. Cut
      the two walking up to Katara, who is waiting outside of Aunt Wu's door.)

      Aang: Hi, Katara.
      Katara: Can you believe she won't let me in? And after all the business
      I've given her?
      Aang: But, she doesn't even charge.
      Katara: I know, but still.
      Sokka: Well, we have other things to worry about. Aunt Wu was wrong about
      the volcano.
      Katara: Sokka, you tried to convince me she was wrong before. It's going
      to take an awful lot to change my min �

      (She is cut off by the sound of the mountain erupting to life. Cut to
      Katara and Aang looking up at the mountain, which suddenly has a full
      plume of ash and smoke stretching to the heavens.)

      Katara: Oh, no!

      (Cut to overhead shot of the square, showing the three surrounded by many
      villagers, including the Calm Man.)

      Sokka: Everyone! That volcano is gonna blow any second. Aunt Wu was wrong!
      Girl in Crowd: Yeh, yeh, we know you don't believe in Aunt Wu, �Mr.
      Science and Reason Lover.�
      Katara: If you won't listen to him, maybe you'll listen to me. I want to
      believe Aunt Wu and her predictions as much as you do, but my brother and
      Aang saw the lava with their own eyes.
      Calm Man: Well I heard Aunt Wu's prediction with my own ears.

      (Aang airbends himself up onto the roof of Aunt Wu's house.)

      Aang: Please listen to us! You are all in danger! And we have to get out
      of here. You can't rely on Aunt Wu's prediction. You have to take fate
      into your own hands.
      Sokka (another explosion occurs): Look! (Pointing to the mountain.) Can
      your fortunetelling explain that?
      Man in Crowd: Can your science explain why it rains?
      Sokka (annoyed): Yes! Yes, it can!

      (The crowd is not convinced. Cut to overhead shot showing the crowd
      dispersing back to their homes.)

      Katara: They just won't listen to reason. (Aang flies back down to them.)
      Aang: But they will listen to Aunt Wu.
      Sokka: I know, that's the problem.
      Aang: Well, it's about to become the solution. We're taking fate in our
      own hands. First, I need to borrow Aunt Wu's cloud reading book.

      (Cut to a shot of Aunt Wu's door. Katara and Sokka stand guard with guilty
      expressions on their faces. Pan up to see Aang and Momo entering Aunt Wu's
      house via the topmost balcony. Cut to a view of her reading room, where
      Aang is now searching. Momo makes a few chittering noises.)

      Aang (whispering): Shh� we don't want anyone to hear us.

      (The polished metal gong in front of Aang now shows Meng's reflection, an
      expression of surprise on her face. Aang sees the reflection and jumps,
      startled. He turns and faces her.)

      Aang: Oh! I didn't see you there.
      Meng: You don't like me. Do you? (She is sad, and her enormous hair braids
      wilt to match her mood.)
      Aang: Of course I like you.
      Meng: But not the way I like you.
      Aang: Oh. I guess not.
      Meng: It's ok. It's just really hard when you like someone, but they don't
      think of you that way.
      Aang (sadly): I know what you mean.
      Meng: She's beautiful, by the way.
      Aang (he blushes): Huh?
      Meng: That water tribe girl. I can see why you like her so much. (Counting
      each reason on her fingers.) She's sweet, she's a bender, and her hair
      seems so manageable. (She tries to mash her braids down and fails at this
      last reason. She looks crushed.)
      Aang: Don't worry. You're gonna meet a great guy who's gonna completely
      fall for you. I know it. (He puts his hands on her shoulders.)
      Meng: Thanks. (He turns to leave.) Wait! Don't you want this? (She hands
      Aang the cloud reading book which Meng had in her robe.)
      Aang: How did you know?
      Meng (nervously playing with her fingers): I've kind of been stalking you�
      heh!
      Aang (blushing): Oh, thanks. I guess.

      (Cut to shot of Appa flying through the clouds with Aang and Katara on his
      back.)

      Aang: Clouds are made of water and air so between the two of us we ought
      to be able to bend them into any shape we want.
      Katara (reading Aunt Wu's book): I found it. The symbol for volcanic doom.

      (Cut to Aang and Katara bending the clouds. Below, the villagers look up
      to see the clouds shifting. Sokka brings Aunt Wu over to her stage. He
      points to the sky.)

      Sokka: Aunt Wu, look! Something is happening in the clouds.
      Aunt Wu: That's very strange. It shouldn't� Oh my!

      (Cut to a view of the new skull-shaped cloud that Aang and Katara have
      created. Cut to a view of the mountain spewing smoke into the air. The
      screen pans down to the village square. Aang is addressing the crows.)

      Aang: We can still save the village if we act fast. Sokka has a plan.
      Sokka: Lava is gonna flow downhill to this spot. If we can dig a deep
      enough trench we can channel all the lava away from the village to the
      river.
      Aang: If any of you are earthebenders come with me.

      (Cut to shot of the twins in green from earlier in the episode.)

      Twin in Green #1: I'm an earthbender!
      Twin in Green #2: I'm not!
      Sokka: Everybody else grab a shovel (explosion sounds)� come on, we've
      gotta hurry!

      (Crowd disperses like lightning. Cut to shot of the ground outside of
      town. Appa and the townspeople labor to dig the trench, using both
      earthbending and manual means. Another explosion heralds a cut to the
      mountain again, now spewing lava.)

      Sokka: Dig faster! Dig faster!

      (The earthbending twin finally connects the trench to the river.)

      Aang: Everyone needs to evacuate! We'll come for you when it's safe!

      (Everyone runs. Cut to the volcano. The view pans down to the group. It is
      now precipitating ash. The scene cuts to a view of the village gate. Lava
      engulfs it and it begins to burn away. The world has taken on the eerie
      red tinge of the lava, which now passes through the cemetery, consuming
      headstones as it flows downhill. The lava reaches the trench and begins to
      fill rapidly, its progress temporarily halted. Cut to the group on the
      safe side of the trench.)

      Katara: It's too much! It's gonna overflow!

      (Another explosion rocks the village. Burning ejecta begins to rain down
      in addition to the ash. Katara and Sokka begin to run, but turn to see
      Aang hasn't moved. A huge boulder falls out of the sky and lands in the
      trench, exploding. Cut to Aang rushing forward with a furious warcry. He
      launches himself into the air and begins to airbend. As the lava begins to
      overflow, Aang blows the lava straight up, rather than allowing to advance
      on the village. Finally, he draws in a mighty intake of breath and expels
      it, airbending it as it exits, cooling all the lava to stone. Aang relaxes
      and assumes a meditation pose, calming himself after the massive exertion.
      Cut to Katara and Sokka watching in awe, the mountain still visibly
      erupting, but no longer threatening the village.)

      Sokka: Man, sometimes I forget what powerful bender (Katara's expression
      instantly changes at this, remembering Aunt Wu's words) that kid is.
      Katara: Wait, what did you just say?
      Sokka: Nothing, just that Aang is one powerful bender.

      (Cut to Katara's and Sokka's view of Aang. His figure is wreathed in red
      glow of the lava still seething behind the stone shield Aang has created.)

      Katara: I suppose he is�

      (Cut a day shot of the volcano, smoking, but no longer erupting. Clearly
      some time has passed between this scene and the last. Cut to a view of the
      square where Aunt Wu and the people, including the Calm Man, have
      assembled. Aang stands in front of Aunt Wu to address her, offering her
      back the cloud book he �borrowed.�)

      Aang (sheepishly looking at the ground): By the way, we kind of borrowed
      your book.
      Aunt Wu: So you messed with the clouds did you!

      (She grabs the book in anger and Aang cringes. In the background, Katara
      looks guilty, while Sokka smiles and points at her, indicating that she
      was in on the cloud manipulation too.)

      Aunt Wu (begins to laugh): Very clever!
      Sokka: No offense, but I hope this taught everyone a lesson about not
      relying too much on fortunetelling.
      Calm Man: But Aunt Wu predicted the village wouldn't be destroyed, and it
      wasn't. She was right, after all.
      Sokka (getting right in the Calm Man's face): I hate you.
      Katara (taking Sokka by the shoulders): It's ok, Sokka. Everything's gonna
      be all right.

      (Cut to Aunt Wu and Aang, who were watching Sokka and the Calm Man. Aang
      turns to Aunt Wu.)

      Aang: Can I ask you something?
      Aunt Wu: Of course, honey.
      Aang: You didn't really see love in my fortune, did you? You just told me
      what I wanted to hear.
      Aunt Wu: I'll tell you a little secret, young Airbender. Just as you
      reshaped those clouds, you have the power to reshape your own destiny.

      (Aang smiles. Cut to shot of Appa and the crowd. Katara is at Appa's
      reigns. Meng stands in front of Appa.)

      Katara: Goodbye everyone! It was so nice to meet you! Take care, Meng.
      Meng (waving goodbye): Take care! (Appa turns away, cut to Meng's face,
      whose smile disappears and is replaced by a frown.) Floozy.

第十四回
卦师

看哪！
它在嘲笑我们
今天晚餐就是你了，哪里跑？
嘿，鱼线怎么没了？
哦，索卡，我以为你不用了呢
啊，都被你缠乱了
才不是乱缠的，这可是我认真编的
卡塔拉，我知道你原来的那条项链弄丢了
所以我亲手给你做了条新的
我谢你啊，安昂，我太喜欢了
太好了，安昂，你不用去拯救世界了，
干脆开个珠宝店，做点小买卖得了
别嫉妒，神通可是多才多艺的哦~
小样的，还敢挑衅我
我看上去怎么样？
不论是脖子还是身材，呵呵，都很棒啊~
好肉麻，好肉麻啊，有人恋爱喽~
我...这个....
索卡，别取笑他
安昂只是个好朋友
是个贴心的好玩伴，
就像模模一样
多谢夸奖
看哪，有个人被鸭嘴熊袭击了
山上的朋友们你们好吗？今儿天气不错吧
叫两声，吓唬吓唬它，它就会跑了
别听他的，赶紧装死，熊对死的没兴趣
噢，差点就被你打到了，呵呵
赶紧往山下跑啊，往树上爬
照熊的肚子上来一拳
然后跑“之字型”，它就追不上你了
别担心，不会有事的
蠢熊，休得猖狂
嗯，午饭有着落了
幸亏你碰到我们了
多谢了，不过其实一切仅在掌握之中
勿须担忧，吴妈 说我此行一帆风顺
胡妈？
（英语小幽默，呵呵）
不是，是吴妈。她是我们村的算命师
能算出你得将来哟
哇，那得试试
所以你才如此镇定
她明摆式算错了嘛！顺利啥啊，你差点没被熊给吃了
差点，可是是没被吃啊。呵呵，后会有期了
哦，对了，吴妈说如果我遇到其他旅人，
就把这个给他们
我应该去和吴妈学学算卦之术，肯定很好玩
算了吧，算命的都是骗人的
猜猜是什么，呵呵，是把伞
还真灵啊
肯定是瞎蒙的，我才不信呢
反正谁被浇，谁自己心里最清楚
这么说我也会算卦呢，这天都阴了半天了
就认个输吧，认了就让你躲会儿雨
看，我也会算命了
毛毛雨还会一直下下去...下去...去...去
灵验了吧
索卡，你好象没这个天赋
吴妈早已恭候多时了
真的吗？
我叫“梦”，是吴妈的帮手
幸会啊
幸会
我这就去给你们沏点茶，
再拿点吴妈特制的豆香松饼给你们吃吧
有劳了，我要松饼
稍等片刻，请问你什么名字
安昂
正好和我的名字押韵呢，呵呵，你的耳朵还真大呢
嗯...我...
别谦虚嘛，耳朵是挺大的
（终于有人说别人耳朵打了，索卡太开心了）
安昂，真得很高兴见到你，真的
我也是
真不敢相信我们回来这儿听人瞎掰
索卡，别那么死脑筋嘛
世界上有些事你是无法解释的
能够知道你的未来不是件很妙的事吗？
有松饼吃才是真格的
我说“梦”啊，吴妈说我就要遇到我的真爱了
他将送我一束稀有的熊猫百合
真是太浪漫了
不知我的真爱会不会也送给我一束呢？
他一定会的
那就是吴妈给你算的未来夫君吗？耳朵是挺大的
快吃吧，这个很好吃的
欢迎你们，年轻的旅人
谁先进来算呢？别害羞嘛
那我先来吧
好吃，好吃
我对这个不感冒
那个...你说他们在后面会谈些什么呢？
那还用说，肯定是些无聊的事
爱情啊，要嫁给谁啦，将来会生多少个小孩啦
嗯...是...是挺无聊的
那个，我先去趟卫生间啊
你的手真滑啊，平时用润肤膏吗？
我用一种特制的“海草霜”，老好用了
你要用的话，我可以给你点
那个，我的爱情线怎么样？
你将要有一场轰轰烈烈的恋爱，你未来的夫君是个...
再说的详细点
他是一个非常强的御术师，功夫了得
看来厕所上的很爽嘛
是啊，我在那里的时候...
我可不想听你方便的事
下一个谁来？
好吧，我就勉为其难吧
你的未来充满了挣扎和痛苦
它们大多数都是你自己造成的
还没看我的手相呢，你咋知道的？
哪还用看你的手相，你的命运全都写在你的脸上了
下一个你来吧，跟我来
这种卦算得最准了
骨头是不会撒谎的
来吧，挑一根
把它扔进火里
热量会使骨头开裂
通过解读裂开的形式可以预见你的命运
哇，这裂缝还真大呢
我之前从来也没有见过这样的现象
天哪
你的命运...真是难以置信，
你将会卷入一场大战
那将是一场正与邪的较量
这场战争的胜者将决定整个世界的命运
这些我早就知道了
那上面有没有提到过一个女孩？
一个女孩？
-你是要问姻缘啊？
-没错
很抱歉，我没看到
看！我可能是漏掉了些东西
在这儿...这上面说....只要你听从
心灵的召唤就会找到你的爱
真的吗？太谢谢你了，吴妈
现在明白了吧，算命完全是胡编乱造的
你这么说是因为你不能接受你一生不幸的事实罢了
那个吴妈简直就是个疯子，
我的生活一定会平安幸福快乐！
这个说明不了什么
我求的卦可是不错哩
某些事要柳暗花明了
那时当然
你怎么知道？她给你怎么算的？
好事。不久你就会知道的
他们都盯着天干什么？
我再等吴妈来算云势
她会云彩的形状来预测整个村子的运势
那朵云毛茸茸的，像个小兔子
可别像什么小兔子
兔状云预示着厄运和灾难
你们就不能有点主见吗？
通过云势，我们可以看出 “马卡布”火山
今年会爆发还是依旧休眠
我们原来的传统是，每年都要亲自上火山去检查
但自从吴妈搬到我们村以后，
年来我们都没有再去检查过
真不敢相信，你们居然把自己生命托付给那个疯婆子
嘘，她来了
嘿，安昂，看那朵云，像不像一朵花
还真像
嘿，卡塔拉，你看那朵云像不像一朵花
嘘~
“箭矢云”
今年利兴农，将会大丰收
哇~太好了
“摇月云”...让我看看
双胞胎将大吉大利
太棒了
“堆积云”后面还带着一个奇怪的把，这个...
今年火山不会喷发，咱们村子依然太平
正好你在这儿，我有件事想跟你说
我喜欢你，不是一般的喜欢
算了
你好，吴妈，抱歉打扰你
随时欢迎
之前您给我算过我的夫君
我想知道他帅吗？希望他是个大高个儿
嗯，你是想再算一卦？
是啊，拜托了
这群笨人，看来得有人出来好好点化点化他们
看他们多幸福啊，索卡
要不了多久，我一定要戳穿吴妈的谎言
嘿，我说，是吴妈让你穿红鞋的，对吧？
没错，她说只有我穿红鞋，就能遇见我的真爱
嗯，从那之后这双红鞋你都穿了多少次了？
我每天都穿
那可不呗，这么做迟早会灵验的
（瞎猫早晚会撞上死耗子）
真的吗？你也这么想？谢您吉言
之后，在你安然辞世前，还能抱到第三个重孙子
这下该满意了吧？
我谢你啊，吴妈
嗯，等等，还有一件事，我明天该穿什么好呢？
这也要算？
我不管吴妈怎么跟你说，你起码也应该洗个澡啊
那个，索卡，想跟你请教几个关于女生的问题
那你可真是问对人了
你想问点啥？
那个，有个女孩...
我知道你说谁了
真的吗？你觉得我和她合适吗？
当然了。跟你说实话吧，
经我仔细观察，她对你也有点意思呢
真的？
没错，她正为你痴狂哩
你现在要做的就是千万别搞砸了
那么，我该做点啥好呢？
像你这种好好先生，经常犯的错误就是，脾气太好了
不能太好说话了？
说得没错。如果你想引起她的注意
就得保持点距离，距离产生美嘛
那好吧，我试试
嘿，安昂，我在想...
回头再说
哇，学得还真快
听我的，再配条条围巾你就没治了。再见吧，再见吧
好的，好的，还得问一下
好吧，你还要问啥？
我明天早饭该吃芒果好，还是吃木瓜？
木瓜
啊~最不愿意吃木瓜了
嘿，卡塔拉，没看到你在这儿
嘿，安昂
没关系，反正我也有事要忙
嗯，我想买木瓜
这么说...吃木瓜？
嗯，想来点吗？
你也知道的，我对吃的无所谓
那就这样吧，回见
看来耍酷我并不在行
啊，这不是熊猫百合吗？
你看到了吗？
打搅一下，请问这花在哪能找到？
真不敢相信，你居然为了摘朵破花拉我到这儿
那可不是一般的花，那可是 熊猫百合
把这个花送给她准管用
你要是求婚的话，送花倒是没错
但是鉴于你现在仍处于初级阶段，
尽量耍酷才是最有效的方法
但是直觉告诉我应该找到那个花
吴妈说只要我相信我听从内心的召唤
我就能找到我的真爱
不是吧，别跟我说你也信这套
吴妈到现在也没算错卦，听她的错不了
看哪，就在山崖上
天哪，看来吴妈这回算错了
那些村民还以为会安全呢，咱们得去警告他们
现在走回去来不及了，抓住我
嘿，卡塔拉
你能相信吗？她居然不让我进去了，
这阵子就我常光顾她来着
可她都没管你要过钱啊
那倒是，不过那也说不过去啊
赶紧说正经事吧
吴妈关于火山的预言是错的
索卡, 你之前也试图说明她是错的
没有真凭实据，你可别想说服我...
天哪，不好
大家听好了，火山马上就要爆发了，吴妈的预言错了
我就知道你不相信吴妈，“科学先生”
你们不相信他，也不相信我吗？
我也想相信吴妈，想相信她的那些预言
但是，我哥哥和安昂都亲眼看到了熔岩
我可是亲耳听到吴妈说的火山不会爆发
拜托了，听我一次不行吗，现在这儿太危险了
咱们得赶紧离开这儿
吴妈的预言太不靠谱了
你们应该自己掌握命运
看，你们的卦师能解释那个吗？
科学能解释为什么会下雨吗？
那还用说
他们现在什么话都听不进去
他们只听吴妈的
我知道，真让人头疼啊
现在该是解决麻烦的时候了
我们要自己掌握命运
不过在那之前，我们需要搞到吴妈的那本“云势谱”
嘘~可别被别人发现了
噢，噢，我没看见你在那儿
你不喜欢我，是吗？
那怎么可能，我当然喜欢你
但并不像我喜欢你那样
我想是吧
没关系，有时喜欢一个人真的很难
你喜欢他，可他却对你没感觉
你说的话我感同身受
-她真的很漂亮
-嗯？
我是说那个水善族的女孩，难怪你那么喜欢她
她人好，还是个御水师，她的头发还那么柔顺
别担心，你一定会遇到你的白马王子的
-一定会的
-谢谢
等等，你不是在找这个吗？
你怎么会知道
其实我一直都有留意你
那...谢谢了
云是由水和空气组成的
所以我们可以用御气术和御水术任意变换它的形状
找到了，这就是火山厄运的云势
吴妈，快看哪！云势发生了变化
太奇怪了，不应该啊....天哪
如果我们赶快的话，还能拯救这个村庄。
索卡有个计划
岩浆将会顺山留下到这儿
如果我们在这里挖一条足够深的渠道，
岩浆就不会漫进村庄，而会向河流去
是御土师的跟我来
-我是御土师
-我不是
（不是你吱什么声啊）
其他人拿上铁锹
加油，咱们得快点
快点挖！快点挖！
大家赶快撤离，等安全之后咱们再汇合
岩浆太多了，就要溢出来了
天哪，有时候差点忘了这小子的御术有多么高强了
你刚才说什么？
没啥，就是说安昂是个很强的御术师
不会吧，难道他...
对不起，我们借了你的书用了一下
那云势是你们搞出来的吧
哈，哈，你还真聪明
无意冒犯，不过我向大家
通过今天的事也应该明白了吧
不要任何事都依赖算命来解决
吴妈之前预言过，村子不会被毁的
你看这不是好好的吗
你看，她还是没算错嘛
恨死你了
没事的，索卡，一切都会变好的
问您一个问题，行吗？
随便问，亲爱的
其实，您并没有算到我的姻缘吧
你只是告诉我想要听到的
小御气师，告诉你一个小秘密
就像你能改变云的形状一样，
你也一样可以掌控你的命运
再见了，大家！很高兴能认识你们。
梦，保重了
保重
你个烂妞~
（女人啊，汗|||）

水善国
土强国
火烈国
气和国
很久以前，这四大国和谐共处
然而，烈火国发起的战争结束了和平
只有同时掌握四种元素的降世神通才能结束战争
然而在大家最需要他的时候，他却消失了
年后，我和哥哥发现了转世的降世神通，
他是个御气师，名叫“安昂”
尽管他的御气术着实厉害
在拯救苍生之前，他要学的还有很多
但是我坚信
安昂 能拯救这个世界
