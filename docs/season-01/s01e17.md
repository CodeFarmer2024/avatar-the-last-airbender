      Scene I

      (Opening shot of the roof of a building, screen pans up to reveal a small
      group of people seated on benches. It is night. Aang, Katara and Sokka sit
      on the first bench to the left. Some children kneel on the ground in front
      of the benches. They are all listening to a man sitting in front of the
      fire that burns in the center of the gathering.)

      Storyteller (from o.c. at first as the camera pans up): So travelers, the
      next time you think you hear a strange large bird talking, take a closer
      look, it might not be a giant parrot, but a flying man! A member of a
      secret group of air walkers who laugh at gravity and laugh at those bound
      to the earth by it!

      (Cut to Aang, smiling.)

      Aang: Aren&#x27;t airbender stories the best?
      Katara: Was it realistic? Was that how it was back then?
      Aang: I laugh at gravity all the time. Haha! Gravity.

      (Cut to a wider shot of the three on the bench. Suddenly a pair of hands
      holding an open hat appear in front of Sokka. The hands shake the hat and
      the jungle of coins is heard.)

      Storyteller: Jingle, jingle!

      (Sokka searches his coast, but when he opens his hands there is only some
      lint and a bug. The bugs legs wiggle a few times, accompanied by a sound
      effect. Cut to wide shot of the three seated on the log, the storyteller
      in front of them.)

      Sokka: Sorry!
      Storyteller: Aww. Cheapskates!

      (Aang runs over to the storyteller who is facing another audience member
      as he seeks more donations.)

      Aang: Hey thanks for the story!
      Storyteller (thrusting hat at Aang without looking at him): Tell it to the
      cap, boy!

      (A copper piece falls on the ground, which Momo picks up and deposits in
      the cap. The storyteller pats Momo.)

      Storyteller: Aw, much obliged little bat thing!
      Aang (Momo climbing back up to his shoulder): It means a lot to hear
      airbender stories. It must have been hundred years ago your great grandpa
      met them.
      Storyteller: What are you prattling about child? Great grand-pappy saw the
      air walkers last week!

      (View slides over to a very old man who waves at Aang.)

      Great Grand-Pappy: Heya!

      (Cut to a daytime sky shot of clouds rushing by. The camera pans up to
      reveal Appa&#x27;s underside, the sun above him as he flies. Cut to a side view
      as Appa flies just above puffy white clouds, snow capped mountains in the
      distance.)

      Aang: Hey, we&#x27;re almost at the Northern Air Temple! This is where they had
      the championships for sky bison polo.
      Katara (sitting down next to Sokka): Do you think we&#x27;ll really find
      airbenders?
      Sokka (whittling): You want me to be like you, or totally honest?
      Katara (folding her arms): Are you saying I&#x27;m a liar?
      Sokka: I&#x27;m saying you&#x27;re an optimist. Same thing basically.

      (Cut to Aang, looking ahead and smiling.)

      Aang: Hey guys, look at this!

      (Cut to shot just near Appa, who flies them all away from the camera
      towards what is obviously the Northern Air Temple. It sits atop a sheer
      peak similar to its sister temple down south. Unlike that temple, however,
      there are people or things flying around this one. Cut to a closer shot of
      the temple. Smoke rises in lazy pillars from a couple places among the
      spires. Around the temple fly many gliders. Cut back to Aang, Katara in
      the background. Aang&#x27;s smile turns to a slight frown.)

      Katara: Huh! They really are airbenders!
      Aang (leaning back and folding his arms unhappily): No, they&#x27;re not.
      Sokka (appearing in the far background with Momo and pointing ahead): What
      do you mean they&#x27;re not? Those guys are flying!
      Aang (from o.c. as the camera returns to a shot of the temple and its
      gliders): Gliding maybe, but not flying. You can tell by the way they
      move. They&#x27;re not airbending. Those people have no spirit.

      (As he finishes, Katara and Sokka almost get their heads taken off by a
      glider as it passes over their heads. The glider pilot laughs. Cut to a
      close up of the glider. A teenage boy wearing amber goggles and seated in
      a glider built out of a wheelchair laughs and wheels his craft around for
      another pass at Appa. Cut back to the kids.)

      Katara (pointing to the glider): I don&#x27;t know, Aang. That kid seems pretty
      spirited!

      (The wheelchair glider makes another pass. Aang looks at him and gets a
      competitive look on his face. He jumps into the air, unfolds his glider
      and takes off. The other gliders now fly in formation around Appa. Katara
      falls backward, crashing into Sokka.)

      Sokka: We better find some solid ground before it finds us!

      (Cut to Appa landing gracefully on one of the temple&#x27;s outer terraces.
      Then cut back to the boy glider, still laughing. He soars upward, Aang
      coming into the frame beneath him, an unhappy expression on his face. Aang
      flies upward as well and comes up just behind the his target. Shift to an
      overhead shot of some Air Temple residents watching the game of �tag�
      going on in the sky from the terrace where Appa landed.)

      Audience Member: Go Teo! Show that bald kid how it&#x27;s done!

      (Back in the sky, Aang continues the pursuit. Teo hits his brakes, loops
      backwards and ends us behind Aang. They twirl around each other in a
      controlled dive. Cut to a side view where it is clear that the gliders are
      neck and neck with each other.)

      Teo: Hey there! You&#x27;re pretty good.
      Aang: Yeh, I know. But I can do more than fancy gliding!

      (Aang breaks his descent, turns and shoots straight upward. He comes back
      to the one of temple&#x27;s towers, let&#x27;s go of his glider, and starts running
      along the side of the tower. Then he produces an air scooter, jumps on it
      and rides it along the outside wall of the tower, his glider still running
      along side of him. He lets the air scooter die and then jumps back on his
      glider and soars back into the sky. Cut back to Teo, who is impressed.)

      Teo: Wow! I don&#x27;t think I can do that! But here&#x27;s a good one�

      (He releases a cord on his glider and a cylinder on the back of his glider
      begins to leave a trail of thick grey smoke. Teo manipulates his glider
      through loops and arcs, leaving the grey trail behind him. Cut to a view
      from the audience down on the Air Temple terrace. Teo has made a picture
      of Aang&#x27;s face, arrow and all, with a sour expression. The crowd laughs.
      Cut back to Aang on his glider, Teo coming up beside him.)

      Teo: What do you think?
      Aang (clearly not enthused): It&#x27;s great.

      (Aang lands next to Katara and Sokka, folding his glider. Teo lands his
      glider right behind, skidding only a bit before he applies his hand break
      and come to a stop. A bunch of kids come up and detach the glider from his
      wheelchair. He then wheels over to Aang and his friends.)

      Teo: Hey! You&#x27;re a REAL airbender! You must be the Avatar! That&#x27;s amazing!
      I, I, I&#x27;ve heard stories about you.
      Aang (looking embarrassed but happy): Thanks.
      Sokka: Wow! This glider chair is incredible!

      (Two girls bring the glider setup back for Sokka to inspect.)

      Teo: If you think this is good, wait until you see the other stuff my Dad
      designed.

      (He begins to wheel away, Sokka and the others following. Cut to an
      overhead shot of the three moving with their new friend through the huge
      main gate of the temple. Cut to a view from inside the entrance as the
      walk in. When they reach the main chamber, it is quite unlike that seen in
      �The Southern Air Temple.� This room is dominated by a jumble of
      steam-powered machinery with many wheels, gears and pipes. It is not
      pretty. A beautiful statue of an airbender monk (who looks somewhat like
      Gyatso) is seen in a recessed portico in the wall, but it too seems dirty
      and befouled as does the rest of the room. Shafts of sunlight do filter
      in, but the steam and dust make it look shadowy.)

      Sokka (running forward): Wow!
      Teo (proudly): Yeh, my Dad is the mastermind behind this whole place!
      Everything&#x27;s powered by hot air. It even pumps hot air currents outside to
      give us a lift when we&#x27;re gliding.

      (As he speaks a woman walks over to cage which she gets into. She pulls a
      rope and steam power lifts the cage up to a higher level where she exits.)

      Aang: This place is unbelievable.
      Teo: Yeh, it&#x27;s great isn&#x27;t it?
      Aang: No, just unbelievable.

      (Aang&#x27;s walks out of the frame, clearly saddened by what he has seen.)

      Katara: Aang used to come here a long time ago. I think he&#x27;s a little
      shocked it&#x27;s so� different.
      Sokka: So better!

      (Cut to Katara walking over to Aang in another part of the room. The
      Avatar is looking at a mural. Cut to the mural. It was surely once
      breathtakingly beautiful. Now, it is gritty and dirty. Worse, many of the
      figures and shapes in the mural have been destroyed since many pipes now
      and enter and exit the wall here.)

      Aang (sadly from o.c. as the camera pans the mural): This is supposed to
      be the history of my people.

      (Katara walks over and puts a hand on his shoulder, but he walks away over
      to a huge statue that once had a fountain attached to it. Now the fountain
      basin is full of green industrial looking effluence that bubbles and
      spirits. The statue then emits a cloud of black smoke from its mouth,
      scaring Aang. Katara comes up behind him.)

      Aang (as the smoke erupts from the statue): Ugh!
      Katara: I&#x27;m sure some parts of the temple are still the same.

      (Fade to some time later where we see a long shot of the kids and Teo
      walking across a narrow, suspended pathway from the main temple to a
      satellite temple building. Cut the four now inside the satellite building.
      They are in the main courtyard, which looks untouched. Airbender statues
      still reside here.)

      Aang: It&#x27;s nice to see even one part of the temple that isn&#x27;t ruined.

      (Cut to Aang and Katara staring up at a huge recessed statue of an
      airbender monk. Suddenly, from o.c.)

      Voice: Look out!

      (The statue disintegrates as a wrecking ball smashes through it. Aang and
      Katara fall backward with flying debris and dust. Everyone coughs. As the
      dust settles, many figures can be seen through the hole the wrecking ball
      just created. One of them walks forward, a middle aged man with a bald
      head and weird, patches of pointy hair on either side of his head. His
      right eye has a red monocle. He wears a green tunic mostly covered by the
      white smock or apron of an artisan.)

      The Mechanist: What the doodle! Don&#x27;t you know enough to stay away from
      construction sites? We have to make room for the bathhouse!
      Aang (assuming an airbending stance): Do you know what you did? You just
      destroyed something sacred! For a stupid bathhouse!
      The Mechanist (waving a hand in front of nose suggestively): Well, people
      around here are starting to stink.
      Aang (pointing at the Mechanist): This whole place stinks!

      (Aang strikes the ground with his staff, sending a gale back through the
      hole in the wall. Cut to a long shot of the outside of the satellite
      temple building. The wrecking ball and its entire rig are blown off the
      building&#x27;s rock foundation and falls into the crevices below. Cut to a
      shot from underneath the falling rig, where the rig seems to fall right
      into the camera. Fade to commercial break.)

      Scene II

      (When the show returns, a brief opening shot of the temple&#x27;s exterior,
      festooned with smoke, is replaced by a return to Aang&#x27;s showdown with the
      Mechanist.)

      Aang: This is a sacred temple! You can&#x27;t treat it this way. I&#x27;ve seen it
      when the monks were here. I know what it&#x27;s supposed to be like.
      The Mechanist: The monks? But you&#x27;re 12!
      Teo: Dad, he&#x27;s the Avatar. He used to come here a hundred years ago.
      Aang (advancing on the Mechanist with each question): What are you doing?
      Who said you could be here?
      The Mechanist (turning away): Hmmm� doing here�A long time ago, but not a
      hundred years, my people became refugees after a terrible flood (he
      gestures for effect to show the size of the flood, then stands behind his
      son&#x27;s wheelchair). My infant son, Teo, was badly hurt and lost his mother.
      (Sniffling to hold back tears) I needed somewhere to rebuild and I
      stumbled across this place. Couldn&#x27;t believe it! Everywhere pictures of
      flying people. But empty! Nobody home! Then I came across these fan like
      contraptions!

      (He puts his hands out and extends his arms as if they were wings and
      makes flying motions across the courtyard for emphasis. He stops in front
      of Aang, who still looks angry.)

      Aang: Our gliders.
      The Mechanist: Yes, little light flying machines. They gave me an idea.
      Build a new life for my son, in the air! Then everyone would be on equal
      ground, so to speak! We&#x27;re just in the process of improving upon what&#x27;s
      already here and after all, isn&#x27;t that what nature does?

      (Cut back to Aang, still unhappy. His friends are teary eyed behind him at
      the Mechanist&#x27;s story.)

      Aang: Nature knows where to stop.
      The Mechanist (looking through the hole in the wall he just created): I
      suppose that&#x27;s true. Unfortunately, progress has a way of getting away
      from us. (He looks down in some sadness, then lifts his head back up to
      look at something o.c.) Look at the time!

      (Cut to a view of a three candles burning brightly on a stone pedestal.
      Each of the three candles is separated neatly into different sections.
      Next to the pedestal a large mallet rests, head down. Then cut back to the
      Mechanist turning to speak to a scribe behind him.)

      The Mechanist: Come the pulley system must be oiled before dark.
      Sokka (approaching the candles): Wait, how can you tell the time from that
      thing? The notches all look the same.
      The Mechanist: The candle will tell us. Watch.

      (The candle flame snaps four times in a row.)

      Sokka: You put spark powder in the candle!
      The Mechanist: Four flashes, so it&#x27;s exactly four hours past midday, or,
      as I call it, four o&#x27;candle!

      (Sokka laughs. Cut to a frontal shot of the Mechanist, pleased that Sokka
      is interested.)

      The Mechanist: If you like that, wait till you see my finger safe knife
      sharpener! (He holds up his left hand. Three of the fingers are made of
      wood. He detaches them and tosses them to Sokka.) Only took me three tries
      to get it right!
      Sokka (after catching the fingers): Aaahhh!
      The Mechanist: Follow me!

      (Sokka and the others run after The Mechanist, leaving Katara, Aang and
      Teo alone.)

      Teo: Hey Aang, I want to show you something.

      (Fade to a long, overhead shot of the three walking deep in the bowels of
      the Air Temple.)

      Aang: I just can&#x27;t get over it. There&#x27;s not a single thing that&#x27;s the
same.
      Teo (stopping and scooping up a little black and white striped hermit
      crab): I don&#x27;t know about that. The Temple might be different, but the
      creatures that live here are probably direct descendents of the ones that
      lived here a long time ago.
      Katara: You&#x27;re right. They&#x27;re kind of keepers of the temples origins.

      (Teo gave the crab to Katara, who now passes it to Aang. He smiles.)

      Teo (from o.c.): Besides, there&#x27;s one part of the temple that hasn&#x27;t
      changed at all.

      (Fade to the group walking down a long corridor of the Temple. Huge Air
      Nomad swirls are built into mosaics in the floor. Camera pans down to
      where they all stand in front of a door. Then cut to a view from behind
      the three showing a clear shot of the door. It is huge, made of wood, and
      it is dominated in the center by a woodcut comprised of three wooden air
      symbols protruding from its surface and which are arranged in a triangular
      pattern. The symbols are attached to tubes that end in two horns near the
      bottom of the woodcut.)

      Katara: Hey! It&#x27;s just like the one in the other Air Temple.
      Teo: Only an airbender can open it � so inside it&#x27;s completely untouched,
      just the way the monks left it. I&#x27;ve always wondered what it was like in
      there.
      Katara: Aang?
      Aang (lowering his head): I&#x27;m sorry, this is the last part of temple that
      the same as it was. I want it to stay that way.
      Teo: I completely understand. I just wanted you to know it was here.
      Aang: Thanks.

      (Aang turns and starts walking back down the hall the way they had come.
      Cut to a brief exterior shot of temple, followed by a shot of Sokka and
      the Mechanist walking down a dark, narrow stone staircase. They hold
      lanterns that glow light blue, but don&#x27;t put out much light.)

      Sokka: These lanterns are terrible! I can&#x27;t see.

      (He stops and opens one. Inside the jar is packed with fireflies. One
      escapes.)

      Sokka: Why would you want to use fireflies for light?
      The Mechanist: Hey! Close that up! They&#x27;ll get loose. Fireflies are a
      non-flammable light source.

      (They continue, coming to a door whose edges are blocked with some kind of
      caulk. The Mechanist feels around the caulk-like insulation, looking for
      leaks. He turns to Sokka.)

      The Mechanist: Cover your nose and hold your breath.

      (Cut to a black screen. Suddenly a panel slides open and we see Sokka and
      the Mechanist&#x27;s eyes looking into the camera.)

      Sokka: Okay, so you brought me all the way down here to see an empty room.
      The Mechanist: Wrong.

      (The panel slides again, cut back to the two on the other side of the
      door.)

      The Mechanist: It&#x27;s filled to the brim with natural gas. Came across it my
      first time here. Unfortunately, I was carrying a torch at the time. Nearly
      blew myself and the whole place even more sky high. (Screen pans up to
      show his scraggly eyebrows) Thought my eyebrows would never grow back!
      Anyway, there&#x27;s a vital problem that needs solving. From time to time we
      have gas leaks and they&#x27;re nearly impossible to find.
      Sokka (checking his part of the door for leaks): So this place is an
      explosion waiting to happen?
      The Mechanist: Yes, until I figure out how to locate something I can&#x27;t
      see, hear, smell or touch.

      (Cut to an exterior shot with gliders flying through the sky. The screen
      begins to pan down.)

      Teo (from o.c.): The wind will carry you. It supports something inside you
      � something even lighter than air, and that something takes over when you
      fly.

      (When the screen rests, Katara stands at the edge of the terrace, holding
      a glider with both hands. Teo is to her left, Aang behind her to the right
      with Momo. She leans the glider on its side.)

      Katara (looking over the side of the terrace in fear): I&#x27;ve changed my
      mind. I think I was born without that something.
      Teo (laughing): Impossible! Everybody has it.
      Aang (from o.c.): Spirit.

      (Cut to a wider shot of the three.)

      Teo: What?
      Aang: That&#x27;s the something you&#x27;re talking about.
      Teo: Yeh, I suppose it is.

      (Cut to a panning overhead shot of the terrace area. It rests on the three
      from a spot maybe a hundred feet overhead. Katara is now ready for
      takeoff, Teo ready behind her.)

      Teo: Are you ready?
      Katara: No!

      (She jumps off anyway and screams on her way down, Teo behind her. Her
      screams turn to delight, however and she gains control of the craft and
      begins to fly, Teo right with her. Cut to a shot of Katara gliding, the
      Temple in the background. Aang glides into the shot.)

      Katara: I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m flying!
      Aang: Just make sure to keep your mouth closed so you don&#x27;t swallow a bug!

      (Cut to a close up Momo flying beside her, the air in his area sparsely
      populated with bugs. He opens his mouth and eats one.)

      Katara: Teo was right about the air! All I had to do was trust it. Let it
      carry me.
      Aang: Even though Teo&#x27;s not an airbender, he really does have the spirit
      of one.

      (Cut to a long shot of Teo back on the terrace, his glider detached and
      off to the slide. Aang glides in and folds up his glider.)

      Aang: I&#x27;ve been thinking. If you wanna see what&#x27;s in that room, I&#x27;d be
      happy to open the door for you.
      Teo: Great!
      Katara (her voice echoing from o.c.): Wait! How do I land this thing? What
      if I land (swallows bug) � eh! Blech! Yech! Bug! Bug! That was a bug!

      (Cut to a quick exterior shot of the Temple, then to the Mechanist&#x27;s
      workshop. He bends over some plans on his desk while Sokka knocks over
      some junk in the background.)

      The Mechanist: I said don&#x27;t touch anything! (Sokka loses control of the
      stuff he is trying to stop from hitting the ground and the junk falls all
      over the floor.) Oh, don&#x27;t worry, that experiments old and that egg was
      just part of last week&#x27;s lunch.
      Sokka (sniffing the air): Ugh! Week old egg smell!
      The Mechanist: Quick! Find that egg!

      (Both begin crawling on their hands and knees to find the egg. Cut to
      Aang, Katara and Teo at the Temple door once again.)

      Teo: I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m finally going to see what&#x27;s inside.

      (Aang then airbends two jets of air, one from each arm, into the horns at
      the bottom of the woodcut. The air runs through the tubes and one by one
      flips the air symbols from the blue sides which had been showing, to the
      maroon sides which had been facing the interior of the temple. As each
      turns, it flips another mechanism on the outside of a door, clearly all
      three of the symbols had to trigger each of their mechanisms in order to
      unlock the Temple door. Cut back to Sokka and The Mechanist&#x27;s search for
      the egg.)

      Sokka: How could something that&#x27;s so small you can&#x27;t even see it make such
      a big stink!
      The Mechanist (getting an idea): That&#x27;s the solution to our problem!
      Sokka: Yeh!

      (The both crawl around to face each other, forgetting to stand up in their
      excitement.)

      Sokka: If we put a whole mess of rotten eggs in the cellar where the gas
      seeps up�
      The Mechanist: The gas will mix with the smell of rotten eggs�
      Sokka: Then, if there&#x27;s a leak�
      The Mechanist: You smell rotten eggs! Then you just follow your nose to
      the place where the smell is coming from�
      Sokka: And plug up the hole where the gas is escaping!
      Both: You&#x27;re a genius!

      (Suddenly a large bell starts ringing.)

      The Mechanist (getting up and running): Something&#x27;s wrong I&#x27;ve got to go.

      (Cut to a shot from inside the Air Temple sanctuary as the doors open,
      revealing Aang, Katara and Teo. They walk in and are horrified. Cut to a
      myriad of shots of the interior of the Temple sanctuary. It is filled with
      evil looking war machines and torture devices. The camera affords a zoom
      in close up shot of Aang&#x27;s face.)

      Aang: This is a nightmare.
      The Mechanist (entering behind them): You don&#x27;t understand.
      Aang (turning and pointing a finger at him in anger): You&#x27;re making
      weapons for the Fire Nation!

      (Cut to a zooming close up of the the Mechanist, Sokka behind him. Cut to
      commercial break.)

      Scene III

      (Shot opens with an overhead shot panning down. Cut to a close up of the
      Mechanist, Sokka over his shoulder behind him.)

      Sokka (angry): You make weapons for the Fire Nation!?

      (The Mechanist looks down in humiliation. Cut to Teo and Aang.)

      Teo: Explain all this! Now!
      The Mechanist: It was about a year after we moved here. Fire Nation
      soldiers found our settlement. You were too young to remember this tale.
      They were going to destroy everything, burn it to the ground. I pleaded
      with them, I begged them to spare us. They asked what I had to offer. I
      offered� my services. You must understand, I did this for you!

      (Teo turns his head and his wheelchair away. The Mechanist turns and walks
      back down the hall. Fade to the Mechanist back in his office. He is
      playing with a balloon driven by a candle in a basket below it. There are
      two eggs in the basket with happy faces on them. He lets the balloon go
      and it rises toward the ceiling. Behind him the door is heard opening. Cut
      to Aang and Teo in the doorway.)

      Aang: When are they coming?
      The Mechanist: Soon. (He looks at a clock candle which sparks once.) Very
      soon.
      Aang: You can&#x27;t give them more weapons.
      The Mechanist: If I don&#x27;t give them what they want they will destroy this
      place.

      (The balloon has floated over to them. It catches on fire at the end of
      the Mechanist&#x27;s sentence. It falls on the floor and the Mechanist moves to
      put out the flames by smothering it with a towel.)

      Teo: How can I be proud of you when your inventions are being used for
      murder?
      The Mechanist: I need some time to think. (After a pause, a little
      tinkling bell is heard.) You need to leave! Go!
      Teo: We&#x27;re not leaving!
      The Mechanist (shooing them behind some stuff): Then hide, quickly!

      (The Mechanist then pulls a lever and a wheel built into the floor begins
      to turn rapidly. A trap door in the floor next to the wheel opens and
      steam rises through the opening. A man in Fire Nation garb rises through
      the opening. He is standing on a square of wood that becomes flush with
      the rest of the floor when the elevator completes its movement.)

      Emissary: You know better than to keep me waiting. (He approaches the
      Mechanist) Give me what you owe us so I can be on my way. (The Mechanist
      looks down) Well? (Putting his face in the Mechanist&#x27;s face) Is there a
      problem?
      The Mechanist (motioning out the door): No, right this way.

      (The emissary begins to move to the door, but it is shut by a blast of air
      from Aang. He lands in front of the closed door. Cut to a frontal shot of
      Aang, obviously angered.)

      Aang: The deal&#x27;s off!
      Emissary: The Avatar!
      The Mechanist: Aang, don&#x27;t get involved!
      Emissary (pointing at the Mechanist): If I don&#x27;t get what I came for the
      Fire Nation will burn this place to rubble!
      Aang (striking the emissary with an air whip): Get out of here! You&#x27;re
      leaving empty handed!
      Emissary (pointing at Aang): Then the destruction of this temple will be
      on your head.

      (Cut to the emissary going back down the elevator. Aang closes the trap
      door with a blast of air. Cut to a long, exterior shot of the temple, then
      a panning up shot much closer in. The camera reveals the kids and Teo on
      the same causeway to the satellite building they were on earlier.)

      Sokka: This is bad! Very bad!
      Katara: Aang, what are we gonna do? How can we possibly keep them all
away?
      Aang: I&#x27;ll tell ya how. (Pointing to the sky) We have something they
      don&#x27;t. (Screens moves fast to open sky where a few gliders are moving) Air
      power! We control the sky. That&#x27; something the Fire Nation can&#x27;t do. We
      can win!
      The Mechanist (from o.c.): I want to help.
      Aang (smiling): Good, we&#x27;ll need it.

      (Cut to dusk shot of the Temple&#x27;s exterior.)

      The Mechanist (from o.c.): We finally got the war balloon working, thanks
      to Sokka.

      (Cut to view of the Mechanist&#x27;s office. It is full of people including his
      son and Katara, Sokka and Aang.)

      The Mechanist: This boy&#x27;s a genius!
      Sokka: Thank you. You&#x27;re a genius!
      The Mechanist: Thank you!

      (Cut to Aang and Katara who look at other strangely over this
      self-congratulatory exchange.)

      Sokka: See, the problem with the old war balloon was you could get it
      airborne, but once you did, it just kept going. (He demonstrates with a
      model that goes up and hits the ceiling.) You could put a hole in the top,
      but then all the hot air would escape. So the question became, how do you
      keep a lid on hot air?
      Katara (to Aang): Ugh, if only we knew.

      (Aang, Teo and Katara laugh. Cut to Sokka working with another model, but
      this balloon has a mechanism to open and close a lid on its top.)

      Sokka: A lid is actually the answer. If you control the hot air, you
      control the war balloon. (He demonstrates by pulling a string connected to
      the lid that opens and closes it.)
      Katara: Hmm. That&#x27;s actually pretty smart.
      Sokka: Okay, we&#x27;ve got four kinds of bombs. Smoke, slime, fire and�
      The Mechanist: �stink. Never underestimate the power of stink!

      (Cut to an exterior shot of the lower terrace. Many temple residents look
      out over the edge. The music has become threatening, reflecting the
      nervous anticipation on everyone&#x27;s faces.)

      Little Girl: They&#x27;re coming!
      Teo: Are we ready?
      Katara: Yes, but where&#x27;s Sokka with the war balloon?
      Aang (jumping off Appa and opening his glider as he lands): We&#x27;ll have to
      start without him.

      (Momo lands on the top of Aang&#x27;s glider. Cut to Teo smiling and putting on
      his goggles, then cut to an overhead shot of the terrace. It has now
      become a landing strip. Two rows of gliders stand ready to launch. Aang
      and Teo near there head. Teo gives a thumbs up, then Aang begins the
      launch sequence. He flies off, Teo behind and then the rest. The deck
      crews cheer as the gliders launch. Cut to a wide shot of the gliders
      taking off in formation from below. The screen pans down to the switchback
      path up to the Air Temple. It is choked with Fire Nation soldiers climbing
      up it. Up above, Aang and Teo dive, the other gliders in tow. They break
      through the cloud deck and start dropping various bombs on the surprised
      soldiers. Many fall off the path into the crevices below. Cut to a Fire
      Nation officer giving orders.)

      Officer: Take them out of the sky, now!

      (Cut to wide shot. The entire line, visible on two different switchbacks,
      of Fire Nation soldiers lowers their spears. They are bombed by gliders.
      Aang jumps off his glider onto a switchback just above the most advanced
      part of the Fire Nation infantry column. As he jumps he creates and air
      scooter. He rides along the length of the switchback, dumping huge amounts
      of snow and ice on the soldiers below. When he reaches the end of the
      switchback, he kills the air scooter and jumps back onto his glider which
      is gliding by. The avalanche he created continues to drop downward,
      engulfing row after row of soldiers. Those left begin to run back down the
      switchback path.)

      Aang: We&#x27;ve got&#x27;em on the run! We need more slime!

      (Cut to Appa floating motionless above the cloud deck. Katara hands bombs
      to gliders who pop up over Appa and then disappear back into the combat
      zone. Suddenly, several huge spikes shoot up through the clouds, narrowly
      missing Appa. The spikes are attached to chains that disappear, taught,
      into the clouds. The spikes embed themselves deep into the rock near the
      Temple. Cut to Appa flying hard to avoid the grappling hooks being thrown
      up all over the place.
      The camera follows the chain back down the sheer mountain face. As it pans
      down, the squeaky wheels of tracked vehicles can be heard. Then, Fire
      Nation tanks roar onto the screen. With two, huge spiked wheels at each
      end, these heavily armored vehicles are using the grappling hooks to allow
      them to scale the cliff face. The gliders drops bombs on them, but they
      have little effect.

      Aang flies up to the cliff face, sticks his glider staff into the naked
      rock, and pulls out one of the grappling hooks. The tank it was attached
      to begins to drop like a rock, but it fires another grappling hook
      straight up, narrowly missing Aang. It catches on the rock above, yanks
      taught, and the tank slams back into the mountain face and begins its
      climb once again.

      The tanks climb the cliff face and gain the small plateau area at the base
      of the Temple. The firebenders in the turrets begin to fire blasts of
      flame, which the gliders avoid. They drop more bombs, but they are
      ineffective against the Fire Nation armor. One firebender gets slimed
      right as Aang drops into the center of an advancing platoon of tanks. Aang
      literally blows them away (and upside down) with blasts of air, but their
      central cabins of the tanks just flip over and they begin advancing again.
      The shoot more fire blasts at Aang, who avoids them. Cut to Katara on Appa
      flying next to Teo, all surveying the battlefield.)

      Katara: Those things are unstoppable!
      Teo: I think I know how they work. I remember my Dad tinkering with the
      counterbalancing system. Something to do with water. Works great, huh?
      Katara: Water? Can you get me close to one?
      Teo: No problem!

      (Cut to Aang facing off alone against five tanks. They shoot fireball
      after fireball at him, but he bats them away. They advance on him
      steadily. Teo swoops into the picture and deposits Katara next to Aang.
      She assumes a bending stance, concentrates, and stops the forward momentum
      of one of the tanks with ice. Then, presumably bending the water within
      it, the tanks big wheels fall off. Cut back to Aang and Katara, where a
      grappling hook has grabbed Aang&#x27;s staff. Katara lifts the tank up with a
      wall of ice and it falls over, broken. They have disposed of two tanks,
      but a full dozen now bear down on them. Aang jumps in front of Katara and
      starts batting away fire blasts. The tanks close in. Aang and Katara are
      suddenly blocked by the massive bulk of Appa who lands in front of them,
      roars, and tosses aside the two point tanks. Aang and Katara jump on Appa
      and he takes off. They survey the battlefield and it is clear that the
      situation is not good. Broken down tanks dot the battlefield, but most are
      still advancing, now closely supported by infantry formations. Cut back to
      the landing field terrace where Katara, Teo and Aang are in hasty council,
      with Momo in the foreground.)

      Teo: We&#x27;re out of bombs!
      Katara: Come on, Sokka, where&#x27;s that war balloon?

      (As Katara speaks, the war balloon rises behind her in the background. The
      balloon is red and decked out with a Fire Nation symbol. It&#x27;s removable
      top and tail fin give it a vaguely blimp like shape. The Mechanist and
      Sokka ride in the basket below the balloon. The basket also contains the
      coal burning plant that provides the heat for the balloon&#x27;s air. Attached
      to the basket are four huge sacks of material used for ballast. The
      balloon moves out over the battlefield as the enemy armor advances below.
      Cut to a shot of Sokka and the Mechanist in the basket.)

      Sokka: Hey, why aren&#x27;t they shooting at us?
      The Mechanist (cut to a view of the Fire Nation symbol): The insignia!
      They think we&#x27;re on their side!
      Sokka (cutting a rope with his knife): Then I guess they won&#x27;t see this
      coming.
      The Mechanist: Bomb away!

      (Cut to a long shot of the balloon and the enemy troops and tanks
      underneath. One of the ballast sacks drops and blows in a huge explosion
      of slime on the ground. Sokka drops the other three bombs. The slime
      washes most of the infantry away, but the tanks continue. They reach the
      next cliff to scale and begin to use their grappling hooks.)

      Sokka: Oh no! That was the last one!
      The Mechanist: Wait a second, (he sniffs the air) you smell that?
      Sokka: Rotten eggs!

      (Cut to an overhead shot of the balloon. They are passing over a
crevasse.)

      Sokka: There! That&#x27;s where the gas is escaping!

      (Cut to a shot from below the balloon looking up at Sokka&#x27;s face. He gets
      an idea. Cut to a shot of the tanks scaling the cliff, Air Temple
      residents working furiously up top to dislodge the grappling hooks. Cut
      back to Sokka who begins to ready the balloon&#x27;s coal-burning plant to be
      thrown overboard.)

      The Mechanist: What are you doing!? That&#x27;s our fuel source!
      Sokka: It&#x27;s the only bomb we&#x27;ve got!

      (The throw the coal furnace over board into the crevasse. It hits the
      sides on its way down. Cut to a few shots of the advancing Fire Nation
      soldiers and tanks as well as a few shots of the nerve-wracked defenders.
      Then shift to a long shot of the Temple, which is suddenly buffeted by a
      series of enormous, fiery explosions at its base. The coal furnace has
      ignited the escaping natural gas. The Temple is covered in smoke. When it
      clears, the grappling hook chains dangle in the breeze with nothing
      attached to them. In the distance, the remaining Fire Nation troops are
      running back down the mountain. In the foreground, Aang and company watch
      the enemy leave.)

      Aang: Look! They&#x27;re retreating!
      All: Yeh!!!

      (Suddenly the war balloon enters the frame on a clear downward
trajectory.)

      Sokka: We&#x27;re going down!
      Katara: No! Sokka! Hold on!

      (Aang springs into action, unfolding his glider and taking off in one
      smooth action. Cut to the descending balloon. It&#x27;s hot air is cooling
      rapidly. Sokka swings his boomerang around attached to a rope.)

      Sokka: Get ready!

      (As Aang flies by, Sokka throws the boomerang. It catches on Aang&#x27;s foot,
      pulling Sokka and the Mechanist clear of the falling balloon. Aang flies
      them back up, while the balloon continues to fall. Fade back a long shot
      of the main terrace of the Air Temple, the cut to a close shot of Aang and
      his friends. Behind Aang is a circular stone bench on which Katara and
      some of the black and white hermit crabs sit.)

      Aang: You know what? I&#x27;m really glad you guys all live here now. It&#x27;s like
      the hermit crab (he picks one up from the stone bench.), maybe you weren&#x27;t
      born here, but you found this empty shell and made it your home. And now
      you protect each other.
      Teo: That means a lot coming from you.
      Sokka: Aang, you were right about air power. (Pointing to the sky) As long
      as we&#x27;ve got the skies we&#x27;ll have the Fire Nation on the run!

      (Cut to a wide, long shot of the terrace as gliders fly by. The crowd
      cheers Sokka. Then cut to a wide shot of Aang and his friends as the
      camera pans right. The shot stops on the Mechanist who turns towards the
      camera and looks down, troubled by something. Fade to a shot of snow
      covered trees as the camera pans down. When the pan stops, a group of Fire
      Nation soldiers stand around the fallen war balloon. The are heating the
      air in the balloon, causing it to refill. Cut to a frontal shot of a Fire
      Nation commander flanked on each side by a guard.)

      Commander: This defeat is the gateway to many victories.

      (He smiles, then cut to the resurgent Fire Nation symbol on the side of
      the balloon as it finishes refilling. Fade to white.)

第十七回
北气和寺

各位看官
若你们下次看到会说话的怪鸟时
最好离近点看仔细了
它很可能不是一只大鹦鹉哟
没准是个飞人呢
这些飞天行者是某个秘密组织的成员
他们嘲笑重力
以及那些凭借重力依附于土地的生灵
御气师的故事好听吧？
听起来好玄啊
故事里讲的都是真的吗？
你看，我不一直都在嘲笑重力吗？哈哈
重力...
（估计他不知重力是啥）
捧个钱场吧
抱歉啊，囊中羞涩
真是小气鬼
你的故事讲得真棒啊
讲得好你倒是给点钱啊
看人家小蝙蝠，可比你慷慨多了
（模模是狐猴啦，乱讲）
还能听到御气师的故事，对我来说意义非凡
您的曾祖父肯定在几百年前见过他们吧
孩子，你在胡诌什么呢？
我的曾爷爷上个礼拜才见到这些飞天行者的
看哪，我们快到北气和寺了
在这里曾经举办过飞天牛球锦标赛呢
你觉得我们会找到其他御气师吗？
你是想让我顺着你的话说呢，还是讲真话？
你是说我是个骗子喽？
我是说你是个乐观主义者，
不过本质上和骗子没啥两样
伙计们，快看哪！
嘿，真得有御气师啊
不，他们不是
怎么会不是呢？
你看那些人不是都在飞吗？
那顶多也只能叫滑翔，不能算飞
从运动的形式就能看出来，他们并不是御气师
他们飞得就像没有灵魂一样
安昂，那我就搞不懂了，你看那个男孩多有精神啊
在装上什么东西之前，咱们还是赶快着陆吧
加油啊，陶！
让那个光头小孩瞧瞧你的厉害
幸会啊，你飞得真的很棒
那当然
除了花样滑行我还有更厉害的呢
哇哦，我可做不了这个动作
不过，我这招也很厉害
你觉得怎么样？
还不错
嘿，你是个货真价实的御气师啊
你想必就是降世神通吧
真难以置信啊
我...我...我听过的故事哩
多谢夸奖
哇哦，你得滑翔椅棒透了
这不算什么，我老爸还有很多很棒的发明呢
没错，我老爸就是这里的幕后缔造者
所有东西都是由热空气提供能源的
在外面滑翔的升力也是有热空气流提供的
由专门的泵向外输送
这个地方真难以置信
嗯，这儿很棒，是吧？
我不是那个意思
只是觉得难以置信而已
安昂以前曾经来过这里
我想他只是有点惊讶，对他来说会感觉有点...
...物事人非
肯定比原来好多了
这里应该陈列着我族人的历史才对
肯定寺中还有一些地方会保持原样的
太好了，终于看到一处地方还能保持它原来的模样
小心啊！
怎么这么不小心呢
你家大人每教过你应该远离建筑工地吗，多危险啊
我们正在为浴房拓展空间呢
你知道你在干什么吗？
居然敢在这么神圣的地方大兴土木
居然为了就为了个破澡堂子
得建个澡房，不然大家都会臭臭的
这个地方已经被你们弄得臭烘烘了
这是一座神圣的寺院
不能任由你在这里胡闹
我来过这里，这儿曾经住过许多僧侣，
我知道这儿曾经是什么模样
见过这儿的和尚？
怎么可能，你才只有岁
老爸，
他是降世神通
他百年前曾经来过这里
你知道自己在干什么吗？
谁允许你们搬到这儿来住的
嗯，请听我解释，
这也是很久以前的事了，不过不到一百年
由于一场可怕的洪水，我和乡亲们都成了难民
当时,我的独子, 陶,伤的很重, 他的母亲也在那场洪水中死去了
我们需要另辟一处,重新开始生活
很巧,我们路过此处
真是难以置信啊
这里到处都是飞人的壁画
但是我们找遍了这里, 却没有看到一个人影
但是我们找遍了这里, 却没有看到一个人影
我们又发现了这个扇形的玩意, 结构十分精巧
你是指我们的滑翼?
没错, 这种飞行器又小又轻
深深的启发了我
为了我的儿子, 我应该在空中
开始我们的新生活
从此我们每个人都可以平等的生活了
话说回来
我们只是在这里原有的基础上进行改进的工作
说实话, 大自然不是也在做着同样的事情吗
但是自然知道什么时候该适可而止
也许你说的对
看来, 今天的改进工作要告一段落了
看看都几点了~
是时候该给滑轮组系统上润滑油了, 天黑了可就干不了了
等等, 看那个东西就能知道时间了
那上面的刻痕看起来都一样啊
蜡烛会给我们报时的
看好了
原来你在蜡烛里加了闪光粉
四个火花出现, 说明现在已经下午四点了
我们也可以这么叫&quot;四个烛时&quot;
(整点在英语里为O&#x27;clock, 老头则戏称他定的时间为O&#x27;candle)
喜欢吧, 等会儿给你看看&quot;防切手的磨刀器&quot;
只要拔下来就能用了,方便吧~
跟我来
嘿, 安昂, 想给你看点东西
我就是没办法适应
什么都变得不一样了
虽然我不太明白
也许寺庙变得不一样了
但现在住在这里的生物应该还没有搬走吧
你说得没错
他们就像寺庙血统的继承者一样
其实, 寺中可能有一个地方完全没有变过
嘿, 这里跟南气和寺的一模一样啊
只有御气师才能打开它...
所以里面的东西应该没人动过
肯定和僧侣们离开时的一样
我一直好奇想知道里面究竟是什么样子
安昂
我很抱歉
这是这寺庙中仅存的净土了
就让它保持原来的风貌吧
我知道了
我只是想告诉你还有这么一个地方
谢谢你
这灯笼也太烂了
我都看不清楚
为什么偏偏用萤火虫取光
嘿,快把它盖上
他们会跑光的
为的是避免使用明火
捂住你的鼻子，屏息呼吸
好的
你把我一路带到这儿就为了看个空屋子？
答错
这里并不是空的，充满了天然气
记得我第一次偶然发现这里的时候，
真倒霉，当时我是拿着火把照亮的
差点把我崩飞了，这个地方也险些完蛋
你看看，从那时起我的眉毛就再也没长回来
这个天然气的问题生死攸关，亟待解决啊
一直以来天然气都在泄漏，
可是就是不知道漏点在哪儿？
那这个地方岂不像个定时炸弹？
那可不，最好有个方便看得见听得着的方法
来定位漏点就好了
别担心，风会托住你的
好像体内有种东西支撑着你...它比空气更轻
只要将自己托付于它，你就可以自由飞翔
我还是不飞了
我想我骨子没有你所说的那个东西
不可能
没个人都有的
灵魂
什么？
这就是你们在讨论的东西
对，这就我想说的
你准备好了吗
没有
真不敢相信我居然在飞
记得飞行时不要张嘴，否则可能会吞进小虫子哦
陶的那套空气理论很有道理
你只要相信它就可以，它自然会承载着你飞翔
虽然陶并不是个御气师，
但他却拥有御气师的精神和灵魂
我考虑过了
既然你那么想进那个房间看看
我很乐意打开门让你去看看
太棒了
等等
我该怎么着陆啊？
我要是撞....
死虫子，死虫子
我居然吞了个虫子
我都说过不要乱碰东西的嘛
哦，便担心，这些仪器都已经很旧了
那个鸡蛋不过是我上星期的午餐
呃~放了一个礼拜，都臭了
快，把那个蛋找出来
太激动了，终于可以进去看看了
这东西这么小，怎么闻起来这么臭啊
我想到解决天然气问题的方法了
对...如果我们把一堆臭鸡蛋
放到天然气涌出的那个地窖里
那么天然气就会与臭鸡蛋的气味混合在一起
那么，只要一有泄漏
就能闻见一股臭鸡蛋的味道
查出臭味的来源，也就能查出漏点所在了
到时候只要堵住漏点就可以了
你真是个天才
出事了，我得过去看看
简直就是场噩梦
你不了解
你竟然在为烈火国铸造武器
你为烈火国铸造武器？！
快解释清楚
现在就说
那还要从搬到这儿的第二年说起
烈火国的士兵发现了我们的落脚点
当时你还太小，所以可能没有什么印象
他们见东西就毁，想把这里夷为平地
我恳求他们放我们一马
他们说可以，但是有个前提
不得已，我只能为他们服务
你要知道，我这么做都是为了你啊
他们什么时候会来？
快来了
可能会很快
不能把这些武器交给他们
如果不交给他们的话，他们就会毁了这里
我原来还为你的发明感到骄傲呢，
这些发明竟然被用作杀人武器
我需要时间来想想办法
你们赶快离开，快走
我们不会走的
那就快点躲起来
你知道拖延交货是什么后果吧
把欠我们的赶紧给我拿出来
有问题吗？
没有，请这边走
交易取消了
是降世神通
安昂，别卷进来
如果我得不到我想要的东西，我就会把这里夷为平地
给我滚出去
这回你得空手而归了
竟然敬酒不吃吃罚酒
糟了，真是太糟了
安昂，我们该怎么办？
我们怎么能抵挡住这么多人
山人自由妙计
我们可有秘密武器哟
那就是空气的力量
我们有制空权
火宗的人可不会飞
这场仗我们赢定了
我也想帮忙
太好了
少了你的帮助怎么能行呢
多亏了索卡，我们使作战气球运转了起来
这小孩真是个天才
多谢夸奖
你更是个天才
（这俩人互相捧上臭脚了）
多谢夸奖
老式的作战气球有个问题，就是不能空降；
一旦下降了，就会一直降下去
如果在上面做个洞的话，热空气又会跑出去
所以问题就来了，我们该怎样维持住热空气呢？
我们这方面可是一窍不通啊
没错，只要在热气球上方加个盖子就成了
只要能控制好热空气，
那控制好作战气球也就不成问题了
嗯，还真是个好主意呢
好的，我们现在一共有四中炸弹可用
烟雾弹、粘液弹、烈焰弹，还有...
臭气弹
可不要小瞧臭味的威力啊
他们来了
准备好了吗？
好了，但是索卡的作战气球在哪里？
先别管他，咱们先开始吧
把他们给我打下来
马上
把他们打跑了
我需要更多的粘液弹
（怎么？粘液弹是用阿柏的鼻涕做的？）
这些东西还真难缠
我想我知道他们是怎样运作的
我记得老爹修过这种东西的平衡系统
好像是通过水工作的
很精巧不是吗
你是说水？
你能让我靠近其中一台吗？
没问题
炸弹用光了
快点，索卡
作战气球在哪？
嘿，他们怎么不攻击我们
气球上有火宗的徽章
他们以为我们是同伙的
那我就不客气了
炸弹来喽
不好，这是最后一个了
等等
你闻到了吗？
臭鸡蛋味
那，天然气是从那儿露出来的
你要干嘛？那可是咱们的燃料源啊
这是咱们仅剩的炸弹了
看
他们撤退了
我们正在往下跌
不要啊
索卡，坚持住
准备好
你们知道吗...
我真高兴你们大家能够住在这里
就像这寄居蟹一样
也许你们并不是出生在这里
但是你们找到了这里，并把这里当成了自己的家
你们互相扶持，互相保护
从你们那里我学会了很多
安昂，你之前说得对
只要我们能够掌握住制空权，火宗的人就不足所惧了
塞翁失马，焉知非福啊~

水善国
土强国
火烈国
气和国
很久以前，这四大国和谐共处
然而，烈火国发起的战争结束了和平
只有同时掌握四种元素的降世神通才能结束战争
然而在大家最需要他的时候，他却消失了
年后，我和哥哥发现了转世的降世神通，
他是个御气师，名叫“安昂”
尽管他的御气术着实厉害
在拯救苍生之前，他要学的还有很多
但是我坚信
安昂 能拯救这个世界
