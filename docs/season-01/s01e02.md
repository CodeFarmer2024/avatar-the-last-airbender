      Act I

      (The episode opens with a repeat shot of the flare set off by Aang in the
      prior episode falling from the sky. It is nearly sunset. The screen pans
      down to reveal a shot from behind Gran Gran and some other villagers. They
      look down the ice road out of their village to see Aang and Katara in the
      distance walking toward them. As they approach, the children run forward
      to greet them.)

      Children: Yay! Aang&#x27;s back!

      (The children gather around Aang as Sokka comes forward angrily.)

      Sokka (pointing at Aang): I knew it! You signaled the Fire Navy with that
      flare! You&#x27;re leading them straight to us, aren&#x27;t you?
      Katara: Aang didn&#x27;t do anything. It was an accident.
      Aang: Yeh, we were on the ship and there was this booby trap and well�.
      (putting his hand to his head as if trying to puzzle out the thought) �we
      �boobied� right into it.
      Gran Gran (shaking her head): Katara, you shouldn&#x27;t have gone on that
      ship. Now we could all be in danger!
      Aang: Don&#x27;t blame Katara! I brought her there. (Looking downcast) It&#x27;s my
      fault.
      Sokka: Aha! The traitor confesses! Warriors, away from the enemy! (The
      children walk away from Aang and towards Sokka and Gran Gran.) The
      foreigner is banned from our village!
      Katara (angrily): Sokka, you&#x27;re making a mistake.
      Sokka: No! I&#x27;m keeping my promise to Dad. I&#x27;m protecting you from threats
      like him!
      Katara (motioning to Aang): Aang is not our enemy! Don&#x27;t you see? Aang&#x27;s
      brought us something we haven&#x27;t had in a long time. Fun.
      Sokka: Fun? We can&#x27;t fight firebenders with fun!
      Aang (smiling earnestly): You should try it sometime.
      Sokka: Get out of our village. Now!
      Katara: Grandmother, please, don&#x27;t let Sokka do this.
      Gran Gran: Katara, you knew going on that ship was forbidden. Sokka is
      right. I think it best if the airbender leaves.
      Katara: Then I&#x27;m banished too!

      (She turns, taking Aang by the shoulder, and begins to walk off.)

      Katara: C&#x27;mon, Aang, let&#x27;s go!

      (Cut to a wide, profile shot of the scene. Appa is on the left, ready for
      flight, Sokka and the villagers on the right. In between are Katara and
      Aang walking to Appa, the sun starting to set behind them.)

      Sokka (pointing at Katara): Where do you think you&#x27;re going?
      Katara: To find a waterbender! Aang is taking me to the North Pole!
      Aang (momentarily confused, then brightening): I am? Great!
      Sokka: Katara! (She stops) Would you really choose him over your tribe?
      Your own family?

      (She pauses, doubt and indecision on her face. Aang comes up next to her.)

      Aang: Katara, I don&#x27;t want to come between you and your family.

      (He walks forward and o.c. towards Appa.)

      Katara: So, you&#x27;re leaving the South Pole? This is goodbye?
      Aang: Thanks for penguin sledding with me.
      Katara: Where will you go?
      Aang (putting a hand on Appa): Guess I&#x27;ll go back home and look for the
      airbenders. (Thinking) Wow, I haven&#x27;t cleaned my room in a hundred years.
      Not looking forward to that.

      (He airbends himself onto Appa&#x27;s head where he takes the reigns. He turns
      to address the village.)

      Aang: It was nice meeting everyone.
      Sokka: Let&#x27;s see your bison fly now, air boy.
      Aang: Come on, Appa, you can do it! Yip! Yip!

      (Appa rumbles and gets onto his feet.)

      Sokka: Yeh, I thought so.

      (Just then a little girl with pig tails rushes forward with a cry to stand
      by Katara.)

      Little Girl (her eyes shining with tears): Aang! Don&#x27;t go! We&#x27;ll miss you!
      Aang (sadly): I&#x27;ll miss you too.

      (He turns to look at Katara, then cut to a close of Katara, her braids
      blowing in the breeze. Cut back to Aang who turns away, shaking the reigns
      once more.)

      Aang: Come on, boy.

      (Appa begins to walk off in the background, Katara and the little girl,
      backs to the camera, in the foreground. The little girls runs off crying
      back to the village while Gran Gran comes up behind Katara.)

      Gran Gran: Katara, you&#x27;ll feel better after you �
      Katara (cutting her off angrily): You happy now? There goes my one chance
      of becoming a waterbender!

      (She too stalks off angrily, leaving Gran Gran alone.

      Cut to a shot of Sokka directing the little boys through the village gate.
      Martial music plays in the background.)

      Sokka: All right! Ready our defenses! The Fire Nation could be on our
      shores any moment now!

      (A little boy stops, raising his head and dancing about suggestively.)

      Little Boy: But, I gotta �
      Sokka (cutting him off forcefully and pointing to the fortifications): And
      no potty breaks!

      (Fade to a shot of the frozen wasteland outside the village. The camera
      pans right to reveal Appa and Aang resting in the curves of some ice
      formations. The formation has two doughnut shaped holes. Appa lies on his
      back in the lower one, Aang in the smaller higher one. Appa rumbles.)

      Aang: Yeh, I liked her too.

      (Aang looks out to see and gets up with a start. Cut to his p.o.v. which
      shows a Fire Navy ship steaming toward the village. The camera zooms
      backward to show the back of Aang&#x27;s head. He looks over from the ship to
      where the village lies over the horizon.)

      Aang: The village! (He slides down off his perch) Appa, wait here!

      (Appa rumbles in reply and shifts his position slightly. Cut to Sokka
      putting on his war garb. Fingerless gloves, arm wraps, boots and face
      paint are all applied silently.

      Cut to a quick exterior shot of Zuko&#x27;s ship steaming ahead, then cut again
      to a parallel shot of Zuko being helped into his armor by some attendants.
      He girds himself with a breastplate, shoulder guard and helmet.

      The scene shifts to Sokka leaving his tent with his weapons, then cut to a
      silent overhead pan shot of the village. Alone, Sokka stands atop the ice
      wall of the village, scanning the mist for any sign of the enemy.
      Suddenly, a deep rumbling noise is heard and the ground begins to shake.
      Parts of the wall on which Sokka stands begins to crumble. The villagers
      look around in alarm. Cut back to Sokka where the guard tower in the
      background collapses in a heap of snow and ice.)

      Sokka (disappointed at the tower&#x27;s collapse): Oh man!

      (Pandemonium breaks out in the village as people being to run every which
      way. Katara is in their midst, but stops, seeing something in the mist.
      Cut to a shot from Katara&#x27;s p.o.v. Still atop the wall, Sokka looks small.
      Suddenly a massive shadow emerges from the mist, dwarfing Sokka. It is the
      bow of Prince Zuko&#x27;s ship.

      Cut to a zoom in close up of Sokka.)

      Sokka: Ohhh, man!

      (The shot shifts to a profile view of the village and the encroaching
      ship. Prince Zuko&#x27;s vessel has cut through the ice all the way to the city
      wall itself. As the ships continue to ice break towards the wall, Katara
      puts Gran Gran into one of the tents in the rear and then gets a little
      child out of harm&#x27;s way as the ice floor of the village begins to crack
      all over the place under the stress.

      As she puts the child in a tent, she turns to look back to Sokka. Cut to a
      wide overhead shot of the ship reaching the wall, Sokka poised both
      tragically and comically to the ships hull with his weapon.)

      Katara: Sokka, get out of the way!

      (As the ship reaches the wall, it collapses into a heap of ice and snow
      which tumbles back into the village, carrying Sokka with it. Cut to a wide
      shot of the ship which has come to a halt. Steam wafts up from where the
      bow has split the ice. The villagers, Katara in front, have emerged from
      their shelters and stare in trepidation and amazement at the ship. Katara
      draws a deep breath in anticipation. Cut to Sokka looking up at the ship,
      who also draws breath.

      Cut to a wide shot from behind Sokka that pans up. With a noise of metal
      on metal the bowsprit of the ship opens and folds out and down onto the
      village&#x27;s floor. The bowsprit has become a huge gangplank, similar to the
      Roman corvus, for disembarking Fire Nation troops. Sokka&#x27;s falls backwards
      to avoid being crushed by the bowsprit.

      As the steam clears from the top of the bowsprit, Zuko and a host of Fire
      Nation soldiers are revealed. A quick cut to Sokka and the villagers is
      replaced by one of Zuko walking down the gangplank stairs followed by
      guards.

      Cut back to Sokka, who gets up and charges Zuko with an adolescent war
      cry. As he runs up the steps to the Prince, Zuko casually and expertly
      kicks his weapon out of his hand and then kicks him in the face, sending
      him sprawling on the ice to the planks right. His head gets stuck in the
      snow and he struggles comically to free himself. The villagers draw back
      in fright and the ease with which their only warrior has been dispatched
      by the invaders. Cut to an overhead shot of the villagers and Fire Nation
      soldiers who have now reached them. Zuko walks forward to address the
      village. He looks over the crowd, then walks over to Katara and Gran
Gran.)

      Zuko: Where are you hiding him?

      (He looks around the crowd as there is no immediate response. He grabs
      Gran Gran and shows her to the villagers.)

      Zuko: He&#x27;d be about this age? Master of all elements?

      (Again no one responds. After a brief pause, he throws Gran Gran roughly
      back to Katara. With a cry of frustration he launches a gout of flame over
      the villager&#x27;s heads. The cower in fear.)

      Zuko: I know you&#x27;re hiding him!

      (Behind Zuko, Sokka gets up, his face paint largely gone. He retrieves his
      weapon and charges Zuko with another cry. Cut to Sokka&#x27;s p.o.v., where
      Zuko turns to him in annoyance. He dodges Sokka&#x27;s charges and flips him
      over his head. Zuko fires a blast of flame at Sokka, but Sokka rolls out
      of the way, throwing his boomerang at Zuko as he does. Caught by surprise,
      Zuko barely avoids the boomerang. He turns to look back in anger at Sokka
      over the near miss. Cut back to Sokka, the villagers behind him. A little
      boy in the crowd throws him a spear.)

      Little Boy: Show no fear!

      (Sokka catches the spear and charges Zuko, who, as Sokka reaches him,
      breaks off pieces of the spear shaft with his wrist guards. After the head
      of the spear has been shorn off, Zuko grabs the spear, boinks Sokka on the
      forehead with it several times, then breaks it in half and drops the
      pieces on the ground. Sokka, after getting bonked on the head, has also
      sunk to the ground, rubbing his head. A �down the tubes� sound effect
      plays for a comic effect. Cut to a shot from Sokka&#x27;s p.o.v., with Zuko
      standing sternly over him. In the sky in the background the boomerang
      reappears. It slams Zuko in the back of the head, knocking his helmet off
      kilter. Furious, Zuko begins to spit fire out of his hands as he hovers
      menacingly over Sokka.

      Cut to Aang skyrocketing towards the village on a penguin, staff in hand.
      He flies right under Zuko, sweeping his legs out from under him. Zuko
      lands butt up. The helmet lands on his behind in a most suggestive manner.
      The children cheer as Aang reaches the villagers. As he and the penguin
      bank, they dump a lot of snow on the cheering kids. They stop cheering for
      a moment, but then take up the cheer again anyway. The penguin slides to a
      halt and it pushes Aang off. The penguin gets up, looks at Aang, and then
      turns and waddles away.)

      Aang: Hey Katara. Hey Sokka.
      Sokka (dryly): Hi�Aang. Thanks for comin&#x27;.

      (Aang looks over at the Firebenders. Cut to Zuko getting to his feet and
      assuming a firebending stance, then cut to an overhead shot of Aang at the
      ready with his staff, surrounded by Zuko and his men. They begin to close
      in, but Aang blows the men on either side of him backwards with blasts of
      air. He blasts Zuko as well, but he holds his ground, shielding his face
      from the wind.)

      Aang: Looking for me?
      Zuko (incredulous): You&#x27;re the airbender? You&#x27;re the Avatar?
      Katara: Aang?
      Sokka: No way.

      (Cut to an overhead shot showing Zuko and Aang maneuvering for position
      against each other in the middle of a village that has become an arena.)

      Zuko: I&#x27;ve spent years preparing for this encounter. Training. Meditating.
      You&#x27;re just a child!
      Aang: Well, you&#x27;re just a teenager.

      (Zuko fires blast after blast. Aang cries out. He is hard pressed, fear
      showing on his face. Aang dissipates each blast as it strikes by twirling
      his staff in front of him like a helicopter blade. The dissipation doesn&#x27;t
      block the fire from reaching the villagers, though, and they cry out. Aang
      looks behind to them and realizes he can&#x27;t protect them all.)

      Aang: If I go with you, will you promise to leave everyone alone?

      (Cut to wide shot of Zuko still in a firebending stance. After a brief
      pauses he straightens up and nods stiffly. Cut back to Aang, a soldier&#x27;s
      hands entering the frame to take his staff and lead him to the ship. Cut
      to a shot of the villagers where Katara rushes forward.)

      Katara: No, Aang! Don&#x27;t do this!
      Aang: Don&#x27;t worry, Katara, it&#x27;ll be okay. (They push him forward roughly)
      Take care of Appa for me until I get back.
      Zuko: Head a course to the Fire Nation. I&#x27;m going home.

      (They board the ship and the bowsprit rises back up. Aang looks back
      hopefully at his new friend as the ship closes. Katara&#x27;s eyes water as the
      prison closes around Aang. His smile drops as he sees her pain. The shadow
      of the closing bowsprit closes over him, then cut to commercial break and
      the bowsprit snaps into place.)

      Act II

      (The shows returns with an overhead shot of the village. It is morning.
      The jagged path through the ice that Zuko&#x27;s ship opened is plainly visible
      as is the shattered village wall. Life goes on, however, the fire at the
      center of the village smokes and villager are visible about their work.
      Several shots flip by of villagers tending the fire, digging out the
      watchtower and re-raising tents. They look sad. Cut to a long shot of
      Katara at the water&#x27;s edge looking out at the sun rising over the sea,
      then cut to a frontal view of her. Sokka walks by in the background
      carrying some things.)

      Katara: We have to go after that ship, Sokka. Aang saved our tribe; now we
      have to save him.
      Sokka: Katara, I�
      Katara: Why can&#x27;t you realize that he&#x27;s on our side? If we don&#x27;t help him,
      no one will. I know you don&#x27;t like Aang, but we owe him and I�
      Sokka: Katara! Are you gonna talk all day or are you comin&#x27; with me?

      (Sokka motions to his left and the screen expands to show a canoe ready to
      go.)

      Katara (with a happy gasp): Sokka!

      (She gives him a bear hug.)

      Sokka: Get in. We&#x27;re going to save your boyfriend.
      Katara: He&#x27;s not my�
      Sokka: Whatever.
      Gran Gran (entering the shot from behind them): What do you two think
      you&#x27;re doing?

      (They turn and try to look innocent. Cut to Gran Gran, who looks
      momentarily severe, but then smiles and offers them a blue bundle.)

      Gran Gran: You&#x27;ll need these. You have a long journey ahead of you. It&#x27;s
      been so long since I&#x27;ve had hope. But you brought it back to life, my
      little waterbender. (She hugs Katara) And you, my brave warrior, be nice
      to your sister.

      (She hugs Sokka.)

      Sokka: Yeah... okay, Gran.
      Gran Gran: Aang is the Avatar. He&#x27;s the world&#x27;s only chance. You both
      found him for a reason. Now your destinies are intertwined with his.
      Katara (turning to the canoe): There&#x27;s no way we&#x27;re gonna catch a war ship
      with a canoe.

      (The shot expands to show Appa mounting the crest of hill in the
      background. He emits a low rumble as he approaches.)

      Katara: Appa!

      (She runs o.c. towards Appa.)

      Sokka: You just love taking me out of my comfort zone, don&#x27;t ya?

      (Fade to a shot of Zuko&#x27;s ship&#x27;s prow cutting through the ice packed
      water. Cut to the foredeck. Aang, hands bound behind him, faces Zuko, Iroh
      and a bunch of guards.)

      Zuko: This staff will make an excellent gift for my father. I suppose you
      wouldn&#x27;t know of fathers, being raised by monks. Take the Avatar to the
      prison hold. And (shoving the staff in Iroh&#x27;s direction) take this to my
      quarters.

      (Iroh takes the staff as Zuko walks away. Iroh immediately turns to the
      guard on his left.)

      Iroh: Hey, you mind taking this to his quarters for me?

      (The guard takes the staff as Aang is escorted down some stairs into the
      ship. A quick shot of the ship steaming through a narrow strip of water
      between walls of ice is replaced by another of Aang being escorted along
      one of the ship&#x27;s hallways.)

      Aang: So... I guess you never fought an airbender before. I bet I can take
      you both with my hands tied behind my back.
      Guard 1: Silence!

      (They stop in front of a door. As one of the guards moves to open the door
      with a key, Aang draws a great breath and blows the guard with the key
      into the door, knocking him out. The breath also propels him backwards and
      into the guard behind him. They are blown all the way back down the
      hallway. They crash into the stairs they came down on. The guard is
      knocked out since Aang used him to cushion his own impact. Aang then
      airbends himself back up onto the deck and airbends the door at the end of
      the deck open. He enters the ship and runs down the hall. Cut to an
      overhead shot from the bridge looking down onto the foredeck. One of the
      guards Aang just escaped from emerges and shouts up to a guard on the
      bridge deck in the foreground. The bridge guards turns and runs o.c.)

      Guard 2: The Avatar has escaped!

      (Cut to an overhead shot of Appa swimming through the water, with Katara
      at the reigns and Sokka on his back in the saddle.)

      Sokka (drearily): Go. Fly. Soar.
      Katara: Please, Appa, we need your help. Aang needs your help.
      Sokka: Up. Ascend. Elevate.
      Katara: Sokka doesn&#x27;t believe you can fly, but I do, Appa. (Coaxingly)
      Come on. Don&#x27;t you wanna save Aang?

      (Appa rumbles in response, but doesn&#x27;t speed up or fly.)

      Sokka: What was it that kid said? Yee-ha? Hup hup? Wahoo? Uh... yip yip?

      (This last gets a response. Appa rumbles again and begins to flop his
      massive beaver tail. He begins to hop along the surface of the water as he
      picks up speed. Finally, with a mighty heave, he takes off into the sky.)

      Katara (ecstatic): You did it, Sokka!
      Sokka: He&#x27;s flying! He&#x27;s flying! Katara, he&#x27;s�! (Katara gives him a smug
      look. Then, nonchalantly) I mean, big deal, he&#x27;s flying.

      (Cut to a stationary shot as Appa flies by at high and into the horizon,
      then cut to Aang running down one of the ship&#x27;s hallway, looking behind
      him for pursuers. His hands are still bound behind him. He turns and
      starts to run forward � right into three Fire Nation soldiers blocking his
      way, weapons drawn.)

      Aang (panting): You haven&#x27;t seen my staff around, have you?

      (Aang runs forward and up and around the guards by running along the walls
      and ceiling in corkscrew circles. He gets by them with ease and look at
      his retreating form with surprise.)

      Aang: Thanks anyway!

      (He runs into another hallway, this time blocked by a single guard. He
      blasts a fireball at him, but he avoids it by launching himself over the
      guards head. The frame rate slows as Aang passes, showing how Aang is able
      to cut his wrist bonds by catching them on the horn of the guard&#x27;s helmet.
      The bonds break and the guard is thrown off balance and onto the ground.
      Aang, his hands now free, runs o.c. Several shots of Aang opening random
      doors goes by. The last door he opens reveals a snoring Iroh.)

      Aang (whispering): Sorry...

      (Sight gag: His lips linger behind the rest of his head to say it while he
      closes the door. He then runs by another open door, stops and turns back
      to it.)

      Aang: My staff!

      (He enters and the door shuts behind him. Cut to an interior shot of the
      room where it is clear that Zuko was hiding in wait for the Avatar.)

      Zuko: Looks like I underestimated you.

      (After a brief pause, Zuko begins blasting fire at Aang, who barely
      dodges. He is terrified and he gasps and pants to catch his breath. After
      dodging a few more shots, Aang rolls underneath Zuko to get behind him. By
      staying behind him, Zuko is unable to blast him with fire. Cut to an
      exterior shot of the upper decks of the ship. The long window of the room
      where Aang and Zuko are fighting lights up every other second each time
      Zuko releases a blast. Cut back to the fight, where Aang now faces Zuko.
      He dissipates each fireball with a small air ball he forms with his hands.
      Aang creates an air scooter and rides around the walls and ceiling of the
      room, all the time getting licked by the gouts of flame Zuko unleashes at
      him. Aang terminates the airball and grabs a tapestry off the wall. He
      wraps Zuko up in it as he passes. While Zuko struggles against the
      tapestry, Aang is able to grab his staff. Zuko breaks his bonds and they
      once again square off against each other. After a few seconds of
      maneuvering, Aang airbends a mattress up off the floor and slams it into
      Zuko. The mattress propels Zuko into the opposite wall. He is smashed into
      it and he falls to the ground, onto the mattress. Aang then airbends the
      mattress up to the Zuko, smashing Zuko into that. Both fall back down to
      the ground. Zuko looks up in anger to find Aang gone.

      Cut to the bridge, where a the wheel mechanism that opens a deck hatch on
      the floor begins to spin. The hatch opens and Aang airbends himself on to
      the bridge from below. Aang rushes forward out on to the bridge&#x27;s
      observation deck. He opens his glider, throws it into the air and jumps
      after it. He catches it, a happy expression on his face. Unfortunately,
      behind him, Zuko has jumped after him in pursuit. With a fierce cry of
      desperation, he grabs Aang&#x27;s foot. Both get up and square off yet again.
      Aang&#x27;s look of trepidation is tempered as he turns over his left shoulder
      to see Appa up in the sky gaining on Zuko&#x27;s ship.)

      Zuko: What is that?

      (Cut briefly to a shot from behind Katara and Sokka as they close in on
      the ship.)

      Aang: Appa!

      (Aang turns just in time to use his staff to block a fire blast from Zuko.
      He uses his staff as a helicopter to escape the blasts and comes back down
      on the edge of the deck, almost falling overboard. He regains his balance
      and blow three more fireballs before his staff is knocked away from him.
      He dodges a few more blasts before he is finally knocked overboard. Aang
      falls into the water below.)

      Katara (hysterical): Aang! No!

      (Cut to an underwater shot as Aang sinks.)

      Katara (voice-over as Aang sinks): Aang! Aang! AANG!

      (At Katara&#x27;s final scream, Aang&#x27;s eyes and tattoo&#x27;s glow white, an
      expression of determination forming on his face. He turns around in the
      water and begins to rise towards the surface. Around him, a mighty
      whirlpool of water begins to form. Cut to a wider underwater shot. Aang,
      at the center of a now monstrous, inverted tornado of water is propelled
      toward the surface at amazing speed. He breaks the surface in front of the
      ship, towering high over the bridge atop his swirling maelstrom of water.
      Cut to Zuko, who looks up at the swirling column of water and the Avatar
      at its pinnacle with dismay and fear. Aang lands on the deck, his eyes
      still aglow, and bends the water from the column around him in circle. He
      releases it and it expands outward in a shockwave that blasts Zuko and his
      men overboard. Cut to Sokka and Katara witnessing the scene from Appa&#x27;s
      back above.)

      Katara (incredulously): Did you see what he just did?
      Sokka: Now that was some waterbending!

      (Cut to Aang on the foredeck. He is on his knees, wobbling after the huge
      energy expenditure. He falls forward, the white energy fading from his
      eyes and tattoos. Appa lands and Katara and Sokka jump off to retrieve
      him.)

      Katara (worried): Aang! Are you okay?

      (Cut to Katara kneeling and holding Aang, Sokka beside her.)

      Aang (drained): Hey Katara. Hey Sokka. Thanks for coming.
      Sokka: Well, I couldn&#x27;t let you have all the glory.
      Aang: I dropped my staff.
      Sokka: Got it!

      (Sokka runs over to pick up the staff. As he picks it up, Sokka is shocked
      to see that Zuko holds the other end of it. Zuko was washed overboard, but
      held onto the part of Aang&#x27;s staff that was hanging out over the deck.
      Sokka butts Zuko in the head with the staff three times to the same �doink
      doink doink� sound effects that were heard when Zuko did the same to Sokka
      earlier. Zuko lets go and begins to fall to the water below, but grabs the
      anchor chain in time. He hangs by one hand.)

      Sokka: Ha! That&#x27;s from the Water Tribe!

      (Cut to a wide shot of Appa, Aang and Katara. Appa gets up, shaking off
      some water. Cut to some of the guards who had been washed way down the
      deck by Aang&#x27;s waterbending. They get up, preparing for combat. Katara
      picks up a stream of water from the deck and the guards pull back slightly
      in fear. She tries to whip the guards with the water, but instead freezes
      the water on the deck, including the water around Sokka&#x27;s feet in the
      background.)

      Sokka: Katara!

      (Sokka starts to chip away at the ice holding his feet with his boomerang
      while the soldiers move forward once again. Katara picks up another stream
      of water and throws it at the soldiers without looking. The camera then
      expands to show that they are now frozen in a thin sheet of ice. She turns
      and climbs back up on Appa.)

      Katara: Hurry up, Sokka!
      Sokka (to himself): I&#x27;m just a guy with a boomerang; I didn&#x27;t ask for all
      this flying and magic.

      (He finally frees himself and runs up Appa&#x27;s tail.)

      Sokka: Yip yip! Yip yip!

      (Once he is onboard, Appa rumbles and takes off. Cut to Iroh who has just
      emerged onto the deck after his nap, looking up to the sky.)

      Iroh (rubbing his eyes): Huh?

      (Cut to Appa rapidly flying away from the ship, then to Iroh helping Zuko
      back up onto the ship.)

      Zuko: Shoot them down!

      (As Appa gains altitude, Zuko and Iroh in unison launch a massive bolt of
      fire at Appa. Katara and Sokka look behind them in horror at the
      approaching fireball. Aang jumps to the back of the saddle and, using his
      staff like a baseball bat, airbends a gale that sends the fireball at a
      right angle away from Appa and into the ice cliff nearby. The fireball
      explodes, releasing a huge amount of ice from the cliff wall which falls
      into the narrow channel that Zuko&#x27;s ship is navigating. Zuko gasps in
      horror as the bow of the ship and indeed the entire channel is blocked up
      under an avalanche of ice. Cut to Aang, Katara and Sokka laughing as they
      fly away. Cut back to Iroh and Zuko on the foredeck of the heavily damaged
      ship.)

      Iroh: Good news for the Fire Lord. The nation&#x27;s greatest threat is just a
      little kid.
      Zuko: That kid, Uncle, just did this. (Shot widens to show the prow buried
      in ice) I won&#x27;t underestimate him again. Dig this ship out and follow
      them! (In the background, some soldiers are using controlled firebending
      to thaw out their compatriots frozen by Katara) As soon as you&#x27;re done
      with that.

      (Cut to a close up of Zuko&#x27;s eyes that fades to a long shot, sunset scene
      of Appa flying through the clouds. Then cut to a closer, profile shot of
      Appa and the kids flying through the clouds.)

      Katara: How did you do that? With the water? It was the most amazing thing
      I&#x27;ve ever seen.
      Aang (sitting cross legged on the bridge of the saddle, a slightly sad
      expression on his face): I don&#x27;t know. I just sort of... did it.
      Katara: Why didn&#x27;t you tell us you were the Avatar?
      Aang: Because... I never wanted to be.

      (Overhead, a cloud passes over them, momentarily blocking the fading
      sunlight. After it passes, they enter a shaft of sunlight.)

      Katara: But Aang, the world&#x27;s been waiting for the Avatar to return and
      finally put an end to this war.
      Aang (looking down sadly): And how am I going to do that?
      Katara: According to legend, you need to first master water, then earth,
      then fire, right?
      Aang: That&#x27;s what the monks told me.
      Katara: Well, if we go to the North Pole you can master waterbending.
      Aang (now smiling): We can learn it together!
      Katara: And Sokka, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll get to knock some firebender heads on
      the way.
      Sokka (somewhat dreamily): I&#x27;d like that. I&#x27;d really like that.
      Katara: Then we&#x27;re in this together.
      Aang (producing a scroll): All right, but before I learn waterbending, we
      have some serious business to attend to (he airbends himself over to them
      and opens the scroll to reveal a map) here, here, and here.

      (He points to two spots in the Earth Kingdom, and one spot on the southern
      Air Nomad islands in quick succession.)

      Katara: What&#x27;s there?
      Aang: Here (pointing to the eastern Earth Kingdom) we&#x27;ll ride the hopping
      llamas. Then waaaay over here (pointing to a spot on the southern Air
      Nomad islands) we&#x27;ll surf on the backs of giant koi fish. Then back over
      here we&#x27;ll ride the hog-monkeys. They don&#x27;t like people riding them, but
      that&#x27;s what makes it fun!

      (Cut to a long shot of Appa flying through the clouds at sunset, shafts of
      the suns fading light breaking through the clouds, then fade to white.)

水善国
土强国
火烈国
气和国
很久以前，四国和谐共处
但是，烈火国发动的战争改变了一切
只有掌握着所有种元素技能的降世神通才能阻止战争
但是在世界人民最需要他的时候，他却消失了
年后，我和我的哥哥发现了新的降世神通，
他是个名叫安昂的御气师
虽然他的御气术很棒，
但是在拯救苍生之前他还要学习很多
但是我相信安昂能够拯救这个世界。

-=降世神通=-
最后的气宗

第一卷
水
第二回
降世神通回归
太好了，安昂 回来了
我就知道，肯定是你发信号给火国的船队
你是想把他们引到这来吧
安昂 什么都没做，那是个意外
是啊，我们当时在船上，那上面有个陷阱，
我们...我们不小心被困住了
卡塔拉，你不应该到船那儿去，现在我们都有危险了
别怪卡塔拉，是我带她去那的，是我的错
外来人终于承认了，战士们离敌人远点
这个外人已经被驱逐出村了。
-索卡，你在干什么？
-我只是遵守对父亲的承诺。
- 我要保护你远离象他那样的威胁
-安昂不是我们的敌人
你们没意识到吗，安昂给我们村子
带来了我们失去已久的欢乐。
欢乐？欢乐能够打败火宗人吗？
-有时候你该试一试
-从我们的村子滚出去
奶奶，别让索卡这么做
卡塔拉，你知道那艘船是我们的禁地
索卡是对的，我想最好让御气师离开
那好吧，让我也一起被驱逐吧。来，安昂，咱们走。
-你这是要去哪？
-索卡答应我带我去北极找个御水术老师
-跟我去吗？太棒了
-卡塔拉，难道你为了他要离开你的村子，你的家人吗？
卡塔拉，我不想破坏你和家人的关系
这么说你要离开南极？这就要走了吗？
-感谢你和我一起玩企鹅滑行
-你要去哪？
应该是回家吧，看看其他御气师
喔，我都年没打扫我的小屋了，还真是期待哪
-很高兴认识大家。
-让我们看看你的飞天野牛咋飞~
来吧，阿柏，你能行的。驾，驾
我就说嘛，压根就不会飞
安昂，别走，我会想你的
我也想你的
走吧，伙计
-卡塔拉，一切都会过去...
-这下你满意了，我失去了成为御水师的唯一机会
听好了，找好掩护，火国的军队随时都可能杀过来
- 但是我要小...
-不能解散~
是啊，我也喜欢她。
他们去村子了~
阿柏，在这儿等我
天哪
不是吧~
索卡，赶快躲开！
你们把他藏在哪了？
他大概也是这么大年纪，掌握所有四种元素的技能
我知道你们藏着他
毫无畏惧！
- 嘿，卡塔拉。嘿，索卡
-嗨，安昂，你能来太好了
- 你是在找我吗？
-你是御气师？你就是降世神通？
- 安昂是降世神通？
-不可能吧
这些年来我费劲心思磨练，苦练功夫等来的降世神通居然只是个孩子?
你也没比我大几岁啊？
如果我跟你们走，你能答应我放过村里人吗？
安昂，不要啊，你不能这么做
卡塔拉，别担心，我会没事的
我不在的时候帮我照顾阿柏。
班师回国，我们回家了。
索卡，我们得追上那艘船, 安昂救了我们的部落，现在我们得救他。
-卡塔拉，我
-为什么你看不出他是站在我们一边的
-如果我们不帮助他，还有谁能帮他。
我知道你不喜欢他，但是我们欠他一个人情...
-卡塔拉！
你是要继续唠叨，还是上船跟我走？
索卡.
-上船，我们去救你的男朋友
-他才不是...
-随便了~
你们个想去哪？
你会用到着这个的，将要有很长的路要走
很久以来我已经不知道什么叫希望了，
我的小御水师是你，是你给我带来了希望
还有你我的小勇士，照顾好你的妹妹
没问题，奶奶
安昂 是降世神通，他是这世界唯一的希望
你们找到他是因为你们和他有缘
你们的命运息息相关
我们驾着这独木舟可赶不上战船
-阿柏
-你就喜欢给我泼凉水，是吧？
这玩艺将成为我给的父王最好的礼物。
你应该不知道什么是父亲吧，由和尚养大的孩子~
把降世神通给我关起来，把这个放到我的船舱去
帮我把这个放到他的船舱去
我猜你们以前肯定没见过御气师
咱们打个赌吧，我双手绑在后面也能收拾你们
给我安静点
降世神通逃跑了！
飞，飞啦，高飞...
阿柏，我们需要你的帮忙，安昂也需要你的帮助
上，向上，升起...
索卡不相信你能飞，但是我信你阿柏
飞吧，难道你不想救安昂吗？
安昂说啥来着，咦哈? 哈普-哈普? 呜哈? 嗯，驾驾？
索卡，你做到了
他飞了，他飞了，卡塔拉，他...
我是说，不就是能..飞..嘛
你肯定没看到我的棍子吧？
还是谢谢了
打搅了
我的棍子
看来我小瞧你了
那是什么？
阿柏
安昂，不
安昂，安昂，安昂
- 你看到他刚才用的那招了吗？
-好像是御水术
安昂，你没事吧
嘿，卡塔拉，嘿，索卡，能见到你们真好
不能让你把功劳都占了
-我的棍子掉在那边了
-我帮你拿
哈~刚才那下是替我们部落揍你的
卡塔拉
索卡，快点
我只是个会飞去来去的平凡人，
我可不想飞，也不想会什么魔法
驾，驾，驾，驾
把他们打下来
对烈火王来说这真是个好消息，火国最大的敌人居然是个孩子
孩子？叔叔，我可不会再小看他了
赶紧让船启动，追上他们
算了，等你们完事的吧
你刚才是怎么用御水术的？这是我见过的最奇妙的事了
我也不知道，就是做了
你为什么之前不告诉我们你就是降世神通
因为我不想成为降世神通
但是，世界需要降世神通，需要你让世界重新步入正轨
我知道，我会做的
传说你需要依次掌握水，土，最后是火的绝技
-和尚们是这么告诉我的
-如果你去北极的话，你就能学习御水术了
我们可以一起学
-索卡，你肯定可以在途中消灭几个御火师
-正合我意，不错
那我们就一起努力吧
好吧，但在我们学习御水术之前，我们还有些事要做
我们要到这里，这里和这里
那儿有啥？
我们在这骑骆驼，然后我们在这骑巨鱼冲浪，在到这骑肥猪猴
他们不喜欢人骑，但越是这样才越有趣呢！
