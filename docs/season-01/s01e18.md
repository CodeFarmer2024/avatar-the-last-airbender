      Scene I

      (Opening shot of some open water. Almost instantly a koala otter
      backstrokes into view. He looks up as a shadow passes over him. He ducks
      beneath the waves as Appa passes just overhead. Cut to Sokka leaning over
      Appa&#x27;s saddle, looking backwards over his beaver like tail in the
      direction they came from.)

      Sokka (petulantly): I&#x27;m not one to complain, but can&#x27;t Appa fly any
higher?

      (Cut to a side view of Appa flying across an ice field in the open ocean.
      He is clearly tired. He glides lower, his feet brushes the water. Cut to a
      view atop Appa looking forward to Aang in Appa&#x27;s driver&#x27;s seat, Katara in
      the foreground behind him in the saddle, who turns around and answers
      Sokka angrily.)

      Aang: I have an idea, why don&#x27;t we all get on your back and you can fly us
      to the North Pole?
      Sokka: I&#x27;d love to! Climb on everyone (he wiggles his butt at everyone),
      Sokka&#x27;s ready for takeoff!

      (Momo jump up on Sokka in response to his invitation.)

      Katara: Look, we&#x27;re all just a little tired and cranky because we&#x27;ve been
      flying for two days straight.
      Sokka: And for what? We can&#x27;t even find the Northern Water Tribe. There&#x27;s
      nothing up here.

      (Suddenly a noise is heard up ahead. Ice is moving rapidly towards Appa.
      Cut to Aang who screams and pulls Appa&#x27;s reigns to starboard. Appa banks
      right and avoids the ice, but almost tips his passengers off the saddle,
      who hang on for dear life. Appa then banks left as another jet of ice
      erupts out of the waves, but this one slams into Appa&#x27;s underside, who
      drops in an uncontrolled spin into the water. Out of the icebergs several
      ornate wooden skiffs come to surround Appa. They are manned by people in
      water tribe garb.)

      Katara: They&#x27;re waterbenders! We found the Water Tribe!

      (Cut to a wide shot of Appa trapped in ice, surrounded by Water Tribe
      ships, then cut to a Fire Navy port. Ships line the harbor in the
      background. In the foreground is a tent surrounded by guards. Cut to
      Admiral Zhao, looking at a map of the world, back to the camera.)

      Zhao: He&#x27;s heading north. The Northern Water Tribe. The Avatar needs to
      master waterbending. He&#x27;s looking for a teacher.

      (Zhao has turned around to address the others in the room. His officers
      sit cross legged on the floor.)

      Captain Li: Then what are we waiting for? Let&#x27;s go get him!
      Zhao: Patience, Captain Li. This isn&#x27;t some little Earth village we can
      just march into. The Water Tribe is a great nation. There&#x27;s a reason
      they&#x27;ve survived a hundred years of war. The frozen tundra is treacherous.
      The landscape itself is an icy fortress. We&#x27;ll need a massive invasion
      force.

      (Cut back to Appa swimming in formation with the Water Tribe boats. Aang
      gets up and points ahead.)

      Aang: There it is!

      (Cut to a view of an ice wall with towers and turrets.)

      Katara (from o.c. with wonder): The Northern Water Tribe�
      Sokka: We&#x27;re finally here�

      (Cut to a view of one of the water tribe skiffs, where the waterbender
      crew waterbends in unison. Cut to a view of the city wall, where the
      waterbenders have removed a semi-circular opening to reveal a tunnel that
      leads into the city. Cut back to Appa and the kids, one of the
      waterbenders on the skiff in the foreground. He motions them forward and
      Appa swims in. Cut to a view inside the tunnel as Appa swims in, then cut
      to the lock where the tunnel opens into. Switch to an overhead view
      showing that the lock is square and that the waterbenders line the tops of
      the lock&#x27;s four walls. The three sides of the lock not adjacent to the
      main wall have water behind them almost to the height of the city wall.
      The waterbenders open sluice gates along the three walls of the lock to
      raise the water level. The wall opposite the main city wall begins to
      lower itself, ultimately to free a path for Appa to continue. Cut to a
      closer view of Aang and Katara.)

      Katara: I can&#x27;t believe how many waterbenders live up here!
      Aang: We&#x27;ll find a master to teach us, no problem!

      (Cut to a long shot of the lock wall dropping beneath the water line, with
      a few boats waiting in the channel beyond as Appa swims out. Cut to a
      frontal shot of the kids on Appa, smiling and looking around them in
      wonder. Shift to long, overhead panorama shot of the city. It is made of
      ice and is breathtakingly beautiful. It also has three interior walls in
      addition to the main city walls. All the way in the back is apparently
      some sort of citadel or temple. Cut to an overhead shot of the roof of one
      of the buildings in the city. An older man and a young boy watch as Appa
      follows a Water Tribe skiff through the canals. Soon more people join
      them. In fact, as they go, small crowds of people begin to gawk at them
      from houses and foot bridges. Aang waves at them as they pass. The city is
      loaded with beautiful streams, waterfalls and fountains. They pass another
      boat with a waterbender and a beautiful young Water Tribe woman with
      white, elaborately styled hair and a slightly purplish coat rather than
      the normal blue. Sokka focuses on her, blushes and tried to follow her by
      running down Appa&#x27;s tail.)

      Katara (from o.c.): This place is beautiful.
      Sokka (looking dreamily at the girl as he boat moves away): Yeh, she is.

      (Cut to a view of the rapidly waning, almost new moon. The view pans down
      to reveal Prince Zuko&#x27;s ship at dock. The sound of a stringed instrument
      can be heard playing a simple staccato tune. Cut to a close up of the
      instrument and the hand playing it. The view pans up to reveal the
      musician to be Lieutenant Jee. The tune is then accompanied by drums. Cut
      to a wider shot that reveal four men around a camp fire on the main deck
      of the ship. One of them is Lieutenant Jee, another is General Iroh.)

      Iroh (singing slightly out of tune): Winter, spring, summer and fall.
      Winter and spring, summer and fall. Four seasons, four loves. Four
      seasons, four loves.

      (During the song, two crewmen dance in front of the fire. Then a group of
      masked Fire Nation soldiers board the ship including Admiral Zhao. The
      music stops as the intruders are noted. Iroh and the others turn to look
      at the newcomers.

      Cut back to a view of the Northern Water Tribe city which is quickly
      replaced by a shot of three Water Tribe men playing huge kettle drums in
      unison. Cut to a wide shot of a plaza near the main citadel. A huge
      fountain dominates the rear of the plaza. On either side huge pews made
      out of ice provide seating for many onlookers. The closest side of the
      plaza shows the backs of the city&#x27;s rulers as well as the guests of honor,
      Aang and his friends. Cut to a frontal shot of the city dignitaries table.
      Sokka is on the far side and down below Appa can be seen. A couple of
      attendants bring him a huge pallet of food. He roars and then and they run
      screaming, with Sokka smiling at this in the foreground. Appa begins to
      eat. Cut back to a view of the center of the plaza, where four attendants
      lower some sort of huge steaming platter of food or something onto a stage
      in front of them.)

      Chief Arnook (standing to address the crowd): Tonight, we celebrate the
      arrival of our brother and sister from the Southern Tribe, and they have
      brought with them someone very special, someone whom many of us believed
      disappeared from the world until now. (Indicating Aang) The Avatar! (The
      crowd cheers.) We also celebrate my daughter&#x27;s 16th birthday. (He backs up
      out of the frame to reveal the beautiful girl with the white hair, flanked
      by two attendants, walking up to the table. They all bow, smiling.)
      Princess Yue is now of marrying age.

      (Sokka looks at her with wide eyes.)

      Princess Yue: Thank you, father. May the great Ocean and Moon Spirits
      watch over us during these troubled times.
      Chief Arnook: Now, Master Pakku and his students will perform!

      (The Chief motions towards three men who now stand on the dais in front of
      the fountain opposite the dignitaries&#x27; table. The center man is clearly
      the eldest with a bald head, but long white hair on the sides of his head
      and down his back. The begin waterbending water from three enormous
      amphorae in front of them. The crowd begins to cheer. Cut to Aang and
      Katara who look at each in utter delight while they clap. As the
      waterbending show continues, cut to Sokka stuffing his face full of food.
      A figure walks behind him and sits down next to him. It is Princess Yue.
      He gulps his mouthful and tries to strike a cool pose next to her.)

      Sokka (in a cheesy voice): Hi, there. Sokka, Southern Water Tribe.
      Princess Yue (smiling and bowing slightly): Very nice to meet you.
      Sokka (after a brief pause, trying desperately to strike up a
      conversation): So�uh�you&#x27;re a Princess! (She nods and smiles) You know,
      back in my tribe, I&#x27;m kinda like a Prince myself!

      (Shot pans left to reveal Katara.)

      Katara: Ha! Prince of what?
      Sokka (angry): A lot of things! Uh, do you mind? I&#x27;m trying to have a
      conversation here!
      Katara (with a mock bow): My apologies, Prince Sokka.
      Sokka (turning back to Yue and trying to recover): So it looks like I&#x27;m
      gonna be in town for awhile. I&#x27;m thinking maybe we could�(then lamely) do
      an activity together?
      Princess Yue: Do an �activity�?

      (Sokka, sweating, pauses then stuffs his mouth with some stuff on the
      table. Screens widens to the left to show Katara clearly enjoying her
      brother&#x27;s lame attempt at courting.)

      Katara: Very smooth.

      (Cut to a long shot of the plaza fountain. In front of it stand the Chief,
      Master Pakku and Aang.)

      Chief Arnook: Master Pakku, meet your newest student, the Avatar.

      (Aang bows.)

      Master Pakku: Just because you&#x27;re destined to save the world, don&#x27;t expect
      any special treatment.
      Aang (trying to ignore this): My friend and I can&#x27;t wait to start training
      with you � after we relax for a couple days.
      Master Pakku: If you want to relax, then I suggest visiting a tropical
      island. If not, I&#x27;ll see you both at sunrise. Good night.

      (Master Pakku walks away, Chief Arnook shrugs. Cut to a shot of Prince
      Zuko in a dark cabin on his ship. His arms are folded across his chest.
      The door at the far end of the cabin opens and Iroh leans in. Zuko does
      not look at him.)

      Zuko: For the last time, I&#x27;m not playing the sumki horn.
      Iroh: No, it&#x27;s about our plans. There&#x27;s a bit of a problem.

      (Zhao enters the room behind Iroh.)

      Zhao: I&#x27;m taking your crew.
      Zuko (turning to face Zhao): What!?
      Zhao: I&#x27;ve recruited them for a little expedition to the North Pole.
      Zhao: Uncle, is that true?
      Iroh: I&#x27;m afraid so. He&#x27;s taking everyone. (Putting his arm over his face
      in woe) Even the cook!
      Zhao: Sorry you won&#x27;t be there to watch me capture the Avatar. But I can&#x27;t
      have you getting in my way again.

      (Zuko charges him in anger, but Iroh prevents him from tackling Zhao, who
      walks over to inspect the curved broadswords on the wall used � the same
      used by the Blue Spirit to free the Avatar. Cut to a close up of Zhao&#x27;s
      face, swollen in anger as he recognizes the blades. Cut to a series of
      flashbacks as he remembers the Blue Spirit wielding the blades during the
      escape. He takes one off the wall, then cut to Zuko&#x27;s face, his eyes wide
      and mouth open, clearly recognizing the danger he is in. Iroh, visible
      over Zuko&#x27;s shoulder, does not. Cut back to Zuko, who begins practicing
      with the sword he has removed from the wall.)

      Zhao: I didn&#x27;t know you were skilled with broadswords, Prince Zuko.
      Zuko: I&#x27;m not. They&#x27;re antiques. Just decorative.
      Zhao: Have you heard of the Blue Spirit, General Iroh?
      Iroh: Just rumors. I don&#x27;t think he is real.
      Zhao: He&#x27;s real all right. He&#x27;s a criminal, an enemy of the Fire Nation.
      (He hands the broad sword to Iroh) But I have a feeling that justice will
      catch up with him soon. (Zhao moves to exit the cabin) General Iroh, the
      offer to join my mission still stands if you change your mind.

      (Zhao closes the door behind him. Cut back to a morning shot back in the
      Northern Water Tribe City. Katara and Aang are walking towards a huge ice
      staircase up to the citadel.)

      Katara: I&#x27;ve waited for this day my whole life! I finally get to learn
      from a real waterbending master!

      (Cut to a shot of Master Pakku manipulating a blob of water. The screen
      pans right to reveal Aang and Katara behind him.)

      Aang: Good morning, Master Pakku!
      Master Pakku (dropping the water blob with a grimace): No, please, march
      right in, I&#x27;m not concentrating or anything.
      Aang: Uhh� this is my friend, Katara, the one I told you about?

      (Katara bows while Aang introduces her. Master Pakku looks over at her as
      if she were a bug.)

      Master Pakku (creating an ice chair for him to sit down in): I&#x27;m sorry. I
      think there&#x27;s been a misunderstanding. You didn&#x27;t tell me your friend was
      a girl. In our tribe, it is forbidden for women to learn waterbending.

      (Cut to a shot panning up Katara&#x27;s body, her face clearly reflecting the
      anger she feels. Cut to commercial break.)

      Scene II

      (When the show returns, cut back to long, overhead shot of the Northern
      Water Tribe city, looking back from the main wall back to the citadel. Cut
      back to a close up of Katara.)

      Katara: What do you mean you won&#x27;t teach me? (Walking up to Pakku) I
      didn&#x27;t travel across the entire world so you could tell me �no�!
      Master Pakku: No.
      Katara (hands on her hips): But there must be other female waterbenders in
      your tribe!
      Master Pakku: Here the women learn from Yugoda to use their waterbending
      to heal. I&#x27;m sure she would be happy to take you as her student despite
      your bad attitude.
      Katara: I don&#x27;t want to heal, I want to fight!
      Master Pakku: I can see that. But our tribe has customs, rules.
      Katara: Well your rules stink!

      (Aang enters the frame behind her in the background.)

      Aang: Yeh! They&#x27;re not fair. If you won&#x27;t teach Katara, then �
      Master Pakku (standing up): Then what?
      Aang: Then I won&#x27;t learn from you!

      (Aang turns and begins to walk away.)

      Master Pakku: Well have fun teaching yourself. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll do a great
      job.
      Katara: Wait! (To Pakku) Aang didn&#x27;t mean that.

      (Katara runs over to Aang&#x27;s retreating figure and grabs him by the
      shoulder to stop him.)

      Katara: You can&#x27;t risk your training for me. You have to learn from Master
      Pakku. Even if he is a big jerk.

      (Aang nods his head glumly, and swings his body around lazily to face his
      new master. Cut to a close up of Pakku&#x27;s smug face.)

      Master Pakku: Why don&#x27;t we get started then.

      (Master Pakku waterbends a huge rush of water at Aang, washing him out of
      the frame. Cut to Sokka running over a footbridge that spans one of the
      city&#x27;s many canals. Beneath the bridge, Princess Yue&#x27;s boat slowly moves
      along.)

      Sokka: Princess Yue! Good morning! (Coming up beside her boat on the
      sidewalk along the side of the canal and walking with her boat as it
      floats down the canal.) Hey, how about that picnic last night? Boy, your
      Dad sure knows how to throw a party.
      Princess Yue: I&#x27;m happy you enjoyed yourself.
      Sokka: Well, it wasn&#x27;t as much fun after you left.

      (Princess Yue looks away, blushing. Cut back to Sokka, a huge, toothy
      smile on his face. He blushes too.)

      Sokka: So, I&#x27;m still hoping we can see more of each other.
      Princess Yue: Do an �activity�, you mean?
      Sokka (eyes wide, clearly excited): Yes! At�a place! For� some time!
      Princess Yue: I&#x27;d love to! (She points ahead, cut to a shot of a bridge in
      front of them, she continues from o.c.) I&#x27;ll meet you on that bridge
      tonight.
      Sokka: Great! I&#x27;ll see you � aahh!

      (Sokka drops out of sight. The sidewalk has ended, but the was to busy
      gawking at Yue to realize it. Yue laughs and waves goodbye to him as he
      hauls himself out of the water.)

      Princess Yue: Sorry!
      Sokka (to himself, as he falls over backwards to lie flat on the
      sidewalk): That&#x27;s okay, it was worth it. (Shot zooms out and rotates) See
      you tonight.

      (Cut back to the Fire Navy port from earlier in the episode. Zhao begins
      to speak from o.c.)

      Zhao: I&#x27;m very impressed.

      (Cut to Zhao seated at his desk, a small chest and a lamp in front of him.
      Two men face him � pirates last seen in �The Waterbending Scroll.�)

      Zhao: You all seem highly qualified for the mission I have in mind.

      (A pair of hands reaches for the chest and pulls it towards him. Cut a
      view from Zhao&#x27;s p.o.v. to show the entire pirate gang, including the
      Captain (complete with his green, reptilian parrot), who has opened the
      chest to reveal glowing riches inside. The Pirate Salesmen removes a gold
      piece and bites it.)

      Pirate Barker: That&#x27;s some tasty gold!

      (The Captain grabs it and puts it back in the chest. He leans forward and
      looks skeptically into the camera.)

      Pirate Captain: What do you need us to do?
      Zhao (smiling): I believe you&#x27;re acquainted with Prince Zuko?

      (Cut to a brief shot of the outside of a building in the Northern Water
      Tribe city, then cut to a view from inside the building. Inside, a man
      sized dummy lies flat on a stone bed in the middle of the main chamber.
      The dummy has pathways or channels etched all over its surface. A hand
      bends water through the pathways which flow white the same way Katara&#x27;s
      hands did when she healed herself in �The Deserter.� Cut to a wide shot of
      the room. Around the stone bed sit half a dozen students while the
      teacher, an old woman, demonstrates. Katara has entered the room on her
      left.)

      Katara: Um, hi. Are you Yagoda?
      Yugoda: Are you here for the healing lesson?

      (Katara surveys the room. The students are all girls who look younger than
      she. Katara looks at the ground glumly.)

      Katara (walking forward and sitting down): I guess I am.
      Yugoda: Welcome! Welcome!

      (Cut to Aang moving around a blob of water while Master Pakku, sitting
      cross-legged with a bowl of steaming soup in front him, gives instruction.
      Aang looks unhappy and sullen.)

      Master Pakku: You&#x27;re moving the water around, but you&#x27;re not feeling the
      push and pull.
      Aang (through gritted teeth): I&#x27;m trying!
      Master Pakku (lifting the soup and sucking out some food from it): Maybe
      that move is too advanced for you. Why don&#x27;t you try an easier one?

      (Aang throws the water to the ground in frustration. Cut back to an
      exterior shot of the healer&#x27;s building, then cut to the inner chamber. The
      young girls are taking the dummy out on its stretcher, leaving Katara and
      Yugoda. Katara walks over to her teacher.)

      Katara: Thanks for the lesson.
      Yugoda: So, who&#x27;s the lucky boy?
      Katara: Huh?
      Yugoda (pointing at her neck): Your betrothal necklace. You&#x27;re getting
      married, right?
      Katara (smiling): No, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ready for that yet. My grandmother
      gave my mother this necklace, and my mother passed it down to me.
      Yugoda (looking closely at the necklace): I recognize this carving! I
      don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t realize sooner! You&#x27;re the spitting image of Kana!
      Katara (starting backwards in surprise): Wait, how do you know my
      Gran-Gran&#x27;s name?
      Yugoda: When I was about your age I was friends with Kana. She was born
      here, in the Northern Tribe.
      Katara (looking away): She never told me.
      Yugoda: Your grandmother had an arranged marriage with a young
      waterbender. He carved that necklace for her.
      Katara: If Gran-Gran was engaged, why did she leave?
      Yugoda: I don&#x27;t know. That&#x27;s always been a mystery to me. She left without
      saying goodbye.

      (Cut back to a night shot of Prince Zuko&#x27;s ship at the dock. The crew
      stand outside the ship and one of them yells �good luck!�, then cut to a
      shot of Prince Zuko lying in bed in the foreground of his cabin. The door
      opens and Iroh sticks his head in.)

      Iroh: The crew wanted me to wish you safe travels.
      Zuko: Good riddance to those traitors.
      Iroh: It&#x27;s a lovely night for a walk. Why don&#x27;t you join me? It would
      clear your head. (Iroh&#x27;s smiles falls away as Zuko refuses to respond.)
      Or, just stay in your room and sit in the dark. Whatever makes you happy.

      (Iroh leaves, closing the door behind him. Cut to an exterior view of the
      ship from the prow looking aft. Iroh&#x27;s silhouette can be seen walking down
      the gang plank to the dock. He is humming the song he was singing earlier.
      As he passes by the Pirate Captain&#x27;s green parrot flies by. Cut to a long
      shot of the ship. Some time evidently passes by before the next shot, but
      it is still the same night. Cut to a view of the main deck where the
      pirates are climbing aboard. The Pirate Barker goes over the opposite
      railing of the ship and lowers down some ropes with hooks at end. Below in
      a small skiff are two other pirates with barrels of explosives. They
      attach the hooks to the barrels which are then hoisted up. One of the
      pirates on the deck almost drops the barrel, but recovers.)

      Pirate Barker (whispering): Careful with the blasting jelly!

      (Cut to the Pirate Barker turning one of the door latches. It makes a much
      larger noise then he thought, then cut to Zuko who sit straight up in bed,
      alarmed.)

      Zuko (getting up): Uncle? (Opening his door to look out into the corridor)
      Uncle, is that you?

      (He jumps out into the hallway in a fighting stance. Warily, he advances
      to the bridge, ready for instant combat around every corner. Cut to the
      main deck where the pirates light a trail of gunpowder and then run off
      the ship. Cut back and forth between Zuko walking around the bridge and
      the lit trail of gunpowder. At last, Zuko turns and looks out one of the
      bridge windows to see the Pirate Captain&#x27;s green parrot. It croaks at him
      and then takes off. Cut to a close of Zuko&#x27;s eyes as the realization of
      what the bird&#x27;s appearance means strikes him. It is too late. Cut to the
      lit gunpowder reaching the barrels of blasting jelly. The bridge deck and
      main deck explode, blasting Zuko out the bridge window. This explosion is
      repeated several times from different angles, the last being a long, wide
      shot. Another explosion rips the vessel completely open mid ship. Cut to
      Iroh walking down a dirt road, the explosion in full bloom behind him. He
      has turned to look. Cut to a frontal view, his face contorted with
      surprise and fear.)

      Iroh: Zuko!

      (He begins to run back to the ship. Cut back to the burning ship. Iroh&#x27;s
      reaches the dock, burning debris falling all around him. Cut to a wider
      shot from some distance behind him. He is dwarfed by the massive fireball
      that was Zuko&#x27;s ship. Cut back to Iroh&#x27;s face, well lit by the
      conflagration.)

      Iroh (lowering his face in sadness): Zuko�

      (Cut to a long shot of the remnants of the burning ship. Fade to a shot
      panning down of a canal in the Northern Water City. It is night. Cut to
      Sokka running up the winding staircase attached to the bridge where Yue
      waits to meet him. He sidles up to her. She looks disturbed.)

      Sokka: Hi, Princess Yue. (Offering her something) I made you something. I
      carved it myself.

      (Cut to a shot of Sokka&#x27;s hand. In it rests a rudely carved wooden
object.)

      Princess Yue: It&#x27;s a bear.
      Sokka: Actually, it&#x27;s a fish (he turns it sideways), see it has a fin.
      Princess Yue: Oh. (Beginning to break down.) I&#x27;m sorry! I made a mistake.
      (She turns away from him) I shouldn&#x27;t have asked you to come here!

      (Yue runs away, out of the frame. Cut back to a stunned and hurt Sokka. He
      throws the carving into the canal in anger. Fade to an exterior shot of a
      small house in the Water City, apparently where the kids are staying. Cut
      to the inside where Sokka, Katara, Momo and Aang sit on a huge rug.)

      Katara: How&#x27;s warrior training going?

      (In response Sokka kicks a bag on the floor in anger, falls to his knees,
      and then flops on the bag, using it as a pillow.)

      Aang: That bad?
      Sokka: No, it&#x27;s Princess Yue. I don&#x27;t get it. One minute she wants to go
      out with me and the next she&#x27;s telling me to get lost! (Pause.) So how&#x27;s
      waterbending training?

      (Katara flops onto her sleeping bag, depressed. Her hood flops over her
      head.)

      Aang: Master Poophead won&#x27;t teach her because she&#x27;s a girl.
      Sokka: Why don&#x27;t you just teach her, Aang?
      Katara (raising her head with a smile): Why didn&#x27;t I think of that?
      (Getting up.) At night, you can teach whatever moves you learned from
      Master Pakku. That way you have someone to practice with and I get to
      learn waterbending. Everyone&#x27;s happy!
      Sokka: I&#x27;m not happy.
      Katara: But you&#x27;re never happy. Come on, Aang.

      (She leaves, Aang in tow. Sokka remains lying down, a sour expression on
      his face. Momo chitters at him, then cut to an overhead shot of Katara and
      Aang at a canal. They are on some sort of ledge or small plaza that ends
      with steps that go down into the canal water. The camera pans down as Aang
      raises a whip of water out of the canal.)

      Aang: Master Pakku said this move is all about sinking and floating.

      (He sends the water over to Katara who starts to bend it.)

      Katara: I got it!

      (The water begins to whip around her very fast, then up and out of the
      frame entirely. Cut to Aang, holding the sides of his head in excitement.)

      Aang: That was amazing!
      Katara: That wasn&#x27;t me.

      (Camera pans rapidly up and to the right to reveal Master Pakku standing
      on the bridge above him. He has the water Katara had been bending. He
      freezes it and breaks into pieces in a shower of icicles that embed
      themselves in the bridge before him.)

      Aang: I�I was just showing Katara a few moves.
      Master Pakku: You have disrespected me, my teachings, and my entire
      culture.
      Aang: I&#x27;m sorry, I �
      Master Pakku: You are no longer welcome as my student.

      (He turns and walks away, leaving an astonished Aang and Katara. Cut to
      commercial break.)

      Scene III

      (When the show returns, the opening shot is of the plaza where the feast
      was held. The shot pans down a bit to reveal a long shot of Katara, Sokka
      and Aang in front of the Chief, Princess Yue, Master Pakku, and what looks
      to be the tribe&#x27;s council who all sit on a dais.)

      Chief Arnook: What do you want me to do? Force Master Pakku to take Aang
      back as his student?
      Katara: Yes � please!
      Chief Arnook: I suspect he might change his mind if you swallow your pride
      and apologize to him.

      (Cut to Katara with Aang in the background. The idea is hateful to her and
      it shows. Her eyes moves to Aang and she turns to look at him. She turns,
      back, clearly unhappy.)

      Katara: Fine.

      (Cut back to Master Pakku, who smiles smugly.)

      Master Pakku: I&#x27;m waiting, little girl.

      (Cut to Katara&#x27;s hand, which balls up instantly to a fist at this insult,
      then shift to a view of her from Master Pakku&#x27;s p.o.v.)

      Katara: No! No way am I apologizing to a sour old man like you!

      (A she speaks, cracks open in the floor beneath her as her waterbending
      abilities begin to get out of control. She ends up by pointing directly at
      Master Pakku, her finger almost in his face. At the conclusion of her
      statement, the massive water pots at either end of the dais.)

      Aang: Uh, Katara�

      (Cut to a close of Katara.)

      Katara (a look of challenge on her face): I&#x27;ll be outside � if you&#x27;re man
      enough to fight me!

      (Princess Yue draws breath in surprise as the men stiffen. Cut to a long
      shot of the room with Katara in the foreground leaving the building. The
      others stand frozen. Cut back to Aang and Sokka.)

      Aang: I&#x27;m sure she didn&#x27;t mean that.
      Sokka: Yeh, I think she did.

      (Cut to a close up someone pouring tea. The red background suggests we
      have moved to a Fire Nation scene. We have. Cut to a wider shot of Iroh
      and Zhao having tea opposite each other at a low table. A map of the world
      hanging on the wall occupies much of the shot behind them.)

      Zhao: I&#x27;m devastated to hear about Prince Zuko. (Cheesily) Just
devastated.

      (Cut to a close up Iroh&#x27;s pained face, his eyes closed.)

      Iroh (opening his eyes): The Fire Lord will not be pleased he learns who
      was responsible.
      Zhao (suspicious, frowning): You know who�was behind the attack?
      Iroh: Yes�(slamming table with his fist) pirates! We had a run in with
      them awhile back.

      (Cut to a close of Zhao&#x27;s mouth as his frown turns to a smile.)

      Iroh: They wanted revenge.
      Zhao (after taking a sip of tea): So, have you reconsidered my offer?
      Iroh (bowing): Yes, I accept. It will be an honor to serve as your
      general. (Raising his glass in a toast) To the Fire Nation!
      Zhao (raising his glass): To victory!

      (Camera pans up and fades to an outside view of the naval base and the
      Fire Nation flag fluttering in the wind. Cut back to the Northern Water
      Tribe city where the three kids are walking down the long steps of the
      citadel.)

      Sokka: Are you crazy, Katara? You&#x27;re not gonna win this fight!
      Katara (taking off her coat and throwing it at Sokka, hitting him in the
      face): I know! I don&#x27;t care!
      Aang: You don&#x27;t have to do this for me. I can find another teacher.
      Katara: I&#x27;m not doing it for you! Someone needs to slap some sense into
      that guy!

      (They reach the bottom of the steps as Master Pakku appears at the top.
      Katara turns and sees him.)

      Katara: So, you decided to show up? (He walks past her.) Aren&#x27;t you gonna
      fight?
      Master Pakku (without turning): Go back to the healing huts with the other
      women where you belong.

      (Insanely angry, Katara draws a water whip out of the ground and whips
      Pakku on the back on the neck. He stops.)

      Master Pakku (turning to face her): Fine. You want to learn to fight so
      bad, study closely!

      (Cut to a wide shot from the view of someone standing on the steps of the
      citadel. On either side of the plaza at the bottom of the steps there are
      two huge pools. Master Pakku grabs most of the water in each and bends it
      around himself. Katara runs at him, but she is flung backwards when she is
      hit by the water. She stands, now perhaps ten feet from Pakku. He bends
      the water in a wall around both of them. It spins faster and faster
      creating a whirlpool effect.)

      Master Pakku (mockingly): Don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;m not going to hurt you!

      (The whirlpool constricts, but before Katara is knocked back down she
      swings her arm, almost as if she were swinging a baseball bat, deflecting
      the wall of water off on a different trajectory. Cut to a shot of the
      spectators, including Aang and Sokka. The errant wall of water hits Sokka
      and blows him out of them frame with an exclamation of �OW!� Cut to a view
      from behind Master Pakku as Katara runs at him with a water whip. He
      raises a ramp of ice in front of her which she slides up and then back
      flips off, landing neatly on the guardrail of the citadel steps behind
      him. Pakku liquefies the ramp and throws it at her while catching her feet
      in ice. The wave breaks around Katara, however, as she bends it out of the
      way.)

      Katara: You can&#x27;t knock me down!

      (The crowd behind her cheers.)

      Aang: Go Katara!

      (Cut to a shot from Pakku&#x27;s p.o.v. A very angry and determined Katara is
      bearing down on him. Shift to a side view as Pakku raises a sheet of ice
      between him and the raging girl. Katara liquefies the ice as she reaches
      it and throws several blows at Pakku, one of which narrowly misses his
      face, before he washes her out of his way and into one of the pools with a
      wave of water. Cut to a head shot of Pakku, who smiles with satisfaction.
      She breaks the surface of the water and the crowd cheers. Katara then
      raises a circular pedestal of ice out of the fountain pool and begins to
      shoot slivers of the top of the pedestal at Pakku. Cut to Pakku who breaks
      them as they arrive with swift Tai Chi movements. The last one however
      narrowly passes to the left side of his face. The frame rates slows down
      noticeable with a sound effect for further accent. Pakku can see his own
      reflection in the passing sheet of ice � it is both surprised and
      dismayed. The frame rate speeds up again as it passes out of the shot.
      When it is gone, he turns back to Katara with a bewildered and, perhaps,
      somewhat impressed look on his face. Cut back to Katara who is bending a
      stream of water around her which she throws at Pakku, who catches it and
      begins to twirl it around him. Katara runs at him again, but he washes her
      backwards and onto her behind when he releases the stream of water. Cut to
      a close of Aang and Sokka, who await in stunned anticipation of the
      outcome. Cut back to a side close of Katara&#x27;s face, her hair disheveled,
      breathing heavily. Then shift to a front view of Katara as she jumps back
      up in a bending stance. She makes a motion and the segmented pillars of
      ice behind Pakku collapse, narrowly missing him.)

      Master Pakku: Well, I&#x27;m impressed. You are an excellent waterbender.
      Katara: But you still won&#x27;t teach me, will you?
      Master Pakku: No.

      (With a cry of effort, Katara raises water near her feet, freezes it, and
      send it in a rolling wave along the floor to Pakku, who is raised up on a
      pillar of ice when the wave reaches him. He liquefies the base of the ice
      column and begins to flow forward on it, like an iceberg riding along a
      river. Katara has raised her own stream of water and knocks him off his
      iceberg, but Pakku grabs Katara&#x27;s water and freezes it in an arc around
      her with he slides around. As he exits the arc he knocks her down, her
      necklace falling to ice near her. Cut to a close shot of Katara, breathing
      heavily, her long black hair now loose around her. Cut to Pakku raising a
      huge column of water out of one of the pools, making a whirlpool out of it
      in the air and then freezing it into shards the whirlpool disintegrates.
      Cut back to Katara now standing in front of Pakku, but the shards land
      closely all around her. She is trapped. She struggles in vain against her
      prison of ice, her hands and arms unable to move.)

      Master Pakku (walking towards her): This fight is over.
      Katara: Come back here! I&#x27;m not finished yet!
      Master Pakku: Yes, you are.

      (He stops in surprise, picking up the necklace.)

      Master Pakku (in wonder): This is my necklace!
      Katara: No it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s mine! Give it back!
      Master Pakku: I made this sixty years ago � for the love of my life.
      (Katara&#x27;s ice prison liquefies behind him, freeing her.) For Kana.
      Katara: My Gran-Gran was supposed to marry you?

      (Cut to an exterior shot of the Fire Navy base. Ships line the dock. Shift
      to a shot of Iroh walking down a corridor in Zhao&#x27;s ship toward the
      camera, a guard walking in the other direction. They stop when abreast of
      each other and begin to whisper.)

      Iroh: Our plan is working perfectly. Zhao doesn&#x27;t suspect a thing.
      Zuko (removing his guard mask): You didn&#x27;t have to do this.
      Iroh: No nephew of mine is going to stow away on a ship without some
      backup!
      Zuko: Thank you, Uncle.
      Iroh (hearing a sound): Someone&#x27;s coming! (Zuko replaces his mask) Stay
      hidden until we get to the North Pole and the Avatar will be yours! Good
      luck!

      (They separate and exit the frame. Cut back to the Water City.)

      Master Pakku (still holding the necklace, sadly): I carved this necklace
      for your grandmother when we got engaged. I thought we would have a long,
      happy life together. I loved her.
      Katara: But she didn&#x27;t love you, did she? It was an arranged marriage.

      (Cut to a shot of Yue and Sokka. The Princess&#x27; eyes water and Katara&#x27;s
      pronouncement.)

      Katara (walking up to Pakku): Gran-Gran wouldn&#x27;t let your tribe&#x27;s stupid
      customs run her life. That&#x27;s why she left. It must have taken a lot of
      courage.

      (Cut back to Yue and Sokka. She begins to cry openly and runs away. The
      shot expands to show Aang and Chief Arnook next to Sokka.)

      Aang: Go get her.

      (Sokka runs after her. Cut to a night shot of the city. Yue stand alone on
      the same bridge as before. A tear streams down her face as she hears
      footsteps approaching.)

      Princess Yue: What do you want from me?
      Sokka: Nothing. I just want you to know, I think you&#x27;re beautiful� and, I
      never thought a girl like you would even notice a guy like me.
      Princess Yue: You don&#x27;t understand.
      Sokka: No, no, see, that&#x27;s the thing. I think I do understand now. You&#x27;re
      a princess, and I�I&#x27;m just a southern peasant.
      Princess Yue: No, Sokka�
      Sokka: It&#x27;s okay. You don&#x27;t have to say anything. (Turning to leave) I&#x27;ll
      see ya around, okay?

      (She grabs him and kisses him.)

      Sokka: Okay, now I&#x27;m really confused! Happy � but confused!

      (He holds her hands in his.)

      Princess Yue: I do like you! A lot. But, we can&#x27;t be together � and not
      for the reason you think. It&#x27;s because� (she pulls down the collar of her
      coat to reveal a necklace)� I&#x27;m engaged. I&#x27;m sorry!

      (She runs away. Fade to a morning shot of the plaza at the base of the
      citadel. The ruined pillars of ice are visible in the background from the
      battle the day before between Katara and Pakku. Near the steps, several
      students, including Aang, stand before Master Pakku. Aang is waterbending
      around a ball of water. He throws the ball of water o.c. after a few
      motions.)

      Master Pakku: Not bad! Not bad! Heheh! Keep practicing and maybe you&#x27;ll
      get it by the time you&#x27;re my age!

      (Aang looks momentarily unhappy, but then turns with a smile at the sound
      of footsteps behind him. Cut to Katara running to the group.)

      Aang: Hey Katara!

      (She bows to Pakku.)

      Master Pakku (icily): What do you think you&#x27;re doing? It&#x27;s past sunrise.
      (Smiling) You&#x27;re late.
      Aang: Good to see ya here.
      Katara (smiling): You too.

      (Cut to a wide shot of them practicing, then fade to a shot of the upper
      decks of Zhao&#x27;s ship. The view pans down to reveal Iroh and Zhao on the
      outside walkway around the bridge.)

      Zhao: My fleet is ready. Set a course for the Northern Water Tribe.

      (Cut to a panning overhead shot. It reveals dozens of Fire Navy ships
      firing up their engines in preparation to launch the final assault on the
      Northern Water Tribe. Fade to white.)

第十八回
御水宗师

其实我也不想发牢骚，可是阿柏不能再飞高点吗？
不如这样吧，
我大家都骑到你肩上，让你驼我们去北极
求之不得呢
大家上来吧，“索卡号”即将起飞。
(模模还真给面子，呵呵)
这都连续飞行两天了，
大家都很累了，难免有点浮躁。
真不知道咱们在瞎转什么
压根就没看到北极水族的影，
简直就是在白忙活
是御水师啊。我们终于找到党组织了
神通往北去了
定是去找北极水族
他需要掌握御水术，
肯定是去拜师的
那咱们还等什么？应该赶快去抓他！
着嘛急，李上校
水善国可是个强国，不容小觑
它可不像那些土国小镇可任你蹂躏践踏
水善国能在百年战争中屹立不倒，是有一定的原因的
更何况，在冰冻的苔原上行军极其危险，
那种地貌俨然是一座天然的冰制堡垒
若没有雄厚的军力且不可贸然进犯
我们到了！
这就是北极水族啊
我们终于到了
肯定有数不清的御水师们住在这里！
那找位御水老师来教咱们，肯定是轻而易举喽！
这里好漂亮啊
是啊，地方美人更美啊
**冬或春，夏或秋**
**冬又春，夏又秋**
**吾爱遍四季**
**四季皆吾爱**
今夜
 我们举杯同欢，欢迎从南极远道而来的兄弟姐妹，
更要欢迎一位特殊的来客，
时至今日许多人还以为他已经消失了，
他就是降世神通！
好事成双，今日也是我女儿的十六岁生日，
月公主现在已经到了大婚的年纪了
谢谢您，父亲
祈求伟大的海神和月神
保佑我们平安度过这段多事之秋
现在有请 帕库 大师和他的弟子为大家献艺！
你好啊，在下索卡，来自南方水族
幸会
哦，呃，你是公主吧！
要知道，在我族里我也算是个王子呢！
哈！俺咋没听说过呢
别捣乱，
没看见我在和别人聊天吗？
请您恕罪，索卡王子
你看，我可能还要在城里待些时日，
也许或许可能的话，咱们可以...
...一起搞个活动啥的？
搞...活动？
不错，我看好你哟~
帕库大师，这位是降世神通，
您的新徒弟
别指望打着“拯救苍生”的旗号来糊弄我，
我可不会给你特别优待的
我和我的朋友都迫不及待的想投入您的门下学习，
等我们休整几天后就可以开始了
想放松偷懒就去找个热带岛屿吧，
要练功的话明早就过来报道，
晚安
我再说最后一次， 别想让我吹号
    （Sumki horn 艾洛在御水天书那集买的）
不是来找你吹号的，
是咱们的计划出了点岔子
我要带走你的船员
什么？！
我要招募他们去北极进行“科考探险”
皇叔，是真的吗？
没错，
全都被征走了，
居然连厨子也不放过！
很遗憾不能让你亲眼目睹我活捉降世神通，
我可不敢冒险让你乱了我的计划
祖寇殿下，原来你还会使双刀呢，我都不知道
我哪会使刀
那是淘来的古董，摆设罢了
您听说过蓝魔吗，艾洛将军？
我还以为是别人以讹传讹呢，莫非真有其人
的确真有其人，
他是个罪犯，是烈火国的敌人
不过天网恢恢，他终究是逃不了的
艾洛将军，如果您愿意加入我的队伍，
我可是随时欢迎哟
这一天我已经等了一辈子了，
终于可以向真正的御水大师学习了！
早上好啊，帕库大师！
还真早，来吧，反正你在这儿，
我也没办法集中精神练功了
呃...这是我的朋友，卡塔拉，我昨天跟您提到过
抱歉，咱们之间有点小误会
你没告诉我你的朋友是个丫头，
在我们族中女人是不允许学御水术的
你为什么不肯教我？
我翻山越岭、跋山涉水的，
好不容易到这儿，你一个不字就想把我打发了
不行
难道你们这儿没有能御水的女性吗？
当然有，不过她们都从师于尤格达学习水疗之术，
哪怕你是这种暴脾气，
她也一定会乐意收你为徒的
我不要学什么水疗，
我要战斗！
那我可是爱莫能助，正可谓“族有族法，家有家规”
你们这都是些什么烂规定啊
这太不公平啦！
倘若你不肯教卡塔拉，那...
那又怎么样？
那我也不跟你学了！
那你就自学成才吧，了不起啊，你可是降世神通呢
且慢！
安昂不是那个意思
你不能为我就这么放弃修炼的机会，
你得跟他学好御水术，
好汉不吃眼前亏
那现在咱们开始？
月公主，
早上好啊！
我说，昨晚的野餐真丰盛啊，
你老爸真是个宴会专家啊
很高兴你能尽兴
不过，你走后就没什么意思了
那个，我还是希望咱们能常出来聚聚
搞个搞活动啥的？
没错啊，找个风景幽雅，
闲人免进的地儿
我很乐意！那今晚就在那座桥上见面吧
太好了！回头见...啊！
抱歉啊！
没关系，
为你淹死也值啊，晚上见
不错，
你们看起来一定会胜任我给你们的那个工作
味不错，是真的
你要我们做什么？
你们和祖寇是老相识了吧？
呃，您好
请问您是尤格达吗？
你想必是来学水疗术的吗
我想是吧
欢迎！欢迎！
你现在仅仅学会了御水的动作，
御水的精髓就在那“一推一拉”之间
我在努力着呢
也许这招对你来说太难了，
早知道教你一招简单的好了
听您的课我不胜荣幸
那位幸运的小伙子是谁啊
-您在说什么呢？
-你不是戴着订婚项链嘛，
要结婚了吧？
没有啦，我可还没那个打算
这项链是从外婆那儿传下来的，
老妈又将它传给了我
我认得这个花纹！
瞧我这老糊涂，我居然没早认出来，
你简直和长得 康娜 长得一模一样
且慢，
你怎么会知道我姥姥的名字？
（更正第一二集的翻译，
Gran-Gran是姥姥不是奶奶，致歉）
我和康娜曾是朋友，那时我们只有你这么大。
她其实是在北极水族出生的
她从来都没跟我说过
你外婆曾和一个年轻的御水者有一纸婚约，
这项链就是他刻给你外婆的
既然姥姥订婚了，那她又为何要离开？
我也不知道，
那件事对我来说永远是个谜
她就那样不告而别了
好运啊~
船员们托我来祝你一帆风顺
这些叛徒，走就走吧，我也落得清静
今晚天气不错的，
咱们去散散步吧，
可以保持头脑清醒
如果你喜欢在屋里独处，那也不错，反正你高兴就好
小心点，那可是爆破浆啊！
皇叔？
皇叔，是你吗？
祖寇！
祖寇...
你好啊，月公主
这个送给你，
可是我亲手雕的哟
你刻了一只熊？
其实是条鱼
你看，这不是鱼鳍吗？
很抱歉！是我的错，
我不该叫你来这儿的
武士训练得进行得咋样啊？
那么糟吗？
是月公主让我烦心
真想不通。她一会儿答应
与我约会，一会儿又叫我滚蛋！
你们御水术练得咋样了？
那个混蛋师傅因为卡塔拉是女生而不教她御水术
有你教她不就成了吗，安昂？
我咋就没想到呢？
你白天跟帕库大师学，晚上呢就回来教我
这样一来可以有人陪你练功，我也能学到御水术了，
皆大欢喜！
除了我
你一直都这样，真懒得理你，走吧，安昂
帕库师傅说这招的精髓在于掌握“一沉一浮”的感觉
我学会了！
你太强了
不是我做的
我...我只想是给卡塔拉演示演示
你居然无视我，无视我对你的教导，无视我们的传统
请您原谅...
从现在开始，你已经不是我的徒弟了
你要我怎么办？逼迫帕库大师
收回成命，重新收安昂为徒？
拜托，求您了！
我想如果你能收起你那傲慢的脾气，
并诚心道歉，他也许可以改变心意
好吧
我等着呢，丫头
算了！我决不会跟你这个糟老头道歉的
呃，卡塔拉。。。
有种你就跟我到外面院里比划比划
她说的话你可不要当真啊
我看她这回可是认真的
祖寇王子的意外我深感震惊
  那是相当震惊啊
要是烈火王查出谁是真凶的话，一定会龙颜大怒的
你知道谁是幕后主使？
没错，
定是海盗干的！
我们曾经和他们有点过节
他们早就想好了要报复我们
那么，我之前的提议您考虑的怎么样了？
嗯，我考虑过了，
能够辅佐您作战我深感荣幸
敬烈火国！
此战必胜！
卡塔拉你疯了吗？
你是赢不了他的
我知道！
但是我豁出去了
你大可不必这么做，
我可以再找其他老师的
我这么做不是为了你！
我就想敬那老头两耳光，让他清醒清醒
哦，你终于露面了
你不准备出招吗？
你还是乖乖的和其他女人们学习水疗术去吧。
好，既然你敬酒不吃吃罚酒，那就休怪我不客气了
别怕，我不会伤着你的！
你是打不垮我的！
加油，卡塔拉！
看不出来你还有两下子嘛
你是个出色的御水师
可是你还是不肯授我武艺，对吗？
没错
就到此结束吧
给我回来！我跟你没完
省省吧
这是我的项链！
不是，那是我的！还给我！
这是我六十年前为我的心上人刻的，是做给康娜的
和姥姥有一纸婚约的人是你？

一切进行得很顺利
赵并未起疑心
皇叔其实你是不必这么做的
怎么能放心让我的侄子只身犯险呢，
你需要人和你里应外合
谢谢你，皇叔
有人来了！
注意隐蔽，到了北极，神通就是你的了
祝咱们好运吧
这条订婚项链是我为你外婆做的
我原以为我们能白头偕老
我爱她
但她不爱你，对吧？
那可是桩包办婚姻
姥姥不愿意让那些陈规控制她的人生，
所以她出走了
那还真的需要很大的勇气呢
快去追她
你到底想怎样？
不想怎样
我想让你知道，我觉得你很美...
没想到像你这样的女孩会注意到我这样的小子
你不明白
不，
不，我知道了
我想我终于懂了
你是个公主，而我...我只是个南方的草民
不，索卡
没关系，你不需要解释
后会有期吧
我现在彻底糊涂了！
高兴是高兴，但仍然很糊涂
我确实喜欢你！
很喜欢，但是我们不能在一起，
但并不是你想的那个原因
实际上，
我已经订婚了
真的很抱歉
不错，不错！
哼哼！没准你到我这岁数就能练成了！
嗨，卡塔拉！
你还来干什么？
都日上三竿了
你可是迟到了
很高兴你能来
是啊
我的舰队已经整装待发了
向北极水族前进
=未完待续=-

水善国
土强国
火烈国
气和国
很久以前，这四大国和谐共处
然而，烈火国发起的战争结束了和平
只有同时掌握四种元素的降世神通才能结束战争
然而在大家最需要他的时候，他却消失了
年后，我和哥哥发现了转世的降世神通，
他是个御气师，名叫“安昂”
尽管他的御气术着实厉害
在拯救苍生之前，他要学的还有很多
但是我坚信
安昂 能拯救这个世界
