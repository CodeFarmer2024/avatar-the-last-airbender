      Scene I

      (The episode opens with a brief daytime shot of a shoreline. The surf
      breaks against jagged rocks that jut out of the ocean close to shore.
      Presumably nearby, a water tribe blade has been stuck in the ground in a
      forested area. Aang&#x27;s hand enters the frame, then cut to a wider shot of
      Aang picking up the blade, Sokka coming up behind him.)

      Aang: Hey look! A sword made out of a whale&#x27;s tooth.
      Sokka (grabbing it): Lemme see that.

      (Sokka walks forward, examining the blade. Fade to a flashback of daytime
      at the South Pole. In the distance, many Water Tribe boats are being
      loaded with supplies. View pans left to reveal the back of a younger
      Sokka, a view soon replaced by a frontal shot of the boy. He holds his
      boomerang, a pained look of anticipated loss on his face. Flashback fades,
      his older face superimposed briefly on his younger face.)

      Sokka: This is a water tribe weapon. (To Aang, behind him over he left
      shoulder.) See if you can find anything else.
      Katara (entering wider shot): Did someone lose something?
      Aang: (looking in a bush): No, we found something.

      (Cut to Sokka brushing away some leaves from a broken arrow on the ground.
      He picks it up and inspects it.)

      Sokka: It&#x27;s burned.

      (He throws it away and walks over to a tree with burn marks.)

      Sokka: There was a battle. Water tribe warriors ambushed a group of
      firebenders.

      (He looks down at the ground and begins to walk downhill as he interprets
      the signs left in the earth.)

      Sokka: The firebenders fought back, but the warriors drove them down this
      hill�

      (He runs down the hill, the others in tow. They soon come to the beach
      seen in the first clip.)

      Aang: So then what happened?
      Sokka: I don&#x27;t know. The trail ends here.
      Katara (pointing o.c. to the right): Wait! Look!

      (Cut to a shot of a beached water tribe boat.)

      Sokka (from o.c.): It&#x27;s one of our boats!

      (They all run to it. Cut to a wide shot of them staring up at the boat.)

      Katara: Is this� Dad&#x27;s boat?
      Sokka (rubbing the ship&#x27;s prow and smiling): No, but it&#x27;s from his fleet.
      Dad was here.

      (Cut to a close up of Iroh&#x27;s face. He is drinking tea. He drinks and then
      cut to a shot of he and Zuko sitting at a table in a cabin on Zuko&#x27;s ship.
      Iroh pours Zuko some tea after he takes his sip.)

      Iroh: Ahh! See, Prince Zuko, a moment of quiet is good for your mental
      well being.

      (As Zuko raises the cup to drink, a shock causes it to splash the tea all
      over he face. He wipes it away and gets up from table, making angry
      noises. Cut to the foredeck, where a young, dark haired woman has appeared
      on deck riding a massive and hideous monster. Members of Zuko&#x27;s crew
      scatter as the monster climbs the railing and onto the deck.)

      June: Get back! We&#x27;re after a stowaway.
      Zuko: There are no stowaways on my ship.

      (The monster, a shirshu, proceeds to rip out a chunk of deck plating and
      hurls it aft. It sticks its head into the gaping hole, then cut to the
      shirshu&#x27;s p.o.v. It can see smells. The stowaway&#x27;s odor shows up as a
      smoky green trail on the screen which it follows. Nearby a barrel falls
      over and a man crawls out, whimpering. The man crawls out onto the
      foredeck where the shirshu quickly whips the back of his neck with its
      tongue. He falls instantly onto the deck, conscious but paralyzed, with
      Iroh and Zuko looking on in the background.)

      Zuko: He&#x27;s paralyzed.
      June (picking the man up): Only temporarily. The toxins&#x27;ll wear off in
      about an hour. But by then he&#x27;ll be in jail and I&#x27;ll have my money.
      Zuko: But how did you find him on my ship?
      June (petting her monster as she gets back in the saddle): My shirshu can
      smell a rat a continent away.
      Iroh (admiring her): Well, I&#x27;m impressed.

      (She cracks her whip and the shirshu bolts off the ship and down the dock.
      Cut back to Iroh.)

      Iroh (stroking his chin): Very impressed.

      (Cut to a shot of the full moon. The screen pans down to reveal the kids
      and Appa around a campfire in front of the water tribe boat they found on
      the beach. Katara and Aang are asleep, Sokka is not. He tends the fire in
      silence, lost in thought. A flashback begins. It is again daytime on the
      South Pole. The younger Sokka, his face painted for war, struggles to
      carry a sleeping bag and gear toward the boats. Cut to an older man,
      Hagoda, Katara and Sokka&#x27;s father, helping to load a boat. He sees his son
      and walks to him.)

      Hakoda: Sokka�
      Sokka: I&#x27;m coming with you.
      Hakoda: You&#x27;re not old enough to go to war, Sokka, you know that.
      Sokka (his eyes pleading): I&#x27;m strong! I&#x27;m brave! I can fight! Please,
Dad!
      Hakoda (putting a hand on his shoulder): Being a man is knowing where
      you&#x27;re needed the most, and for you right now that&#x27;s here protecting your
      sister.
      Sokka (eyes watering): I don&#x27;t understand.
      Hakoda: Someday you will. (Sokka drops his sleeping bag and hugs his
      father.) I&#x27;m going to miss you so much.

      (Sokka cries, his father&#x27;s hand on his head. The flashback fades to the
      present. In the present, Sokka stares at the fire for another moment
      before hearing a sound and standing up.)

      Sokka: Who&#x27;s there?

      (Cut to a bandaged water tribe man approaching the camp.)

      Bato: Sokka?
      Sokka: Bato?
      Aang (waking up in the background): Who the what now?
      Katara: Bato!
      Bato: Sokka! Katara! (Hugging them both.) It is so good to see you two!
      Oh, you&#x27;ve grown so much.
      Aang (bowing): Hi, I&#x27;m Aang.
      Sokka: Where&#x27;s Dad?
      Katara: Is he here?
      Bato: No, he and the other warriors should be in the eastern Earth Kingdom
      by now.

      (The wind picks up and they all shiver.)

      Bato: Brr! This is no place for a reunion. Let&#x27;s get inside.

      (He puts his arms around Katara and Sokka&#x27;s shoulder and motions Aang to
      follow. Cut to Appa beginning to walk away from the campfire after them,
      then cut to another shot of the moon. The camera pans down to show a
      monastery complex as Bato begins to narrate from o.c. Then the kids, Appa
      and Bato appear walking in through the main gate.)

      Bato: After I was wounded, your father carried me to this abbey. The
      sisters have cared for me ever since. (To one of the nearby women.)
      Superior, these are Hakoda&#x27;s children. They&#x27;ve been traveling with the
      Avatar. I found them by my boat.
      Superior (bowing): Young Avatar, it gives me great joy to be in your
      presence. Welcome to our abbey.
      Aang (bowing): Thank you! It&#x27;s truly an honor to be here. If there&#x27;s
      anything �
      Sokka (cutting Aang off): What smells so good, Bato? (He sniffs the air.)
      Bato: The sisters craft ointments and perfumes.
      Sokka: Perfume? Maybe we could dump some on Appa? Because he stinks so
      much! Am I right?

      (Cut to Bato and Katara, who are not amused.)

      Bato: You have your father&#x27;s wit.

      (Cut to a wooden door opening to reveal Bato and the two kids.)

      Katara: Bato! It looks like home!
      Sokka: Everything&#x27;s here, even the pelts!

      (The pair examine the comforts of the room. Cut to Aang holding Momo,
      looking a little disconcerted.)

      Aang: Yeh, nothing&#x27;s more comforting than dead animal skins.

      (Momo hops down and examine the head of a bear skin rug. The mouth of the
      bear closes suddenly, scaring Momo into climbing back up to Aang&#x27;s
      shoulder. Cut to a pot over the fire in the center of the room. Katara&#x27;s
      hand opens the pot and then the camera zooms back to show her looking at
      Sokka to her left, with Baton sitting down on the opposite side of the
      fire.)

      Katara: No way! Stewed sea prunes?
      Bato: Help yourself.
      Sokka: Dad could eat a whole barrel of these things.

      (Katara puts some in bowl, then cut to Aang with a bowl in his hands. He
      sniffs it and makes a sound of disgust. Cut to a wider shot of the room.
      Aang sits back from the group having put the untouched bowl of stew beside
      him. As the conversation continues, Momo tastes the stew, spits it back
      out and runs away.)

      Katara: Bato, is it true you and Dad lassoed an arctic hippo?
      Bato: It was your father&#x27;s idea. He just dragged me along. Well, the hippo
      did the dragging.
      Aang: Hey, I ride animals too! One time there was this giant eel �
      Sokka (cutting Aang off): So who was it that came up with the great
      blubber fiasco?
      Bato (laughing): You knew about that?
      Katara: Everyone does.
      Aang: What&#x27;s that story?
      Sokka: It&#x27;s a long one, Aang, some other time.

      (Aang looks sad in the background. The others don&#x27;t notice.)

      Katara: You and Dad had so many hilarious adventures.
      Bato: Not all of which were hilarious at the time, but everything&#x27;s funny
      with hindsight. (Then to o.c.) Aang, put that down (cut to Aang wearing
      some kind of animal skin headdress), it&#x27;s ceremonial and very fragile.

      (Aang puts it back on the wall and walks off dejected while the others
      continue from o.c. He sits down, back to the wall, near the door. Momo
      joins him.)

      Sokka: Was it you or Dad that put an octopus on your head and convinced
      Gran-Gran you were a water spirit?
      Bato: Your dad wore the octopus, but (in a sinister tone) I did the spooky
      voice.

      (Cut to a scene that same night of the exterior of a squat, three story
      building with many windows. As the camera pans in, it is clear that the
      building is packed with people. Cut to a view of the front door where
      Junee&#x27;s shirshu can be seen to its right. A few other patrons of the
      establishment can be seen. Suddenly someone gets thrown through the wall
      above the door, landing in the foreground and crying out painfully upon
      impact. Cut to a close of the tattoo of a curled red snake on June&#x27;s right
      shoulder, then pan the camera zooms backward to reveal June arm-wrestling
      a beefy man. They are in a tavern that is filled to capacity with
      revelers. The beefy man is sweating in his attempt to best the beautiful
      bounty hunter. She does not even appear to be trying. Suddenly, Zuko
      appears, forcing his way through the crowd.)

      Zuko: Out of my way! Step aside, filth!

      (Iroh appears in Zuko&#x27;s wake with a smile, addressing the people his
      nephew has just thrust aside.)

      Iroh: He means no offense! I&#x27;m sure you bathe regularly.

      (Zuko and Iroh at the table where June is arm-wrestling. During the
      conversation the beefy man continues to grunt and struggle against June&#x27;s
      grip.)

      Zuko: I need to talk to you.
      June: Well, if it isn&#x27;t my new friends, Angry Boy and Uncle Lazy.

      (Iroh laughs heartily for a moment before June ends the contest with one
      swift movement. The crowd erupts and a lot of money changes hands, much of
      it ending up in a big pile in front of June.)

      Zuko: Your beast trashed my ship. You have to pay me back.
      June (raking in the pile of coins): Aww, I&#x27;d love to help you out, but I&#x27;m
      a little short on money. (To the crowd) Drinks on me!
      All : YEHHH!!!!
      Zuko (grabbing her hand as she raises her cup to her lips): Money isn&#x27;t
      what I had in mind.

      (Cut to a close up of one of the lamps outside the front door of the
      tavern. Moths fly around it. Cut to a view of Zuko holding Katara&#x27;s
      necklace.)

      Zuko (from o.c.): I need you to find someone.
      June: What happened? Your girlfriend run off on you?
      Zuko: It&#x27;s not the girl I&#x27;m after, it&#x27;s the bald monk she&#x27;s traveling
with.
      June: Whatever you say.
      Zuko: If you find them, I&#x27;ll consider the damage to my ship paid for.
      June: Heh! Forget it.

      (She turns and begins to climb into her saddle.)

      Iroh: Plus we&#x27;ll pay your weight in gold.

      (She smiles, gets down and walks over to Iroh.)

      June: Make it your weight and we got a deal.
      Iroh (laughing): You got it!
      June (grabbing the necklace from Zuko&#x27;s hand): Get on.

      (June walks over to the shirshu and lets it smell the necklace. Cut to
      p.o.v. of shirshu. The necklace reeks with a purple stench. It scans the
      area and finds Katara&#x27;s trail. Cut back to a view of the shirshu&#x27;s
      slobbering mouth full of teeth, then camera cuts to June jumping into the
      saddle in front of Zuko and Iroh. They take off. Cut to a long, exterior
      shot of the abbey still that same night. Bato begins to speak o.c., then
      cut back to his room as the conversation continues. Aang is still slumped
      against the wall away from the others. His eyes are closed.)

      Bato: There&#x27;s something I should tell you kids. I&#x27;m expecting a message
      from your father.
      Katara: Really?
      Sokka: When?
      Bato: Any day now. Your father said he&#x27;d send a message when they found
      the rendezvous point. If you wait here until the message arrives you can
      come with me and see your father again.

      (Aang has straightened up at this and looks over at his friends, clearly
      worried that he might lose them.)

      Sokka: It&#x27;s been over two years since we&#x27;ve seen Dad! That would be so
      incredible. Katara?
      Katara: I do really miss him. It would be great to see Dad.

      (The Avatar looks downcast at this, loneliness and worry on his face. He
      walks out of the room and shuts the door behind him and walks down the
      road away from the abbey. Cut back to the others.)

      Bato: It&#x27;s been far too long, hasn&#x27;t it? I&#x27;m not sure when word will
      arrive, but when it does�
      Sokka (less exuberantly): It would be great, but we can&#x27;t. We have to take
      Aang to the North Pole first.
      Katara: Even if we had time to wait for the message, who knows how far
      we&#x27;d have to travel. We don&#x27;t have time for a long detour.
      Bato: I&#x27;m sure your father would understand and be proud that his children
      are helping the Avatar.

      (Cut to a moonlit shot of the beach, where Aang sits huddled on the prow
      of Bato&#x27;s boat.)

      Aang: I can&#x27;t believe they would leave me.

      (He looks up at the sound of a messenger approaching on some kind of
      bipedal lizard.)

      Messenger: I&#x27;m looking for Bato of the Water Tribe.
      Aang: Uh, I know Bato.
      Messenger (giving Aang a scroll): Make sure he gets this.

      (Messenger rides off. Aang, with Momo peering over his shoulder, opens the
      scroll to reveal a map.)

      Aang: It&#x27;s the map to Sokka and Katara&#x27;s Dad!

      (He crumples it in anger, stuffs it into his left sleeve, and crouches
      back down. Cut to wider shot of him on the boat then fade to commercial
      break.)

      Scene II

      (The show returns with a long shot of the abbey&#x27;s exterior. Cut to a shot
      of the door to Bato&#x27;s room opening. Camera zooms back to reveal Aang
      entering in the background, Sokka, Katara and Bato in the foreground,
      still sitting around the fire.)

      Aang: Hey everyone! Sorry I was gone so long.
      Katara: Hey Aang, I didn&#x27;t notice you left.
      Aang (with exaggerated happiness): Yup, but now I&#x27;m back. Sure�could go
      for some delicious sea prunes!

      (He sits down, grabs a bowl and begins to munch. After a few seconds he
      spits them back out. Cut to Katara and Bato looking at him strangely, with
      Sokka&#x27;s head entering the screen from the right, a similar expression on
      his face. Cut to a daytime view of the deserted town on the hillside seen
      in �The Blue Spirit.� At the base of the hill in the old, decrepit town
      square, the Herbalist is crouched near the ground harvesting some plants.
      Near her is her cat, Miyuki, who tenses and hisses at the sound of the
      shirshu approaching. The Herbalist rises and the shot cuts wide to show
      the old woman looking at the three atop the shirshu.)

      Herbalist (unafraid): Out for a bit of fresh air, are we?
      Zuko: We&#x27;re looking for someone.
      Herbalist: I hope it&#x27;s not Miyuki. (Looking down at her cat) Miyuki, did
      you get in trouble with the Fire Nation again?

      (The cat meows and backs away.)

      June: The Avatar&#x27;s been through here. Let&#x27;s keep moving.

      (She cracks her whip and the shirshu takes off. Cut to a shot of the
      abbey&#x27;s exterior, and then to a shot of Appa lying down munching on hay.
      Near a huge pile of hay, Aang airbends another load of hay in front of
      Appa, who takes a huge bite. The map falls out of Aang&#x27;s sleeve. Cut to
      close up of the crumpled map as a hand picks it up.)

      Sister (from o.c.): Ha! I caught you! You should be ashamed of
      yourself�(Aang looks guilty and afraid)�littering in the courtyard.
      Aang (taking the map back): I&#x27;m sorry! I&#x27;ll take care of this.

      (He bows nervously and the sister walks off. He stuffs the map back under
      his hood. Cut to a panning shot of the woods that ends back on the beach.
      Bato and the kids are approaching his boat.)

      Bato: This ship is sentimental to me. It was built by my father.

      (Aang looks down and sees the tracks of the messenger&#x27;s beast. He airbends
      the entire trail away, then turns back to the others, whistling guiltily.)

      Sokka: Is this the boat he took you ice-dodging in?
      Bato: Yeh, it&#x27;s got the scar to prove it. Huh. How about you, Sokka? You
      must have some good stories from your first time ice-dodging?
      Katara: He never got to go. Dad left before he was old enough.
      Bato: Oh, I forgot, you were too young.
      Aang: What&#x27;s ice-dodging?
      Bato: It&#x27;s a rite of passage for young water tribe members. When you turn
      fourteen your Dad takes you� you know what (putting a hand on Sokka&#x27;s
      shoulder, who looks downcast), you&#x27;re about to find out.

      (Sokka smiles. Cut to a shot of Aunt Wu&#x27;s village from �The
      Fortuneteller.� The mighty lava floes, hardened to stone by Aang&#x27;s
      airbending, surround the village, ominous, but harmless. Cut to a view of
      the main square from one of the alleys. People run into it screaming,
      fleeing the shirshu and its riders who soon enter the frame. Cut to Aunt
      Wu, looking serene, if not entirely pleased. Cut to a wider shot of Aunt
      Wu standing to the left of the closed circular door to her building. The
      shirshu and its riders enter the frame.)

      Zuko: Why are we stopping?
      June: Because the girl must of spent a lot of time here.
      Zuko (grabbing the necklace from June&#x27;s hand): We have no time for this!

      (He gets down and shows the shirshu the necklace again. He narrowly avoids
      getting zapped by its tongue.)

      Zuko: Hey, watch it!

      (Iroh laughs.)

      June: Oh look, he likes you.

      (Cut to Aunt Wu looking up at Iroh.)

      Aunt Wu: Care to hear your fortune, handsome?
      Iroh (smiling): At my age there is really only one big surprise left, and
      I&#x27;d just as soon leave it a mystery.

      (June whips the shirshu, who takes off once again as Aunt Wu watches. Cut
      to Bato&#x27;s boat cutting through the waves near the shore. Treacherous rocks
      are visible in both the foreground and background.)

      Bato: Ice-dodging is a ceremonial test of wisdom, bravery and trust. In
      our village it was done by weaving a boat through a field of icebergs.
      Sokka: How are we supposed to ice-dodge without ice?
      Bato: You will be dodging�those.

      (Bato points ahead. Cut to a pan left shot that reveals the path ahead of
      the boat to be a veritable thicket of stalagmite like rocks. Cut back to
      Bato leaving the tiller as Sokka and Katara move aft.)

      Bato: Sokka, you steer and call the shots. Lead wisely. Katara, you secure
      the mainsail. The winds can be brutal, so be brave. Aang, you control the
      jib, without your steady hand we all go down. Your position is about
trust.
      Aang (Looking nervous and guilty): I know that! Why wouldn&#x27;t I know that?
      I&#x27;m the Avatar! I know about trust.

      (Aang pouts and folds his hands across his chest. Bato walks over to the
      bow and sits down.)

      Bato: For this to be done right I cannot help. You pass or fail on your
      own.

      (Cut to the kids, Sokka at the tiller, the other two holding on to their
      respective sails, all looking frightened as the ships speeds towards the
      rocks. Cut back to Sokka, whose expression hardens.)

      Sokka: Aang, ease up on the jib. Katara, steady! Aang, less sail! (Sokka,
      sweating, pulls the tiller to his right) Katara, give him room!

      (Cut to Aang hauling rope, then cut to the ship weaving in and out of the
      rocks.)

      Sokka: Aang! Helm to lee! Helm to lee!
      Aang: What does that even mean!?

      (All three struggle against their loads, cut to the ship narrowly missing
      a huge pile of rock.)

      Sokka: Great job!

      (Cut to overhead shot of the ship entering a cul de sac, ringed by jagged
      rocks, at high speed. Cut back to Katara, Bato getting up in the
      background.)

      Katara: There&#x27;s no way through!
      Sokka: We can make it!
      Bato: Sokka, you&#x27;ve already proven yourself, maybe we should �
      Sokka: Aang, I&#x27;m gonna need air in that sail! (Aang nods.) Katara, I want
      you to bend as much water as you can between us and those rocks! (Cut to
      zooming close up of Sokka&#x27;s determined face.) Now!

      (Aang and Katara jump to it. Aang starts pushing wave after wave of air
      into the sail, while Katara raises the ship up on an accelerating wave of
      water. The wave carries the speeding ship safely over the ring of jagged
      rocks. Sokka falls back on the tiller with a sigh of relief, cut to the
      others smiling. Fade to a long shot of the boat back on the beach, then
      cut to Bato&#x27;s bandages hand scooping some black face paint out of a bowl.)

      Bato: The spirits of water bear witness to these marks. For Sokka, the
      mark of the wise, the same mark your father earned.

      (He marks Sokka&#x27;s head with dot and a half circle mark above it.)

      Bato: For Katara, the mark of the brave. Your courage inspires us.

      (He marks her head with a crescent shaped mark.)

      Bato: And for Aang, the mark of the trusted. You are now an honorary
      member of the water tribe.

      (He marks Aang&#x27;s forehead with a half circle mark.)

      Aang: I can&#x27;t.
      Katara: Of course you can!
      Aang (rubbing off the mark): No, you can&#x27;t trust me.

      (He backs away, his head hung low. Cut to a wider shot of the whole
group.)

      Katara: Aang, what are you talking about.
      Aang (holding out the crumpled scroll): A messenger gave this to me for
      Bato. (Katara looks at the scroll and draws in a breath of surprise.) You
      have to understand, I was afraid you&#x27;d �
      Sokka (looking at the map, and then Aang in hurt and surprise): This is
      the map to our father! You had it the whole time!? How could you? (Aang
      shrivels up.) Well, you can go to the North Pole on your own! I&#x27;m going to
      find Dad.

      (Cut to wide shot with Sokka stalking away angrily.)

      Bato: Now Sokka, I think you should �
      Sokka: Katara, are you with me?
      Katara (looking at Aang, then lowering her eyes): I&#x27;m with you, Sokka.

      (She turns away, then cut to the three water tribe members leaving Aang
      alone on the beach. Fade to commercial break.)

      Scene III

      (The show returns to another daytime long shot of the abbey. Cut to the
      three water tribe members putting backpacks on in the abbey&#x27;s main
      courtyard, Aang sitting on Appa in the background looking dejected. Katara
      walks sadly over to Aang.)

      Katara: Good luck.
      Aang: Okay. You too.

      (She walks out of the gate of the abbey, Bato and Sokka following. The
      Superior approaches Aang, who still sits on Appa.)

      Aang: Guess I should be moving on.
      Superior: That would be best.

      (He shakes Appa&#x27;s reigns, who walks them out of the gate. Cut to Aang
      sitting the driver&#x27;s seat looking to his left at the retreating figures of
      his friends in the distance. Momo clings to one of Appa&#x27;s horns.)

      Aang: I&#x27;m an idiot, Momo.

      (Fade to another overhead shot of the abbey, then cut to a group of
      sisters making perfume. The approach of the shirshu from o.c. can be
      heard. Cut to a shot of the gate, which bursts open, revealing the shirshu
      and its riders. Cut to the shirshu&#x27;s p.o.v., where Katara&#x27;s smell can be
      seen all over the courtyard.)

      June: We&#x27;re getting close.

      (June whips the shirshu again and it bounds out of the gate and up the
      road the Katara, Sokka and Bato used. Cut to the three walking through the
      walks along that same road. In the distance, a wolf can be heard. They
      stop to listen.)

      Katara: That wolf sounds so sad.
      Sokka: It&#x27;s probably wounded.
      Bato: No, it&#x27;s been separated from the pack. I understand that pain. It&#x27;s
      how I felt when the water tribe warriors had to leave me behind. They were
      my family and being apart from them was more painful than my wounds.

      (Close up of Sokka&#x27;s face. He is sad. A flashback begins of him on the
      South Pole once again, this time watching his father&#x27;s fleet depart into
      the mist. The flashback ends, revealing Sokka looking down at the ground,
      Katara and Bato behind him.)

      Katara: Sokka?
      Sokka (after a pause): We need to go back. I want to see Dad, but helping
      Aang is where we&#x27;re needed the most.
      Katara (smiling): You&#x27;re right.
      Bato (putting a hand on each of their shoulders): Your father will
      understand. And I know he&#x27;s proud of you.
      Sokka: Thanks, Bato.
      Bato: I know where to go from here. (He gives Sokka the map). Take this in
      case you want to find us. I&#x27;ll leave a message at the rendezvous point.

      (Pan up to the sky, then cut to Appa, Aang and Momo on the beach near
      Bato&#x27;s boat.)

      Aang: Looks like we&#x27;re going alone, guys.

      (The Superior rushes up to him.)

      Superior: Avatar! You must leave!
      Aang: Okay, I get it. Everybody wants me gone.
      Superior: A group of people came to the abbey looking for you.
      Aang (in alarm): Who?
      Superior: A fierce looking woman with a horrible monster and a young man
      with a scar.
      Aang: Zuko!
      Superior: The beast was using the scent of a necklace to follow you.
      Aang: A necklace? (Eyes suddenly going wide) Huh! Katara!

      (Cut to an overhead shot of the abbey in the distance. The screen pans
      down, following the road to were Sokka and Katara walk directly below. Cut
      to a frontal shot of the pair, where Sokka motions for his sister to stop
      as a galloping sound from o.c. is heard. The shirshu jumps into the frame
      behind them and they run, the monster and its riders in pursuit. Switch to
      the monster&#x27;s p.o.v., where it can see Katara&#x27;s scent all over the place.
      It focuses on her and it sees her completely colored the purple of her own
      scent. Cut back to a view of the shirshu and its riders.)

      June: So this is your girlfriend. (Zuko hops down and approaches her.) No
      wonder she left. She&#x27;s way too pretty for you.
      Zuko: Where is he? Where&#x27;s the Avatar?
      Sokka (defiantly): We split up! He&#x27;s long gone.
      Zuko: How stupid do you think I am?
      Sokka: Pretty stupid. (Grabbing Katara by the arm) Run!

      (They run, but the shirshu paralyzes them both with its tongue before they
      get very far.)

      Zuko: What are we supposed to do now?
      June: It&#x27;s seeking a different scent � perhaps something that the Avatar
      held.

      (The shirshu moves forward and starts sniffing the paralyzed pair. The map
      scroll falls out of Sokka&#x27;s backpack and rolls onto the ground. Cut to the
      shirshu&#x27;s p.o.v., where the scroll is covered in a blue scent. The trail
      leads back into the woods. Cut to the courtyard of the abbey and its
      hastily repaired gate. This is blown open again as the monster and its
      riders bust through again, sending sisters running away screaming in all
      directions. The shirshu begins walking around, sniffing.)

      Zuko: What&#x27;s it doing? It&#x27;s just going around in a circle!

      (Cut to the monster&#x27;s p.o.v. as it follows the blue scent around. Finally
      it looks up into the air to see the scent spiraling around. Suddenly Aang
      enters the frame on his glider. He flies up to the monster, which jumps up
      to snap at him. He misses, but does manage to dump his riders onto the
      floor of the courtyard. The shirshu also falls flat on his back.)

      Katara: Aang!

      (June gets up and whips the ground. The shirshu gets up and roars, June
      jumping onto its back. They charge after Aang. Cut to a camera angle from
      just behind Aang as the pair bear down on him. Right before impact, Appa
      enters the frame from the right and plows right into the shirshu, pushing
      him and his rider out the left side of the frame. They plow into the wall
      of building, knocking a whole through it. Cut to a close of Appa, a fiery
      grin on his face. He breathes heavily out his nostrils.

      Cut to Aang, whose smile turns to alarm as he turns away from Appa to face
      Zuko, whose hands are alight with fire as he advances on the Avatar. He
      fires a huge gout of flame at Aang, who blocks it by twirling his staff to
      break it up. They trade several rounds of blows, all of which miss or are
      blocked. Finally the two fire volleys simultaneously and both are blown
      backwards onto the roofs behind them.

      Cut to a zooming shot of June next to the shirshu, both unconscious. Iroh
      rushes up to the bounty hunter and pats the side of her face. She wakes
      up, rises to her feet. She cracks her whips and says something
      unintelligible. Then shirshu rises to its feet, she jumps in the saddle
      and they head back into battle. They charge Appa who is on the other side
      of the courtyard. Appa soars into the air as they reach him, but the
      shirshu lashes Appa&#x27;s tail with his tongue. Appa lands on the other side
      of the courtyard. He struggles to stay standing, but fails. He collapses
      in a cloud of dust. Cut to a close of Appa&#x27;s face, where his visible eye
      opens, then cut to a wider shot of him getting to his feet. The monsters
      charge each other after June whips the shirsu again, and they have a head
      on collision, throwing June over Appa&#x27;s head, whom she whips as she
      passes. She lands on the ground and rolls away just as Appa&#x27;s foot plants
      itself deep into the ground where she had just been.

      Cut to Aang who gets up groggily from where he&#x27;d fallen on the roof. His
      eyes go wide as the camera cuts to Zuko charging him down the spine of the
      roof. He throws a blast of the fire at the Avatar who flips over Zuko&#x27;s
      head to land behind him. They exchange blows with Aang eventually knocking
      Zuko off the roof. He is instantly replaced, however, when June and the
      shirshu jump onto the roof and pursue him. In the background, Appa turns
      down in the courtyard and uses his tail to create a gale that blows tiles
      off the roof as the shirshu passes.

      Shift to Katara and Sokka leaning up against the wall of the abbey. Sokka
      is wiggling his arm a bit.)

      Sokka: I&#x27;m starting to get some feeling back! (A bunch of tiles fall on
      them) Ow!

      (A few more melee shots of Aang being pursued is replaced by Iroh testing
      out perfumes nearby. He finds one he likes, looks from side to side to
      make sure no one is looking and then tucks the bottle into his robe, a
      mischievous smile on his face.

      Cut back to Aang and Zuko dueling once again, this time a covered well is
      between them. They trade volleys. Aang suddenly sees Katara&#x27;s necklace in
      Zuko&#x27;s hand.)

      Aang: You&#x27;ve got something I want!

      (They trade volleys again with Zuko soon destroying the well&#x27;s covering.
      They dance around on the lip of the well, neither one able to gain
      decisive advantage over the other. Aang keeps trying to grab the necklace,
      but fails. Then Zuko lunges after Aang and misses. As he passes, Aang uses
      puts his foot through the loop of the necklace, catching it. He then
      disappears down the well, with Zuko firing a huge gout of flame after him
      in frustration. Zuko is launched into the air as Aang reappears atop a
      huge jet of water and lands in the foreground. Rain from the huge jet of
      water begins to fall around him, quickly followed by Zuko hitting the
      ground.

      Zuko gets up and the duel begins anew, but this time Appa advances
      threateningly on Zuko. Before Appa can strike him, however, the shirshu
      lashes him three times in a row with his tongue. Appa tries to stay up,
      but can&#x27;t. He keels over, paralyzed.

      Cut to Sokka and Katara. The Superior puts some kind of perfume under
      their noses and they are then able to move better.)

      Sokka: That thing sees with its nose. Let&#x27;s give him something to look at.
      Superior: The perfume?

      (Sokka nods. Cut to pairs of sisters and Sokka moving huge white pots of
      perfume out into the courtyard. Cut to Aang dodging Zuko&#x27;s fire blasts and
      the shirshu&#x27;s tongue on the opposite wall. Cut back to the sisters who
      then they dump the perfume onto the ground. Katara waterbends the perfume
      into a huge sheet, moves it over the shirshu, and drops it. The monster
      shakes off the liquid, but a cut to its p.o.v. reveals that it s now
      terribly confused. Switch to a shot of Zuko getting tongue lashed by the
      monster, followed by June.)

      Iroh: June! Noooo!

      (Iroh catches the falling bounty hunter. Cut back to the rampaging
      shirshu. It breaks open a few more jars, paws the tiles of the roof of one
      of the buildings, then jumps over the wall and disappears. Cut to Aang
      picking up his staff, Katara and Sokka approaching him from behind. Switch
      to Zuko and Iroh laying flat on the ground. Iroh has June draped across
      his chest, his arm around her.)

      Zuko: Uncle? I didn&#x27;t see you get hit with the tongue.
      Iroh: Shh!

      (June&#x27;s eyes open, clearly displeased. Cut to Appa flying through the sky
      at sunset.)

      Aang: So, where do we go?
      Katara: We&#x27;re getting you to the North Pole.
      Sokka: Yeh, we&#x27;ve lost too much time as it is.
      Aang: Don&#x27;t you want to see your father?
      Sokka: Of course we do, Aang. But, you&#x27;re our family too, and right now,
      you need us more.
      Katara: And we need you.
      Aang: I wish I could give you a little piece of home, Katara. Something to
      remind you �
      Katara: I&#x27;ll be okay.
      Aang: Still, just a little trinket. Maybe something like�this!

      (Aang jumps up, proudly offering Katara her necklace, a huge smile on his
      face.)

      Katara (grabbing the necklace and putting it on happily): Aang, how did
      you get that?
      Aang (smiling): Zuko asked to be sure I got it to you.
      Katara (in mock appreciation): Oh, that&#x27;s so sweet of Zuko. Would you give
      him a kiss for me when you see him?
      Aang: Sure!

      (Katara kisses Aang&#x27;s cheek. He blushes and twiddles his thumbs. Cut to
      Appa flying off to the horizon, then fade to white.)

    第十五回
来自水部落的巴图

看哪，这剑是用鲸鱼牙做成的
让我看看
这是我们水宗的武器，帮我看看周围还能找到什么
丢东西了吗？
没，倒是找到了点东西
这箭被烧过了
这里曾发生过争斗，水宗的武士们伏击了火宗的部队
火宗人试图回击，但还是被水宗人赶下了山坡
-然后呢？
-我也不知道了
足迹到这儿就没有了
等等，看哪！
那是我们部落的船
-这是...老爸的船吗？
-不是，但应该是一个舰队的
老爸曾经来过这儿
啊~看吧，祖寇殿下，享受宁静之后心情也好多了吧？
退后！我在追一个偷渡者
我船上可没什么偷渡者
他被麻痹了
那只是暂时的，毒素一小时后就会退去
把他送进监狱，我就有钱收了
你是怎么知道他在我的船上的
我的麝鼠嗅觉极灵，找个人简直就是小菜一碟
真棒啊
真的很棒
（老色鬼~~）
-索卡
-我要跟你一起去
索卡，你还太小，还不能上战场
我很强壮，也很勇敢，老爸，
我很能打的，拜托让我去吧
身为男人，要知道自己的责任
现在你的任务就是好好的照顾你的妹妹
老爸，为什么不让我去啊
你总有一天会明白的
我会很想你的
是谁？
-索卡？
-巴图？
-又谁来了？
-巴图？
索卡！卡塔拉！
能见到你们俩真是太好了，看哪，都长得这么高了
-你好，在下是安昂
-老爸在哪？ -他在这儿吗？
他不在这儿，他和其他的勇士们正在土强国东部战斗
好冷，这儿可不是叙旧的地方，咱们进去谈
在我受伤后，你父亲把我送到了这个修道院来疗伤
（修道院？！）
从那以后，多亏了这里的嬷嬷们的照顾
院长，这两个就是 哈库达（Hakoda，暂译）
的孩子，他们正和降世神通一起旅行
我是在我们的船上发现他们的
神通，您的到来使敝院蓬荜生辉，
能见到您是我的荣幸
幸会！很荣幸能够拜访贵院，有什么事...
巴图，什么东西这么香？
是嬷嬷们精心研制的药膏和香水
香水？那应该往阿柏身上掸点
这家伙都臭死了，不是吗？
你还真的遗传了你父亲的风趣
巴图！这布置得就好像家里一样啊
哪里都一样，还有毛皮呢
是啊~有啥能比死动物的皮毛更令人舒服呢？
不是吧，你炖了 “海梅干”？
别客气啦，自己盛
老爸自己就能吃下整整一锅炖海梅干
巴图，听说你喝老爸曾经捕过北极河马，是真的吗？
那可是你父亲的主意，我是被他强拉去的
那你们骑它跑了吗？
嘿，我也骑过动物哩！想当年，那个大鳗鱼...
那你们俩谁碰到了 “巨肥长脖怪” 啊？
（the great blubber fiasco，不知何物）
-这个你们也知道？
-这事地球人都知道啊
-是啥典故啊，讲讲呗
-这个说来话长了，安昂，回头慢慢和你讲
你和老爸好像有很多好笑的冒险故事啊~
其实当时并没有觉得很好笑，
但事后每当想起这些
往事的时候都让人忍俊不禁啊
安昂，那可是庆典时用的，很容易坏的，快放下来
听说你们俩中有个人把章鱼放到自己头上，
愣说自己是“水灵”，居然忽悠得奶奶都相信了
戴章鱼的是你们老爸，我在后面出怪声，
那双簧演的老好了
别挡道，都给我闪一边去
他无意冒犯大家，你们都好干净啊，肯定常洗澡吧
我得跟你谈谈
哟，这不是我的新朋友吗，啥风把你们给吹到这儿来了
你的畜牲弄坏了我的船，你得赔我
这个，我倒是愿意赔你，不过我最近手头有点紧
今天晚上的酒我请了
钱我可以不要，反正我也不缺钱花
我需要你帮我找个人
找谁？女朋友跑了？
我不是要找女孩，我只要找跟她一起的那个小秃驴
真的？
如果你找到他们，船的事我就不追究了
嘁，不感兴趣
我们还付给你黄金的，你有多重就给你多少
要是给我的黄金和你一样重，那就成交
哈哈哈，一言为定
上来吧
有件事我差点忘记告诉你们了，
我正在等你父亲的一封信
-真的吗？
-啥时候到？
随时都有可能，你们的父亲说
他找到集结地后就会传个信回来
等到信一来，你们就可以和我一起去见你们的父亲了
都两年没见过老爸了，卡塔拉，这真是太出乎意料了
我真的很想他，真想赶快见到他
是啊，真的是好久没见了
还不知道那信啥时候能到，到的时候...
能见到老爸真的很棒，但是我们还不能去见他
我们得先带安昂去北极
即使我们等到了那封信，
谁知道我们要走多远才能见到老爸
我们的时间不多了
你的父亲一定会理解的...
你们能够帮助神通，他一定以你们为傲
他们居然要离开我了
我想找水宗的巴图
嗯，我知道巴图
确保把这封信交到他手上
用这张地图就能找到索卡和卡塔拉的父亲
大家好啊，抱歉我刚才离开了
安昂，我都没注意到你走开了
没事，我这不是回来了吗？
这个...让我来尝尝这美味的海梅干
快起开，刚有点风就被你们给挡没了
我们想找个人
希望不是想找我的“咪奇”
咪奇，你该不是又给人家火宗人捣乱了吧？
降世神通曾经路过这儿，咱们继续追
哈！逮到你了，你应该感到惭愧
怎么能随地乱扔纸屑呢？
对不起，我会把他处理掉的
我跟这船老有感情了，是我父亲亲手造的
他是用这艘船载你去“避冰”的吗？
没错，看这船上的划痕就知道了
索卡，你呢，你第一次“避冰”时
肯定有很多好玩的故事吧，说来听听
他还没去过呢，老爸走的时候他还太小
是啊，我都忘了
啥是“避冰”啊？
&quot;避冰&quot;是水族部落年轻成员的认证仪式
水族的年轻人年满岁时，他们的父亲就会带...
这样吧，不如咱们试一下吧
为什么停下来了
那个女孩肯定在这儿待了很长时间
没时间在这儿里磨蹭了
嘿，你要干嘛
看哪，它喜欢你
帅哥，不想来算算命吗？
我都这把年岁了，生活留给我的惊喜
已经不多了，我还是自己慢慢发掘吧
“避冰”这个仪式是对智慧、勇气和信任的考验
“避冰”，顾名思义，就是驾舟在满是冰川的海域中穿行
那现在这儿又没有冰，要避什么呢？
那就躲避这些...礁石吧
索卡，你来掌舵领航，用心做！
卡塔拉，你要确保主帆的安全，
风可能会很猛，要勇敢
安昂，三角帆归你了，如果你把不稳，我们都要玩完
这个位置是对信任的考验
我知道，我怎么会不知道呢？
我可是降世神通啊，怎么可能不知道信任
为了考验你们，我将不会插手帮忙
这艘船的命运就交给你们了
安昂，放松三角帆
卡塔拉，稳住
安昂，降帆
卡塔拉，配合他一下
安昂，护舵！护舵！
你到底是啥意思啊？
（本部分航海名词纯属瞎翻，见谅~）
干得好
前面没路了，咱们过不去
咱们一定能过去的
索卡，你已经证明了自己的实力了，也许咱们应该...
安昂，用你的御气术给帆鼓风
卡塔拉，尽可能用你的御水术控制船和礁石之间的水
现在就做！
以“水灵”之名授予你们这神圣的标志
索卡，授予你智慧之符，
你的父亲当年也是得到的智慧之符
卡塔拉，授予你勇气之符，你的勇气激励了我们
还有安昂，授予你信任之符，
你现在已经是水族部落的荣誉成员了
我不能接受
你受之无愧
我受之有愧
安昂，你再说什么啊
之前有个信使让我把这个交给巴图
希望你们能了解，我是害怕你们...
这是父亲的地图，你居然一直藏着？你怎么能这样？
你自己去北极吧，我要去找我的老爸去了
索卡，我想你应该...
卡塔拉，和我一起去吗？
索卡，我跟你走
-祝你好运
-你也是
-我想我也该走了
-那最好不过了
模模，我真是个白痴
快找到他们了
这狼叫得真凄凉啊
可能是受伤了
不是，应该是掉队了，离开了狼群
我了解这种痛苦
我现在孤身一人，远离水族的战友，就是这种感觉
他们是我的家人，离开他们的痛苦远胜于我的伤口疼痛
索卡？
我们得回去，我是想见老爸，可是帮安昂是当务之急
说得没错
你的父亲会理解你们的，他一定以你们为傲
谢谢你，巴图
我认得去那的路，地图你们就留下吧
到了集结点后会给你们发消息的
伙计们，看来咱们要自己上路了
神通，你得赶紧离开
好吧，知道了，怎么每个人都想让我走
有几个人来修道院来找你
-是谁？
-其中有个女的骑着怪兽，凶巴巴的；
还有个年轻男子，脸上有疤
祖寇！
那个畜牲是通过闻项链上的气味找到你们的
项链？坏了，卡塔拉
这就是你的女朋友啊，难怪她要离开你，
你一点都不配上她
他在哪？降世神通在哪？
我们分开走了，他早离开了
你认为我白痴啊？
是啊，相当白痴
快跑
现在该怎么做？
他在搜寻气味...可能神通拿过的东西还留在这儿
他在干嘛？怎么原地转圈啊
安昂！
我开始恢复知觉了
你有我要的东西
那个畜牲通过鼻子来认东西，我知道该怎么收拾他了
你是说用香水？
珍！
不要啊！
皇叔，我记得你没被那畜牲舌头舔中啊
嘘~
那么，咱们现在要去哪？
当然是带你去北极啦
都耽误很多时间了
你们不想去见老爸了吗？
当然想了，但是，安昂，你也是我们得家人
现在，你更需要我们
我们也需要你
我真希望能送你一件你老家的东西，
卡塔拉，可以让你想起...
不用费心了

水善国
土强国
火烈国
气和国
很久以前，这四大国和谐共处
然而，烈火国发起的战争结束了和平
只有同时掌握四种元素的降世神通才能结束战争

在拯救苍生之前，他要学的还有很多

安昂 能拯救这个世界
