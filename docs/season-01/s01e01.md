      The Boy In The Iceberg

      Written By: Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko
      Directed By: Dave Filoni
      Storyboard By: Giancarlo Volpe, Dave Filoni, Justin Ridge
      Animation By: JM Animation Co, Ltd
      Transcribers: Acastus and Pandora

      Introduction sequence - the introduction to this first episode is longer
      than the standard sequence that introduces the rest of the Avatar
      episodes. It contains more background than the standard sequence. The
      animation contains some additions to accommodate the longer narrative. The
      trip through the map to the Fire Nation amphibious assault is longer, the
      shot of the Avatar silhouetted by the sun is longer, and the third
      paragraph below is accompanied by a pan right shot over a still frame that
      shows a burning landscape ravaged by war. Also, the narration around the
      departure of her father is voiced over shots of the Water Tribe ships
      departing, and of a younger Katara and Sokka watching them leave. Lastly,
      the stone pinnacle on which Aang stands in future episodes is empty.

      Katara (voice over): Water... Earth... Fire... Air...

      My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days, a time of peace
      when the Avatar kept balance between the Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom, Fire
      Nation, and Air Nomads. But that all changed when the Fire Nation
      attacked.

      Only the Avatar mastered all four elements. Only he could stop the
      ruthless firebenders. But when the world needed him most, he vanished.

      A hundred years have passed and the Fire Nation is nearing victory in the
      war. Two years ago, my father and the men of my tribe journeyed to the
      Earth Kingdom to help fight against the Fire Nation, leaving me and my
      brother to look after our tribe.

      Some people believe that the Avatar was never reborn into the Air Nomads
      and that the cycle is broken, but I haven&#x27;t lost hope. I still believe
      that somehow the Avatar will return to save the world.

      Act I

      (The show opens with an overhead shot of iceberg laden waters. The screen
      pans left and rotates showing footprints in the snow, then fades to
      soaring pan shot from the air of the icy waters. As if the shot were taken
      from the outside of an airplane, the camera banks left as it moves
      forward. It comes to rest and slowly zooms in on a two person canoe out
      among the icebergs. Cut to a closer shot of the canoe. A teenage boy,
      Sokka, shaven headed except for a pony tail, stands in the canoe. He looks
      down at the water, spear at the ready. The other occupant is a young girl.
      Both wear blue overcoats. The canoe drifts slowly as the boy concentrates
      on fishing. Cut to a close, overhead shot of the canoe. Beside the boat a
      fish swims close to the surface in front of the boy.)

      Sokka: It&#x27;s not getting away from me this time. Watch and learn, Katara.
      This is how you catch a fish.

      (Katara leans over the edge of the canoe to see a fish. Hesitantly, she
      removes her left glove. She takes a deep breather and with a look of
      trepidation begins to motion with her exposed hand. Suddenly, a globe of
      water containing the fish bursts out of the water.)

      Katara: Sokka, look!
      Sokka: (whispers) Shhh. Katara, you&#x27;re gonna scare it away. Mmmm... I can
      already smell it cookin&#x27;!
      Katara (trying to retain control of the globe of water): But Sokka! I
      caught one!

      (She struggles with the blob of water and it floats closer to Sokka, who
      raises his spear to strike a fish. When he cocks his arm back he burst the
      bubble of water. The fish falls back into the sea and Sokka gets
      drenched.)

      Katara: Hey!
      Sokka (very exasperated): Ugh! Why is it that every time you play with
      magic water I get soaked?
      Katara: It&#x27;s not magic. It&#x27;s waterbending, and it&#x27;s�
      Sokka: Yeah, yeah, an ancient art unique to our culture, blah blah blah.
      Look, I&#x27;m just saying that if I had weird powers, I&#x27;d keep my weirdness to
      myself.
      Katara: You&#x27;re calling me weird? I&#x27;m not the one who makes muscles at
      myself every time I see my reflection in the water.

      (Cut to Sokka, who is making a muscle and looking at his reflection in the
      water. He turns to Katara and gives her a look. Suddenly the boat is
      bumped, they look up to see they have entered an ice packed area. The
      begin to work frantically to maneuver the canoe between the icebergs.)

      Katara and Sokka: Ahhh!
      Katara: Watch out! Go left! Go left!

      (Cut to an overhead shot of the canoe as it threads its way through the
      ice pack. Icebergs are colliding all around them. Each time they manage to
      avoid getting crushed between the colliding icebergs, but their safety
      margins decreases rapidly each time. Finally the canoe is crushed when
      three icebergs collide at once. Sokka and Katara jump out in time onto one
      of the icebergs. Cut to a wide shot of the ice field. They are now at the
      mercy of the currents. Then cut back to the kids.)

      Katara: You call that left?
      Sokka: You don&#x27;t like my steering. Well, maybe you should have waterbended
      us out of the ice.

      (Cut to a wide shot of the kids on their little iceberg. Behind them a
      huge towering iceberg rears up into the sky.)

      Katara: So it&#x27;s my fault?
      Sokka: I knew I should have left you home. Leave it to a girl to screw
      things up.

      (Cut to a close of up Katara, her anger boiling over. She points at her
      brother.)

      Katara: You are the most sexist, immature, nut brained...

      (As she gets more excited, the iceberg on which they are sitting begins to
      heave. Switch to a wider shot, where the huge iceberg behind her cracks.)

      Katara: ugh, I&#x27;m embarrassed to be related to you! Ever since Mom died
      I&#x27;ve been doing all the work around camp while you&#x27;ve been off playing
      soldier!
      Sokka (noticing the cracking iceberg): Uh... Katara?
      Katara: I even wash all the clothes! Have you ever smelled your dirty
      socks? Let me tell you, NOT PLEASANT!
      Sokka: Katara! Settle down!
      Katara: No, that&#x27;s it. I&#x27;m done helping you. From now on, you&#x27;re on your
      own!

      (By the end she is screaming. As she finishes, the iceberg behind her
      splits open entirely. It disintegrates and the major pieces fall into the
      water, pushing their iceberg away. They hold on desperately until the
      iceberg settles.)

      Sokka: Okay, you&#x27;ve gone from weird to freakish, Katara.
      Katara: You mean I did that?
      Sokka: Yup. Congratulations.

      (They both are leaning over the edge of the iceberg raft. Suddenly, the
      water just in front of them begins to glow an incandescent blue. They move
      backwards on their raft as another, lighter colored iceberg breaks the
      surface. It is unclear whether this is part of the one Katara broke up or
      not. As the new iceberg settles, Katara walks to edge of their iceberg
      raft to get a better look. Deep in the ice, the figure of a boy in a
      meditation pose is seen. He has white arrows on his fists and on his bald
      head. Suddenly, his eyes glow and his arrow markings glow white.)

      Katara: He&#x27;s alive! We have to help.

      (She grabs Sokka&#x27;s hockey stick type spear, pulls down her hood and turns
      to go to the boy.)

      Sokka: Katara! Get back here! We don&#x27;t know what that thing is!

      (Katara ignores him and skips across a few little icebergs to arrive at
      the one in which the boy is trapped. Sokka follows. She begins to use the
      hockey stick to whack the ice. After a few big whacks, she cracks open the
      ice. It looks like air is released, as if the iceberg had a hollow chamber
      within it, but it is not entirely clear. The iceberg then cracks from top
      to bottom and explodes open. A huge shaft of white blue light shoots
      straight into the heavens. Cut to a quick shot of the iceberg from
      underwater where it glows brightly, then to shot an above ground shot from
      somewhere nearby where the shaft of light and the aurora australis is
      clearly seen in the background. The foreground is occupied by a herd of
      tiger seals, who rears themselves up and roar at the phenomenon.

      Cut to a view of an iron hulled battleship with a spiked prow cutting
      through the sea also nearby. It is apparently steam powered as it has a
      single smokestack. The foredeck is much longer than the afterdeck. The
      bridge appears to be several decks above the main deck. Cut to a shot of
      the back of a young man on the foredeck dressed in red, also shaven-headed
      except for a pony-tail, staring intently at the shaft of light in front of
      the ship. Then cut to a shot of his face, still illuminated by the shaft
      of light. The left side of his face is badly scarred around his left eye.
      The is Prince Zuko. The light from the light shaft dissipates.)

      Zuko: Finally. (He turns to address someone o.c.) Uncle, do you realize
      what this means?

      (Cut to an old man seated cross legged at a low table, drinking tea and
      playing a game involving domino like objects.)

      Iroh: I won&#x27;t get to finish my game?
      Zuko: It means my search - it&#x27;s about to come to an end.

      (Iroh groans.)

      Zuko: That light came from an incredibly powerful source. It has to be
      him!
      Iroh: Or it&#x27;s just the celestial lights. We&#x27;ve been down this road before,
      Prince Zuko. I don&#x27;t want you to get too excited over nothing. Please,
      sit. Why don&#x27;t you enjoy a cup of calming jasmine tea?
      Zuko (exploding in anger): I don&#x27;t need any calming tea! I need to capture
      the Avatar. Helmsman, head a course for the light!

      (Cut back to a wide shot of the exploded iceberg, which quickly shifts to
      Sokka still shielding his sister from the blast that just dissipated. They
      look up to see residual blue light still swirling around the top of what
      is left of the iceberg. Suddenly, the boy appears, his eyes and arrow
      markings still aglow.)

      Sokka (raising his spear at the boy): Stop!

      (The boy stands up as the glow and residual energy fades. He seems to pass
      out and slides down the side of the ruined iceberg to Sokka and Katara,
      who lunges forward and catches him as he falls. Sokka pokes Aang in the
      head with the blunt end of his weapon.)

      Katara: Stop it!

      (She gives Sokka the heisman and turns to the boy. She gently turns him
      over so that he is lying on his back. He begins to wake up. He slowly
      opens his eyes and the camera switches to the boy&#x27;s p.o.v. to show his
      view of Katara. A breeze gently blows her braids and we hear him intake a
      breath.)

      Aang (whispering in a weak voice): I need to ask you something.
      Katara: What?
      Aang (still whispering): Please... come closer.
      Katara: What is it?
      Aang (in a normal, even excited voice): Will you go penguin sledding with
      me?
      Katara: Uh... sure. I guess.

      (Aang airbends himself to his feet as he starts to rub the back of his
      head.)

      Sokka: Ahh!
      Aang: What&#x27;s going on here?
      Sokka: You tell us! How&#x27;d you get in the ice? (Poking Aang with his spear)
      And why aren&#x27;t you frozen?
      Aang (batting the spear anway, absently): I&#x27;m not sure.

      (Aang gasps as a low, animal like noise is heard from o.c. and begins to
      frantically climb back up the ruined iceberg. He jumps over the lip of
      what is in fact now a crater and lands on a huge furry animal.)

      Aang: Appa! Are you all right? Wake up, buddy.

      (He leans down and opens one of the beasts eyes. He closes it again. Aang
      hops down and tries to lift the animal&#x27;s huge head, but without effect.
      Katara and Sokka come around the corner and their mouths drop in shock as
      the see the monster, whose mouth opens and licks the boy trying to wake
      him up.)

      Aang: Haha! You&#x27;re okay!

      (He hugs Appa, then cut to a wide shot of the destroyed iceberg. Appa
      occupies most of the crater left by the explosion. He is a huge flying
      bison with six legs and horns like a steer. He gets up and shakes himself
      off a bit.)

      Sokka: What is that thing?
      Aang: This is Appa, my flying bison.
      Sokka: Right. And this is Katara, my flying sister.

      (Aang is about to reply, but doesn&#x27;t as Appa begins to sneeze. Aang ducks
      in time as Appa proceeds to sneeze all over Sokka.)

      Sokka: Ewww! Aahh!!!

      (Sokka, covered in snot, tries to get rid of it by rolling around on the
      ice and snow.)

      Aang: Don&#x27;t worry. It&#x27;ll wash out.
      Sokka: Ugh!
      Aang: So, do you guys live around here?
      Sokka: Don&#x27;t answer that! Did you see that crazy bolt of light? He was
      probably trying to signal the Fire Navy.
      Katara: Oh, yeah, I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s a spy for the Fire Navy. You can tell by
      that evil look in his eye.

      (Cut to a shot of Aang&#x27;s innocent face, his smile accompanied by a funny
      sound effect.)

      Katara: The paranoid one is my brother, Sokka. You never told us your
      name.
      Aang: I&#x27;m A... aaaahhhh... ahhhhhh.... aaah aaah aaah AAAAAAACHOOOO!

      (As Aang sneezes he zooms of the ground far into the air. He responds to
      her question after he lands to the whistling sound of a bomb dropping.)

      Aang: I&#x27;m Aang.

      (He sniffles and rubs his nose.)

      Sokka: (incredulous) You just sneezed... and flew ten feet in the air.
      Aang: Really? It felt higher that that.
      Katara (gasping): You&#x27;re an airbender!
      Aang: Sure am.
      Sokka: Giant light beams... flying bison... airbenders... I think I&#x27;ve got
      Midnight Sun Madness. I&#x27;m going home to where stuff makes sense.

      (Sokka turns to walk off, but is stopped at the iceberg&#x27;s edge. The camera
      zooms way out to show how desolate the area is. Just sea and ice.)

      Aang: Well, if you guys are stuck Appa and I can give you a lift.

      (Aang airbends himself onto Appa&#x27;s head, then to the top of his back where
      rests an enormous saddle. Reigns are attached to both of Appa&#x27;s great
      horns.)

      Katara: We&#x27;d love a ride! Thanks! (She gets on Appa.)
      Sokka: Oh, no... I am not getting on that fluffy snot monster.
      Katara: Are you hoping some other kind of monster will come along and give
      you a ride home? You know... before you freeze to death?

      (Sokka starts to say something and gives up before he does. He sighs. Cut
      to Katara and Sokka in the back part of the saddle. Katara looks excited.
      Sokka looks grumpy, arms folded across his chest.)

      Aang: Okay. First time flyers, hold on tight! Appa, yip yip!

      (Aang shakes the reigns and Appa makes a low rumble. Cut to a rear shot of
      Appa. He flaps his huge beaver tail and then launches into the air. He
      spreads his legs wide, but then comes right back down into the water with
      a huge splash. He begins to swim them forward.)

      Aang (shaking the reigns again): Come on, Appa. Yip yip.
      Sokka: Wow. That was truly amazing.
      Aang: Appa&#x27;s just tired. A little rest and he&#x27;ll be soaring through the
      sky. You&#x27;ll see.

      (He makes a �soaring through the sky� motion with his hand, his eyes
      finally resting on Katara. He leaves them there, a smile on his face as he
      looks at her.)

      Katara: Why are you smiling at me like that?
      Aang: Oh... I was smiling?
      Sokka (disgusted): Uuuuugh.

      (Cut to a shot of Appa swimming through the water, flopping his tale. Fade
      back to Prince Zuko&#x27;s Fire Navy ship. Zuko, on the spotting deck off the
      bridge looking forward, is approached by Iroh. It is now night.)

      Iroh: I&#x27;m going to bed now. (He makes an exaggerated yawn) Yep. A man
      needs his rest. Prince Zuko, you need some sleep. Even if you&#x27;re right and
      the Avatar is alive, you won&#x27;t find him. Your father, grandfather, and
      great-grandfather all tried and failed.
      Zuko: Because their honor didn&#x27;t hinge on the Avatar&#x27;s capture. Mine does.
      This coward&#x27;s hundred years in hiding are over.

      (Fade back to a long shot of Appa swimming, his friends on his back. Cut
      to a closer, overhead shot. Aang lies back on top of Appa&#x27;s head. Katara,
      in the saddle on Appa&#x27;s back with her brother, crawls forward and looks
      down from the saddle at Aang.)

      Katara: Hey.
      Aang: Hey. Whatcha thinkin&#x27; about?
      Katara: I guess I was wondering � your being an airbender and all � if you
      had any idea what happened to the Avatar.
      Aang (looking disconcerted): Uhh... no. I didn&#x27;t know him... I mean, I
      knew people that knew him, but I didn&#x27;t. Sorry.
      Katara: Okay. Just curious. Goodnight.
      Aang: Sleep tight.

      (Katara turns away and the camera zooms up to Aang, who also looks away,
      an expression of fear on his face. Cut to a long shot of Appa swimming
      again before a cut to commercial break.)

      Act II

      (The show returns to Aang in a dream. The colors are grays, cr�mes and
      pale browns. He wakes up on top of Appa and the view rotates with Aang in
      Appa&#x27;s saddle, then cut to Aang struggling against Appa&#x27;s reigns with
      heavy rain coming down.)

      Aang: Aaahhh!

      (Cut to an underwater shot, where Aang and Appa suddenly penetrate the
      surface and enter the watery depths. They come up briefly for air, Appa
      groans, but they are once again driven under the storm tossed waves. As
      they drift downward, Aang drops Appa&#x27;s reigns and begins to lose
      consciousness. Suddenly, Aang&#x27;s eyes and markings glow white. He puts his
      hands together and he freezes himself and Appa in a huge ball of ice.)

      Katara (voice over): Aang! Aang, wake up! (He wakes up, gasping) It&#x27;s
      okay. We&#x27;re in the village now. Come on, get ready. Everyone&#x27;s waiting to
      meet you.

      (Aang gets up and puts on his shirt and hood. Katara looks at his
      airbender tattoos. She grabs Aang by the hand and drags him outside. He
      carries a staff with him.)

      Aang: Whaaaa!

      (Cut to a wide overhead shot as Katara pulls him out. A small crowd has
      gathered to greet him. It is composed of women of various ages and
      children.)

      Katara: Aang, this is the entire village. Entire village, Aang.

      (Aang bows to them in a friendly manner, but the people pull back from him
      anyway.)

      Aang: Uh... why are they all looking at me like that? Did Appa sneeze on
      me?

      (An old woman enters the frame as Aang inspects his clothes for bison
      snot.)

      Gran Gran: Well, no one has seen an airbender in a hundred years. We
      thought they were extinct until my granddaughter and grandson found you.
      Aang: �Extinct&#x27;?
      Katara: Aang, this is my grandmother.
      Gran Gran: Call me Gran Gran.
      Sokka (grabbing Aang&#x27;s staff): What is this, a weapon? You can&#x27;t stab
      anything with this.
      Aang: It&#x27;s not for stabbing. (He creates a jet of air that sucks the staff
      back into his hand.) It&#x27;s for airbending.

      (Aang opens the staff into a glider with red wings.)

      Little Girl: Magic trick! Do it again!
      Aang: Not magic, airbending. It lets me control the air currents around my
      glider and fly.
      Sokka: You know, last time I checked, humans can&#x27;t fly.
      Aang: Check again!

      (Aang launches himself into the air with his glider. He soars through the
      air, doing loops as the villagers on the ground point to him in wonder.)

      Villagers: Whoa... it&#x27;s flying... it&#x27;s amazing!

      (Aang looks down at Katara who smiles at him. He is so enthralled with her
      attention that slams right into Sokka&#x27;s guard tower. He pulls his head out
      of the tower and falls to the ground with his glider.)

      Aang (as he crashes): Oof!
      Sokka (gasping): My watchtower!
      Katara: That was amazing.

      (She helps Aang back to his feet. He twirls his glider shut as Sokka
      examines the damaged tower behind him. After Aang closes the glider a huge
      bank of snow buries Sokka.)

      Sokka: Great. You&#x27;re an airbender, Katara&#x27;s a waterbender, together you
      can just waste time all day long.
      Aang: You&#x27;re a waterbender!
      Katara: Well... sort of. Not yet.
      Gran Gran: All right. No more playing. Come on, Katara, you have chores.

      (Gran Gran leads Katara away.)

      Katara: I told you! He&#x27;s the real thing, Gran Gran! I finally found a
      bender to teach me.
      Gran Gran: Katara, try not to put all your hopes in this boy.
      Katara: But he&#x27;s special. I can tell. I sense he&#x27;s filled with much
      wisdom.

      (She looks over to her right. Cut to Aang with his tongue frozen to his
      staff, children gathered around him.)

      Aang: (slurring) Sthee? Now my tongue ith thuck to my sthaff.

      (A child next to him grabs the staff and yanks, but Aang&#x27;s tongue stays
      stuck.)

      Children (clapping): Tee hee!

      (Fade to an afternoon or sunset shot of Zuko&#x27;s ship cutting through the
      waves, then cut to Zuko facing two Fire Navy seamen. Iroh sits nearby.)

      Iroh: Again.

      (Zuko blasts fire from his hands at the guards, but misses. Then the
      guards attack Zuko with blasts of fire from their fists, but Zuko dodges.
      He back flips over the guards to land behind them.)

      Zuko: Ha! Heeya!

      (Iroh sighs and gets up.)

      Iroh: No! Power in firebending comes from the breath. Not the muscles. The
      breath becomes energy in the body. The energy extends past your limbs and
      becomes fire. (Iroh demonstrates, releasing a controlling plume of flame
      that bursts in front of Zuko, but does not hit him) Get it right this
      time.
      Zuko: Enough. I&#x27;ve been drilling this sequence all day. Teach me the next
      set. I&#x27;m more than ready.
      Iroh: No, you are impatient. You have yet to master your basics. (More
      forcefully) Drill it again!
      Zuko: Grrrr... huh! (He blasts one of the guards backwards with a gout of
      fire.) The sages tell us that the Avatar is the last airbender. He must be
      over a hundred years old by now. He&#x27;s had a century to master the four
      elements. I&#x27;ll need more than basic firebending to defeat him. You WILL
      teach me the advanced set!
      Iroh: Very well. But first I must finish my roast duck. (Begins eating)
      Num num... num...

      (Cut to a shot of the afternoon sky. The screen pans down to reveal Sokka,
      clearly addressing an audience as he paces back and forth.)

      Sokka: Now men, it&#x27;s important that you show no fear when you face a
      firebender. In the Water Tribe, we fight to the last man standing. For
      without courage, how can we call ourselves men?

      (Cut to the audience. It is a group of six children, most of whom are
      toddlers.)

      Little Boy (raising his hand): I gotta pee!
      Sokka: Listen! Until your fathers return from the war, they&#x27;re counting on
      you to be the men of this tribe. And that means no potty breaks.
      Little Boy: But I really gotta go.
      Sokka (sighing): Okay... who else has to go?

      (All six raise their hands. Sokka slaps his forehead in disgust as all six
      exit to the right. Katara enters from the left.)

      Katara: Have you seen Aang? Gran Gran said he disappeared over an hour
      ago.

      (Cut to Aang emerging from a small igloo type bathroom stall. He adjusts
      his pants and smiles at the trip of boys coming to use the toilet.)

      Aang (gesturing over his shoulder at the toilet): Wow! Everything freezes
      in there!
      Children: Hahaha!
      Sokka: Ugh! Katara, get him out of here. This lesson is for warriors only.

      Kid (voice over): Wheeee!

      (Cut to a rear shot of Appa, Aang on his back. They have propped up his
      tail using a makeshift sawhorse. A kid has used Appa&#x27;s back and tail as a
      slide to land in a pile of snow. The children, and soon Katara, all start
      laughing.)

      Sokka: Stop! Stop it right now! (To Aang) What&#x27;s wrong with you? We don&#x27;t
      have time for fun and games with a war going on.
      Aang: What war? (He hops down off of Appa) What are you talking about?
      Sokka: You&#x27;re kidding, right?

      (Aang&#x27;s gaze shifts slightly off of Sokka to look at something beyond him
      o.c.)

      Aang: PENGUIN!

      (To accentuate Aang&#x27;s exclamation the screen around him vibrates slightly
      in a visual effect. Cut to a shot of a penguin in distance, visible
      between Sokka and Katara. The camera closes on the penguin almost
      instantly. The penguin, aware that it has been spotted, makes an excited
      noise and turns to waddle away. Aang uses his airbending skill to run at
      unbelievable speed toward the horizon where the penguin had just been.)

      Sokka: He&#x27;s kidding, right?

      (Cut to commercial break.)

      Act III

      (Fade to a beach loaded with penguins who waddle around squawking. Katara
      enters, looking for Aang.)

      Katara: Aang?

      (Cut to Aang chasing some penguins, but unable to catch them as the waddle
      away.)

      Aang: Haha! Hey, come on little guy. Wanna go sledding?

      (Aang lunges, but falls flat on his face. He gets back up as Katara
      approaches.)

      Aang: Oof! Heh heh, I have a way with animals. (He puts his arms out and
      waddles in imitation of the four flippered penguins) Yarp! Yarp yarp!
      Yarp! Yarp yarp! Yarp!
      Katara: (giggles) Hahaha... Aang, I&#x27;ll help you catch a penguin if you
      teach me waterbending.
      Aang: You got a deal! Just one little problem. I&#x27;m an airbender, not a
      waterbender. Isn&#x27;t there someone in your tribe who can teach you?
      Katara (looking away in sadness): No. You&#x27;re looking at the only
      waterbender on the whole South Pole.
      Aang: This isn&#x27;t right. A waterbender needs to master water. What about
      the North Pole? There&#x27;s another Water Tribe up there, right? Maybe they
      have waterbenders who could teach you.
      Katara: Maybe. But we haven&#x27;t had contact with our sister tribe in a long
      time. It&#x27;s not exactly �turn right at the second glacier.&#x27; It&#x27;s on the
      other side of the world.
      Aang: But you forget: I have a flying bison. Appa and I can personally fly
      you to the North Pole. Katara, we&#x27;re gonna find you a master!
      Katara (happily): That&#x27;s... (then uncertain) I mean, I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ve
      never left home before.
      Aang: Well, you think about it. But in the meantime, can you teach me to
      catch one of these penguins?
      Katara (mock teacherly tone): Okay, listen closely my young pupil.
      Catching penguins is an ancient and sacred art. Observe.

      (She produces a little fish from her coat and tosses it at Aang. He is
      instantly surrounded by a horde of hungry penguins.

      Fade to a shot of an ice bank. It appears to be late afternoon. Suddenly,
      Katara and Aang rocket off the ice bank, each sitting atop a penguin. The
      land on the bank below and continue down at high speed on the penguin&#x27;s
      belly. Aang and his penguin take a jump off a small ramp, eventually
      landing in front of Katara. She takes the jump and lands near him. They
      laugh and whoop happily.)

      Katara: I haven&#x27;t done this since I was a kid!
      Aang: You still are a kid!

      (They continue to rocket across the frozen landscape, eventually entering
      system of ice tunnels. The tunnels are have periodic gaps where sunlight
      pours through. They emerge from the tunnels and get off their mounts,
      which stand up and dizzily wander away making little chirping noises. They
      walk forward, looking at something in front of them.)

      Aang: Whoa... what is that?

      (Cut to a huge ship locked in the ice in front of them. It is a derelict
      Fire Navy ship, silhouetted by the sun behind it.)

      Katara (deathly serious): A Fire Navy ship, and a very bad memory for my
      people.

      (Aang begins to walk to the ship.)

      Katara: Aang, stop! We&#x27;re not allowed to go near it. The ship could be
      booby trapped.
      Aang: If you wanna be a bender, you have to let go of fear.

      (She looks uncertain, then follows him to the ship. They climb up and
      enter the ship through a gaping hole in one of forward compartments below
      the water line. They walk around the dark corridors inside past many a
      darkened room.)

      Katara: This ship has haunted my tribe since Gran Gran was a little girl.
      It was part of the Fire Nation&#x27;s first attacks.
      Aang: Okay, back up. I have friends all over the world, even in the Fire
      Nation. I&#x27;ve never seen any war.
      Katara: Aang, how long were you in that iceberg?
      Aang: I don&#x27;t know... a few days, maybe?
      Katara: I think it was more like a hundred years!
      Aang: What? That&#x27;s impossible. Do I look like a hundred-twelve year old
      man to you?
      Katara: Think about it. The war is a century old. You don&#x27;t know about it
      because, somehow, you were in there that whole time. It&#x27;s the only
      explanation.

      (Aang puts his hand to his head and walks backward. Stunned by this
      realization, he sinks to the floor.)

      Aang: A hundred years! I can&#x27;t believe it.
      Katara (kneeling next to him): I&#x27;m sorry, Aang. Maybe somehow there&#x27;s a
      bright side to all this.
      Aang: I did get to meet you.
      Katara (smiles): Come on. Let&#x27;s get out of here.

      (She helps him back to his feet and they start walking once again. Fade to
      an exterior shot of the Fire Navy ship. Cut back to an interior shot of
      the ship as Aang enters a darkened room on the ship, Katara behind in the
      hallway.)

      Katara: Aang? Let&#x27;s head back. This place is creepy.
      Aang: Huh?

      (Cut to a shot of Aang&#x27;s foot dragging a trip wire on the floor. Behind
      them the door is blocked by a grate that drops from the ceiling. They grab
      it just after it falls shut. They are trapped.)

      Aang: What&#x27;s that you said about booby traps?

      (Around them, machinery in the room starts to operate. Gauges how steam
      pressure and wheels begin to turn. Steam begins to pour out of some of the
      equipment. Cut to an exterior shot of the ship. Suddenly, a bright flare
      explodes out of the Fire Navy ship and into the sky, leaving a trail of
      smoke behind it. Cut back to Aang and Katara looking out the window of the
      ship&#x27;s bridge.)

      Aang: Uh oh.

      (Cut back to the flare as it rises. When it reaches its zenith it explodes
      with a small shower of sparks. Cut back to Aang and Katara with a wide
      shot on the bridge. There is a hole in the ceiling that Aang is looking
      at.)

      Aang: Hold on tight!

      (He grabs Katara, who cries out in surprise, and launches them both
      through the hole in the ceiling. He lands with her in his arms on top of
      the bridge.

      Cut to a long shot of the falling flare as soon through the lens of a
      telescope. The telescope follows the flare down for a few moments, before
      shifting downwards to show Aang hopping down the ship and the ice which
      encases it to the ground below, Katara still in his arms.)

      Zuko (voice over): The last airbender. (Cut to a profile view of Zuko
      looking through his telescope) Quite agile for his old age. Wake my uncle!
      Tell him I found the Avatar...

      (Zuko looks back into his telescope to see Aang and Katara running across
      the ice away from the ship. He then scans left quickly, then pulls it back
      right to focus on Katara&#x27;s village.)

      Zuko: ...as well as his hiding place.

      (Cut to a close up of Zuko&#x27;s left eye, the unscarred one, which arches in
      determination.)

    水善国
土强国
火烈国
气和国
我的祖母经常给我讲以前的故事
群雄四分的时候
在降世神通掌控下，四国相安无事，天下太平
但在烈火国发动战争之后，一切都改变了
只有掌握四种元素的降世神通
才能扼制这场火宗挑起的战争
但当世界最需要他的时候，他却消失了
年后，火族似乎就要赢得战争的胜利
年前，我的父亲和我族的武士
去帮助土族抵抗火族的进攻
由我和哥哥来照看整个部落
人们传言，降世神通不会在气宗重生了
他已魂飞魄散了
但我仍抱有希望
我仍然相信，他会回来拯救这个世界

-=降世神通=-
最后的气宗

第一卷
  水
第一章
冰川中的男孩
这回你可跑不了了。
卡塔拉, 看着学着点，这才叫抓鱼。
看哪，索卡
嘘~，卡塔拉， 小声点，你该把鱼吓跑了。
嗯，我都能闻到鱼香味了。
索卡，我抓到一条了。
- 嘿！
-啊
为什么你每次用法术玩水时，遭殃的都是我
这不是魔法，这叫御水术
-这是...
-是啊，是啊
是个古老的艺术，是我们独一无二的文化，嘁~
如果我有这种怪异的能力，我可不会告诉别人
你说我怪异
每次看水中倒影时都秀肌肉才叫怪异哩
啊~
小心！
往左划，往左划
你那叫往左划啊？
你不喜欢我掌舵，好啊
那就用你的“御水术”带我们离开这儿吧
- 那是我的错了？
-我就知道不该带你出来。
有女孩在身边只会碍事
你这个大菜鸟，没脑子。我怎么有你这么个哥哥呢？
老妈死后，是我操持全家的家务，
而你只会玩战争游戏
-卡塔拉~
-衣服也全是我洗得！
你都没闻过你那臭袜子
臭不可闻！！
- 卡塔拉，冷静点。
-以后甭想我再帮你干活。
从今以后，再没人帮你了！
-卡塔拉，你的怪异这么快就有新版本了
-刚才不是我做的吧？
不是你还是我？
他还活着，我们得帮帮他。
卡塔拉，快回了，我们都不知道那是啥玩艺？
终于让我发现了，皇叔，你知道这意味着什么吗？
- 我玩不完我的游戏了？
-这意味着我们的搜索终于可以告一段落了
刚才那道光分明是来自一个巨强的力源，那肯定就是降世神通。
祖寇殿下，这条路咱们以前来过，那种光咱们也看见过。
希望越大，失望也就越大。
过来坐坐歇歇吧，喝点茉莉花茶平静平静
我才不需要喝什么花茶，我需要的是抓住降世神通
舵手，向着光行进
站住别动
你在干嘛
-我想求你点事
-啥事？
- 靠近点呗
-到底啥事？
能和我一起玩企鹅滑行吗？
嗯，我想没问题。
- 到底发生了什么？
-还想问你呢
你咋进到冰山里去的，竟然还没冻僵
我也不知道
阿柏!
你还好吗？伙计，快醒醒
嘿，你没事太好了
- 这是什么东西？
-它叫阿柏，我的飞天大野牛。
那我也要介绍一下，这是我的飞天老妹，卡塔拉
别担心，能洗掉的
- 嗯，你们是住在附近吗？
-别答礼他。
你没看到那个光球吗，他肯定是想通风报信
是啊，他肯定是火宗的间隙，你看看他那“邪恶”的小眼睛~
-这是我讨厌的哥哥，索卡。还不知道你叫啥呢？
-我...
我叫 安昂
- 你打了个喷嚏就飞起来英尺。
-是吗，应该不止英尺吧。
你是御气师吧。
- 敝人正是。
-飞过的光球，飞天野牛，御气师，什么跟什么啊。我肯定是在做梦
我得回去洗洗，清醒清醒。
你们被困住了，上来，我带你们一程。
那就多谢了。
噢，不，我可不想爬上那个浑身是毛的鼻涕兽身上
你可别指望有什么其它的怪兽来载你回家
在你冻死前应该是没啥希望的
-那个....
好吧，这是你们第一次飞行 吧，抓紧了
起飞了，驾，驾
阿柏，加油啊，驾，驾
喔，这还真是“惊人”啊
阿柏只是累了，等他休息之后
你就看到他“天空之王”的本色了
-你为啥那样冲我笑？
-哦，我笑了？
我得睡了
人得知道休息
祖寇殿下，你该睡觉了
即使你是对的，降世神通还活着，你也不会找到他的
你父皇，先皇，及先皇的父皇都没能找到他。
那是因为他们没有找到诀窍，而我却找到了
他藏匿了多年了，该是时候揪他出来了
-嘿
-嘿
- 你在想什么？
-我是在想，
既然你是个御气师，你应该知道降世神通发生了什么
嗯，我我知道他，我是说，人们都知道他，但我不知道他怎样了，抱歉
- 我只是好奇而已，晚安。
-做个好梦。
安昂，安昂, 快醒醒
没事的，我们到村里了，过来见见我们的族人，大家都想见见你
安昂，这是我们族人。大家，这是 安昂。
嗯，他们为啥那么看我？
- 不是我身上有阿柏的鼻涕吧？
-我们已经多年没见到御气师了
在我的孙女孙子找到你之前，我们都认为你们族人已经灭绝了
- 灭绝了？
-安昂，这是我得祖母
叫我姥姥。
这是啥？武器吗？这玩艺能戳坏啥？
这不是戳东西用的，是用来辅助御气术的
是魔法啊，再做一遍吧
这不是魔术，这叫御气术，
他可以帮助我控制我周围的气流，帮助我飞行
瞎掰，人可不能飞
不信你就看看
他在飞啊！
太神奇了
天哪，我的瞭望塔
刚才真是太棒了
太好了，你是御气师，卡塔拉是御水师，
你本这下可以成天凑在一起玩过家家了
-你是御水师？
-算是吧，不过还不合格
好了，别玩了，卡塔拉，你还有家务要做
姥姥，我终于找到了个武师来教我了
-卡塔拉，别对他抱有太大希望。
-我有种预感，他很特别
我觉得他内涵深厚
看啊，我...的“鞋头”...粘上了
再来
错了，御火术的力量应该来自气息，而不是靠肌肉
气息转化为身体中的能量，这种能量通过四肢转化为火
- 这回好好做
-够了
我已经练基本功很长时间了，我早就准备好进入下一层修炼了
-你太浮躁了，你得夯实你得基本功
再来一遍
传言说最后的御气师就是降世神通，
他肯定已经多岁了
他花了多年掌握了种元素的力量，
单凭基本功我怎么能战胜他
你得教我点高级功夫
好吧，好吧，但我先得吃完我的烤鸭
伙计们，最重要的是你们要克服面对御火师时的恐惧
我们水族人要血战到底
只有有勇气的人才能叫做男人
-我想去小便。
-听着，在你们父亲回来之前，我们就是部落里男人，是顶梁柱
我们不能无组织，无纪律，散散漫漫的
-但我真的想去小便
-好吧，好吧，还有谁要去？
看到安昂了吗？曾祖母说他个小时前就不见了
噢，那里面可真冷啊
卡塔拉，赶紧把他带走，这是战士的上课时间
停下来，马上停下来
你有问题啊。大战期间我们可没有时间来玩乐
打仗了？你在说什么？
- 你是开玩笑吧？
-企鹅！
他是开玩笑的，对吧？
- 安昂?
-过来，过来，小东西
咱们去滑行吧
我会学它们走路
安昂，如果你教我御水术，我就教你怎么抓企鹅，怎么样？
说定了。只是我是御气师，不会御水术
你们部落没人能教你吗？
没有，我是这个部落唯一的御水师
御水术只有御水师才能教
北极不是还有个水部落吗？
-那的御水师应该能教你
-应该吧
但是我们已经很他们很久没联系了
他们在世界的另一端，到他们那可不容易
你忘了吧，我有飞天野牛阿柏，我可以载你去北极
-卡塔拉，我们会找到能教你的师傅的
-那个...我是说
到现在我还没离开过家呢
你先想想吧，现在，你先教我怎样抓企鹅吧
好吧，听仔细了，抓企鹅可是一项古老而又神秘的技术，看好了
-自从告别童年后，好久没像这样滑行了
-我们现在还是小孩啊
噢，那是什么？
这是火族的战船，对我的族人来说是不堪回首的回忆
安昂，别进去，这是禁区，船里有陷阱
如果你要成为一个御水师，你必须学会克服你得恐惧
这艘船在曾祖母还是小女孩时就有了，是火族第一次进攻时留下的
不是吧，全世界都有我得朋友，
火宗里也有，我怎么没听说过战争
- 安昂，你在冰川里待了多久
-不知道，也就几天吧
- 我想可能超过年
-什么？不可能，你看我像岁的老头吗？
好好想想，战争已经持续个世纪了，而你却不知道
唯一能解释的理由是这年你都在那个冰山里
-年，不可能吧
-安昂，我很抱歉。凡事要往好处看
-是啊，好在我遇见了你
-来吧，咱们出去吧
-安昂，咱们往回走吧，这地方太恐怖了
你刚才好像说过有陷阱哈？
抓紧了
最后的气宗，这老家伙看起来身手还不错嘛
叫醒我皇叔，告诉他我找到了降世神通
还有他们的藏身之所
