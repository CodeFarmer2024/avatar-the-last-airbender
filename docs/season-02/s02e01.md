      [Introduction sequence]

      Act I

      (The episode begins with a shot looking up at gray clouds and the camera
      then pans down, looking between two spire-like towers of the Southern Air
      Temple at a circular platform with the peaks of mountains peaking above
      the clouds in the background. Cut to a shot of the Air Temple, looking up
      from below. Aang runs on screen from the right, pauses and looks both
      ways, then runs off screen to the left.)

      Cut to a brown curtain. Aang pulls it open, looking at the screen with a
      surprised expression. Cut to behind Aang as he enters a room, the ceiling
      collapsed and a figure resembling himself sitting at the far end with his
      back to the screen. Aang stops. Cut to a close up of the figure at the end
      of the room, who turns around, revealing himself to be Aang as well. His
      eyes and the arrow symbol on his head are glowing blue. Cut back to Aang
      standing at the entrance to the room.)

      (Aang gasps)

      (The wind blows violently around Aang. The camera pans over to the other
      Aang, who is surrounded in an orb of wind. Sokka and Katara are lying in
      the foreground, shielding themselves from the wind. Cut to a close-up of
      the glowing Aang, who slams his hands together. Cut back to the shot of
      Sokka and Katara on the ground. A bright light from Aang envelops them.
      Cut to the real Aang, who is hit by the powerful blast of wind and thrown
      backward into the Fire Temple.)

      Aang: (as he falls) Aaahhh! (he lands on the floor of the Air Temple) Oof!

      (Cut to behind Aang, who watches as the intricate Fire Temple door opens,
      revealing the glowing Aang hovering behind it. Cut to a close up of the
      glowing Aang, his clothing billowing in the wind. Cut to a close up of his
      face, an angry scowl on it. He opens his mouth and fire shoots out, and
      the camera pans around as he performs a strike with his hand, causing the
      ground beneath the real Aang to melt. He falls into the chasm.)

      (He lands on the deck of a Fire Nation ship. Cut to behind Aang, who looks
      up and sees the Water Spirit from The Siege of the North Pt. II
      approaching the ship. Cut to in front of Aang, the camera zooming in on
      his surprised face. Cut to the glowing Aang, who is surrounded by blue
      light. He raises an arm, ready to strike. Cut to behind the real Aang, who
      watches as the water spirit mimics the action. The spirit strikes the
      ship. Cut to the glowing Aang, who once again does the striking motion
      that he used to break the ground beneath Aang before.)

      (Aang gasps awake and breathes hard. He is in a fur hammock beneath the
      deck of a ship. Cut to a scene of the entire room. Four such hammocks, two
      on each side, are in the room. Aang sits on the upper left, with Katara
      lying asleep in the lower right. Cut to a scene of Aang breathing hard. He
      jumps down from his hammock. Cut to a scene of him climbing a ladder with
      Katara in the foreground. She rises as he exits the screen.)

      Katara: Aang?

      (Cut to a close up of Katara&#x27;s face. Cut to full view of the ship. Cut
      again to above deck. Katara approaches Aang, who is looking out over the
      ocean.)

      Katara: Do you wanna talk about it?

      Aang: Nah. Just a nightmare.

      (Cut to a close-up of Aang&#x27;s face from above. He looks up at the camera as
      he talks.)

      Aang: (unsettled) I was in the Avatar state, but I was outside my body
      watching myself. It was scary. I was scary.

      (Katara puts her hand on Aang&#x27;s shoulder and looks out over the ocean.)

      (Cut to the same ship next morning. Master Pakku is on the deck of the
      ship with several other men from the Northern Water Tribe. He reaches into
      a bag and pulls out a triangle-shaped amulet.)

      Master Pakku: (in a serious and ceremonial manner) Katara, I want you to
      have this. (Cut to a close-up of the amulet, showing that it is a triangle
      with a wave-shaped pattern of blue color with a crescent moon on the top.)
      This amulet contains water from the Spirit Oasis. (Cut to behind Master
      Pakku as he hands the amulet to Katara, who is standing in front of Appa
      and next to Aang.) The water has unique properties. Don&#x27;t lose it. (His
      face softens.)

      Katara: (respectfully) Thank you, Master Pakku. (She embraces him and then
      walks off screen. Aang steps forward and Master Pakku produces an
      intricately-decorated brown box.)

      Master Pakku: Aang, these scrolls will help you master waterbending, but
      remember they&#x27;re no substitute for a real master.

      (Aang looks up at Katara, who is on top of Appa, and then exits to the
      left as Sokka steps forward.)

      Master Pakku: Sokka. (Sokka looks at him proudly and expectantly.) Take
      care, son. (Pakku pats Sokka&#x27;s arm, giving him nothing. Sokka&#x27;s expression
      becomes very dejected and embarrassed.)

      Master Pakku: Fly straight to the Earth Kingdom base to the east of here.
      General Fong will provide you with an escort to Omashu. There you&#x27;ll be
      safe to begin your earthbending training with King Bumi.

      Aang: Appa, yip yip!

      (Aang pulls the reigns and Appa lifts off. Cut to behind Master Pakku as
      he waves goodbye.)

      Katara: (calls back as they fly off) Say hi to Gran Gran for me!

      (Cut to a scene looking down at the ship as Appa flies toward the screen.)

      (Cut to a bathhouse stretching over a wide river. Cut to a scene of
      blossoming cherry trees. The camera pans down, revealing Iroh lying on his
      back.)

      Iroh: (contentedly, as he receives a massage from two attendants. Halfway
      through the speech the scene changes to show Zuko sitting to the side, his
      face concealed by a hat.) Aaahhh� this is what I&#x27;ve been missing. Who knew
      floating on a piece of driftwood for three weeks with no food or water and
      sea vultures waiting to pluck out your liver could make one so tense?

      (He casts a glance at Zuko and walks over to sit beside him on the floor.)

      Iroh: I see. It&#x27;s the anniversary, isn&#x27;t it?

      (Cut to a close-up of Zuko&#x27;s face, still hidden under the wide-brimmed
      hat.)

      Zuko: (dejectedly) Three years ago today I was banished. I lost it all.
      (He looks up suddenly.) I want it back. I want the Avatar, I want my
      honor, I want my throne. I want my father not to think I&#x27;m worthless.

      Iroh: (with exaggerated optimism) I&#x27;m sure he doesn&#x27;t! Why would he banish
      you if he didn&#x27;t care?

      (Zuko gets up and walks away. Cut to Iroh&#x27;s surprised face with the
      attendants in the background.)

      Iroh: (negatively to himself) Erg� that came out wrong, didn&#x27;t it?

      (Cut to Azula&#x27;s warship. Two lines of red armor-clad Fire Nation soldiers
      are standing on the deck, and fall to their knees as the elaborate cabin
      opens at the edge of the ship. Cut to a scene of four servants carrying a
      curtained platform between the lines of soldiers. They stop at the top of
      the stairs and pull apart the curtains, revealing Azula. Cut to a scene of
      her feet stepping out. Cut to behind her as she examines her soldiers. She
      raises a hand, then looks at the two rows. They rise and she begins to
      walk between them.)

      Azula: (to her men) My brother and my uncle have disgraced the Fire Lord
      and brought shame on all of us. You may have mixed feelings about
      attacking members of the royal family; I understand. But I assure you, if
      you hesitate, I will not hesitate to bring you down. Dismissed.

      (The troops quickly run off to the left, and a lone soldier approaches

      Captain: (respectfully) Princess, I&#x27;m afraid the tides will not allow us
      to bring the ship in to port before nightfall.

      (Cut to in front of Azula with the captain behind her. She turns and walks
      to the left as she speaks.)

      Azula: I&#x27;m sorry, Captain, but I do not know much about the tides. Can you
      explain something to me?

      (Cut to a profile of the captain.)

      Captain: Of course, Your Highness.

      (Cut to in front of Azula.)

      Azula: Do the tides command this ship?

      Captain: Uh� I&#x27;m afraid I do not understand.

      Azula: (condescendingly) You said the tides would not allow us to bring
      the ship in. Do the tides command this ship?

      (Cut back to the profile of the captain, who looks over at Azula
      nervously.)

      Captain: No, Princess.

      (Cut to behind Azula looking out over the ocean.)

      Azula: And if I were to have you thrown overboard, would the tides think
      twice about smashing you against the rocky shore?

      (Cut to profile of the captain, who gulps and closes his eyes.)

      Captain: (nervously) No, Princess.

      (Cut once more to behind Azula. She pushes a strand of hair from her face,
      then turns around while speaking.)

      Azula: Well, then, maybe you should worry less about the tides who&#x27;ve
      already made up their mind about killing you and worry more about me,
      who&#x27;s still mulling it over.

      Captain: (quickly) I&#x27;ll pull us in.

      (The captain bows respectfully and runs off toward the cabin. Azula glares
      at him as he leaves.)

      (Cut to Appa flying. Sokka leans on the edge looking bored, then suddenly
      stands up, looking excited. Cut to behind Appa overlooking the mountainous
      landscape. A circular, walled tower comes into view.)

      Sokka: (excitedly) There it is!

      (Cut to a closer view of the walled tower from above. Appa flied down
      toward it. Cut to a profile of the wall. Appa lands inside. Cut to a
      bearded man in a green cap and brown and green armor who steps forward.)

      General Fong: (graciously) Welcome, Avatar Aang! (Cut to a scene of Sokka
      stretching, Katara bringing their supplies down from Appa, and Aang
      rubbing his behind. They stop and look up at the General Fong. Cut back to
      Fong, who bows along with numerous soldiers behind him, then spreads his
      arms in greeting. ) I am General Fong. And welcome to all of you, great
      heroes! (Cut to the heroes as he mentions their names.) Appa, Momo, brave
      Sokka, the mighty Katara.

      Katara: (pleased) �Mighty Katara�? I like that.

      (Fireworks explode behind them, and the three turn to look at them. A
      group of four Earthbenders step forward, lifting small, green orbs from
      the ground and launching them into the air with their fists. Cut to a wide
      view of the tower with fireworks in the background. Cut back to Aang,
      Katara, and Sokka, who look amazed.)

      Sokka: Not bad, not bad.

      (Cut to inside of the base. The room is large, with green-lit columns on
      each side of a central walkway. A desk is seen at the far end, with a
      large banner showing a green circle and a brown square inside of it
      hanging from the ceiling. Aang, Sokka, and Katara sit in the center of the
      room on a mat, with Fong at the desk. The camera zooms in closer to them.)

      General Fong: Avatar Aang, we were all amazed at the stories of how you
      single-handedly wiped out an entire Fire Navy fleet at the North Pole.
      (Close up of Fong,e stroking his beard thoughtfully) I can&#x27;t imagine what
      it feels like to wield such devastating power. (He stops stroking.) It&#x27;s
      an awesome responsibility.

      (Cut to the three friends on the mat.)

      Aang: (humbly) I try not to think about it too much.

      (Cut to a close-up of Fong&#x27;s face. He smiles happily.)

      General Fong: Avatar� you&#x27;re ready to face the Fire Lord now.

      (Cut to a close up of Aang&#x27;s face. He seems content at first, but his
      expression quickly changes to one of surprised disbelief.)

      Aang: (alarmed) What?! No I&#x27;m not!

      (Cut to the three friends, with Katara closest to the camera.)

      Katara: Aang still needs to master all four elements.

      (Cut to a wide shot of Fong at his desk.)

      General Fong: Why? (becomes worked up as he speaks and rises from his
      desk) With the kind of power he possesses�power enough to destroy hundreds
      of battleships in a matter of minutes�he could defeat the Fire Lord now!

      (Cut back to the three, with Sokka raising his hand somewhat timidly.)

      Sokka: But, sir, the thing is Aang can only do those things when he&#x27;s in
      the Avatar state.

      Aang: See, it&#x27;s this special state where�

      (Cut to a side view of the room, with Fong at the left and the others at
      the right.)

      General Fong: (interrupts heatedly) I&#x27;m well aware. (he continues more
      gently) Your eyes and tattoos glow and you&#x27;re able to summon unbelievable
      power. (He walks around his desk, then the scene cuts to a map of the
      Avatar world, with Fong approaching it.) Without you we&#x27;d be slaughtered
      before we even reach their shores. (Cut to in front of Fong, with the
      others in the background.) But with you leading the way as the ultimate
      weapon, we could cut a swath right through to the heart of the Fire
      Nation. (He points at the map, drawing a line with his finger from the
      Earth Kingdom to the Fire Nation.)

      (Cut to Aang, who looks concerned.)

      Aang: (with uncertainty) Right� but I&#x27;m don&#x27;t know how to get in or out of
      the Avatar state, much less what to do once I&#x27;m there.

      (Cut back to in front of Fong. He turns around and faces the three.)

      General Fong: So it&#x27;s decided then. I&#x27;ll help you figure out how to get
      into the Avatar state, and then you&#x27;ll face your destiny.

      (The three stand up. Sokka and Aang look surprised while Katara seems
      angry.)

      Katara: (irritated) No, nothing&#x27;s decided. We already have a plan. Aang&#x27;s
      pursuing his destiny his way.

      (Cut to behind the three. Fong is once more at his desk.)

      General Fong: Well, while you take your time learning the elements, the
      war goes on. May I show you something?

      (Fong and Aang walk over to a circular window overlooking two
      orange-roofed buildings. A large crowd is standing outside one.)

      General Fong: That&#x27;s the infirmary, and those soldiers are the lucky ones.
      (Cut to a scene of injured soldiers walking toward the infirmary.) They
      came back. (Cut to looking in at Aang and Fong from outside the window.
      Aang looks down sadly.) Every day the Fire Nation takes lives. People are
      dying, Aang! You could end it, now! Think about it.

      (Cut to Azula&#x27;s battle ship and her lightning bending practice. The sun is
      setting in the background. Azula stands on the deck and brings her arms
      down in front of her. Cut to two old women watching from the top of the
      stairs.)

      (Azula swings an arm around, electricity sparking from her left hand. She
      brings it around in a circle, then begins to mimic the motion with her
      right hand, electricity shooting from her index and middle fingers. She
      brings her fingers together, and then lunges forward, launching a
      lightning bolt from her left hand. The lightning arcs over the edge of the
      ship. Cut to in front of Azula, her fingers smoking and a single strand of
      hair dangling in front of her face. Cut to the old women on the stairs.)

      Elder 1: Almost perfect.

      Elder 2: One hair out of place.

      (Cut to the same scene of Azula. The camera zooms in quickly as Azula
      glares angrily at the one strand of hair. She wipes it from her eyes.)

      Azula: �Almost&#x27; isn&#x27;t good enough!

      (She begins the training again and shoots lightning at the camera.)

      (Cut to Iroh being awakened, presumably by Azula&#x27;s lightning. He sits up
      in bed and stares out the doorway.)

      (Cut again to nightfall in the Earth Kingdom base.)

      (Cut to General Fong, looking down at a map on his desk.)

      Aang: (o.c.) General Fong?

      (Fong looks up, smiling. The scene cuts to a profile, with Fong at the
      left and Aang at the right.)

      General Fong: (warmly) Come in, Aang. Have you thought about our
      discussion?

      (The camera zooms in on Aang&#x27;s face.)

      Aang: (looks down in uncertainty) I&#x27;m in. (looks up with determination)
      I&#x27;ll fight the Fire Lord.

      (Cut to commercial.)

      Act II

      (Scene opens on the base again. Cut to the trio&#x27;s room. Aang enters the
      dimly-lit room from a door at the right. Cut to Aang walking across the
      room as Katara rises from her bed in the background, Momo sitting on her
      lap. Aang sits down on his bed.)

      Aang: (quietly) I told the general I&#x27;d help him� by going into the Avatar
      state.

      Katara: Aang, no. This is not the right way.

      (Cut to Sokka, who is lounging with his arms behind his head.)

      Sokka: Why not? Remember when he took out the Fire Navy? He was
      incredible.

      (Cut back to Aang and Katara.)

      Katara: There&#x27;s a right way to do this. Practice, study, and discipline.

      (Cut to a close-up of Sokka&#x27;s face.)

      Sokka: Or just glow it up and stop that Fire Lord.

      (Cut to looking over Sokka at the other two. Katara rises from her bed and
      approaches Aang and Sokka.)

      Katara: (angrily) If you two meatheads want to throw away everything we&#x27;ve
      worked for, fine. Go ahead and glow it up! (She exits to the right. Aang
      rises and starts after her.)

      Aang: (pleading) Katara, I&#x27;m just being realistic. I don&#x27;t have time to do
      this the right way. (He looks sad and almost ashamed.)

      (Cut to the base during the day. The camera pans to a cliff side away from
      the base with a small open-air building on top. Cut to a table with a
      steaming teapot while the teacher talks, dropping something into the
      teapot with chopsticks. )

      Teacher: This rare chi-enhancing tea is a natural stimulant. In an
      ordinary warrior it improves strength and energy ten-fold. In you, it may
      induce the Avatar state. (The teacher pours the team into a cup in front
      of Aang, who is sitting at the small table across from him and next to
      Fong. Sokka and Katara sit side-by-side a few feet behind Aang.)

      Aang: Ten-fold energy, huh? (slurps; twitch, twitch, twitch)

      (Aang begins to race around the small structure on his air ball while the
      others remain motionless.)

      Aang: (speaking in a fast, high-pitched, hyper voice while zipping
      everywhere on his air-scooter) Is it working, is it working? I can&#x27;t tell!
      Somebody tell me if I&#x27;m in the Avatar state �cause I don&#x27;t have a good
      view of myself! Am I talking too loud?

      Sokka: (Looking bored.) I guess he could talk the Fire Lord to death.

      Aang: (collides with a column, his air ball disappear and his shawl
      falling over his head.) Ooof!

      (Cut to outside at the entrance gate to the base. Aang and Katara sit on
      the ground while Fong stands behind them, stroking his beard. Sokka is in
      the foreground, his back to the camera and his arms folded behind his
      back.)

      Sokka: Maybe I can shock you into the Avatar state.

      Aang: (cheerfully) I love surprises.

      (Cut to Aang&#x27;s point of view. Katara covers his eyes with her hands. When
      she removes them, Momo&#x27;s head has replaced Sokka&#x27;s.)

      Momo: Raahh!

      (Cut to Aang, who lurches backward.)

      Aang: Aaahhh! (looks at his hands and holds them up) Still not glowing.

      (Sokka loses his balance. He yells while Momo chatters and they both
      topple over. Cut to General Fong, who just shakes his head.)

      (Cut to the inside of a temple. Aang stands in the center wearing a
      ridiculous hat with leaves coming out of the top and a blue cape. Fong,
      Sokka, and Katara stand at the right side of the screen. A priest is in
      the distance near a stairway.))

      Priest: (pretentiously) You are wearing a ceremonial piece of clothing
      from each of the bending nations. Now I will join the four elements into
      one! (As he mentions each element, he throws a pan of water, dirt, a
      torch, and blows air into a mixture.) Water, earth, fire, air! Four
      elements together as one! (throws mixture at Aang)

      (The mixture splatters over Aang, covering him in mud.)

      Aang: This is just mud!

      (Cut to the priest, who gives Aang an odd look.)

      Priest: So� do you feel anything?

      (Cut back to Aang, whose nose begins to twitch. He lifts up a finger. Cut
      to Fong, Sokka, and Katara, who look hopeful. Cut back to Aang as he
      sneezes.)

      Aang: Aaaaachoooo!

      (Cut back to the others, who get sprayed by mud from Aang&#x27;s sneeze. Fong
      wipes his face.)

      General Fong: (determined) We have to find a way.

      (Cut to the bathhouse. Iroh empties a bag of seashells on a table. He
      lifts a few, inspecting them.)

      Iroh: Look at these magnificent shells! I&#x27;ll enjoy these keepsakes for
      years to come.

      Zuko: We don&#x27;t need anymore useless things. You forget we have to carry
      everything ourselves now.

      Azula: (o.c.) Hello, brother. Uncle.

      (The camera pans out, revealing Azula at a table in the foreground, her
      hand on a seashell. Cut to Zuko and Iroh, who look surprised, and then
      angry. Zuko steps forward.)

      Zuko: (accusingly) What are you doing here?

      (Cut back to Azula. The camera looks up at her from below. She seems
      utterly unaffected by their glares. She toys with the seashell in her
      hand.)

      Azula: (arrogantly) In my country, we exchange a pleasant �hello&#x27; before
      asking questions. (She gets up and walks over to face Zuko.) Have you
      become uncivilized so soon, Zuzu?

      Zuko: (furiously) Don&#x27;t call me that!

      Iroh: To what do we owe this honor?

      (Cut to a close-up of Azula, still holding the seashell.)

      Azula: Hmm� must be a family trait. Both of you so quick to get to the
      point. (She shatters one of Iroh&#x27;s shells with her sharp nails on this
      last word. Iroh&#x27;s face darkens.) I&#x27;ve come with a message from home.
      Father&#x27;s changed his mind. Family is suddenly very important to him. He&#x27;s
      heard rumors of plans to overthrow him�treacherous plots. Family are the
      only ones you can really trust. (Her voice and face soften.) Father
      regrets your banishment. He wants you home.

      (Cut to Zuko, who looks out the window. The camera pans toward Azula.)

      Azula: (o.c.) Did you hear me? You should be happy. Excited. Grateful.
      (Camera returns to show her pleasant expression.) I just gave you great
      news.

      Iroh: I&#x27;m sure your brother just needs a moment to�

      Azula: (interrupting him angrily) Don&#x27;t interrupt, Uncle! (addresses Zuko.
      The camera pans to show his scarred face in the foreground, and Azula
      walks up beside him.) I still haven&#x27;t heard my thank you. I am not a
      messenger. I didn&#x27;t have to come all this way.

      Zuko: (with shocked and quiet disbelief) Father regrets? He� wants me
      back?

      Azula: I can see you need time to take this in. I&#x27;ll come to call on you
      tomorrow. Good evening. (Azula walks off screen to the right.)

      (Cut to the base in the evening. Aang and Katara are standing on the
      wall.)

      Katara: (o.c.) Can we talk about something?

      Aang: (o.c.) Sure.

      Katara: Do you remember when we were at the air temple and you found Monk
      Gyatso&#x27;s skeleton? It must have been so horrible and traumatic for you. I
      saw you get so upset that you weren&#x27;t even you anymore. I&#x27;m not saying the
      Avatar state doesn&#x27;t have incredible�and helpful�power. But you have to
      understand, for the people who love you, watching you be in that much rage
      and pain is really scary.

      Aang: I&#x27;m really glad you told me that. But I still need to do this.

      Katara: I don&#x27;t understand.

      Aang: No, you don&#x27;t. Every day more and more people die. I&#x27;m already a
      hundred years late. Defeating the Fire Lord is the only way to stop this
      war. I have to try it.

      Katara: (quietly) I can&#x27;t watch you do this to yourself. I&#x27;m not coming
      tomorrow. (She begins to walk off toward the screen, but pauses.)
      Goodnight. (She exits off screen.)

      Aang: (sadly) Goodnight.

      (Cut to nightfall at the bathhouse.)

      Zuko: (o.c., happily) We&#x27;re going home. After three long years. It&#x27;s
      unbelievable. (Zuko walks behind a thoughtful Iroh, carrying some folded
      clothing. He walks off to the right of the screen.))

      Iroh: (skeptically) It is unbelievable. I have never known my brother to
      regret anything.

      (Cut to a close-up of Zuko. At first he sounds surprised, and then
      forceful.)

      Zuko: Did you listen to Azula? Father&#x27;s realized how important family is
      to him. He cares about me.

      Iroh: I care about you. And if Ozai wants you back� well, I think it may
      not be for the reasons you imagine.

      Zuko: (defensively, turning his back to Iroh) You don&#x27;t know how my father
      feels about me. (He stiffens) You don&#x27;t know anything.

      (Cut to the scarred portion of Zuko&#x27;s face in the foreground with Iroh
      talking over his shoulder.)

      Iroh: (gently) Zuko, I only meant that in our family things are not always
      what they seem.

      (Zuko whirls around angrily and faces Iroh, leaning in as he accuses him.)

      Zuko: (nastily) I think you are exactly what you seem: a lazy,
      mistrustful, shallow old man who has always been jealous of his brother.

      (Zuko turns and walks away. Iroh looks on sadly, then closes his eyes.)

      (Cut to Aang&#x27;s dream. A river with icy cliffs on both banks is shown.
      Aang, glowing in the Avatar State, explodes from the river in a tall
      column of swirling water. He sours through the sky, then turns down toward
      a Fire Nation ship with the real Aang standing on the deck. The glowing
      Aang lands on the deck and swings his vortex of water like a whip at
      Aang.)

      Aang: (as the water vortex knocks him overboard) Aaahhh!

      (The glowing Aang stands in the foreground, with Zuko looking on behind
      him. The glowing Aang turns around, and Zuko briefly assumes a defensive
      stance before turning and running. Aang, no longer glowing, launches a
      water attack at him.)

      (Aang starts awake in bed and gasps. He turns over toward Sokka.)

      Aang: (softly) Sokka. Sokka, wake up.

      Sokka: (groggily) Wha...?

      (Aang sits up, looking weary.)

      Aang: I don&#x27;t think we should be trying to bring on the Avatar state.

      (Sokka looks over. His hair is down for once.)

      Sokka: You sure?

      Aang: Yes.

      (Sokka shrugs.)

      Sokka: (accepting) Okay.

      Aang: (apprehensive) Do you think the general will be mad?

      Sokka: What can he say? You&#x27;re the Avatar. Who knows better than you?

      (Sokka rolls over. Aang looks away, then lies back down, folding his arms
      behind his head.)

      (Cut to the stairway outside of the bathhouse. Zuko is descending quickly,
      a bag over his shoulder. He pauses for a moment and looks down at the Fire
      Nation ship in the bay below, then turns to continue on.)

      Iroh: (calling out urgently) Wait! (Cut to a full view of the staircase,
      with Iroh descending and waving behind Zuko.) Don&#x27;t leave without me!

      Zuko: (happily surprised) Uncle! You&#x27;ve changed your mind!

      Iroh: Family sticks together, right?

      (Cut to a close-up of Zuko&#x27;s face as Iroh puts a hand on his shoulder. He
      smiles happily. There is a sudden flashback to Iroh&#x27;s hand on the back of
      a young Zuko. Return to the present, and Zuko and Iroh both turn and look
      down at the ship below.)

      Zuko: We&#x27;re finally going home.

      (Zuko continues on, but Iroh takes a second glance at the ship. The camera
      zooms in on it. Cut back to Iroh, who looks skeptical.)

      (Cut back to the Earth Kingdom base. Aang stands inside the base in front
      of Fong&#x27;s desk.)

      Aang: The thing is, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll ever be able to trigger it on
      purpose. So, I guess that&#x27;s it.

      (Cut to Fong, who sounds disappointed when speaking.)

      General Fong: Sure I can&#x27;t change your mind?

      (Cut to Aang, who looks down sadly.)

      Aang: I&#x27;m sure. I can only reach the Avatar state when I&#x27;m in genuine
      danger.

      (Cut to Fong, who looks away.)

      General Fong: I see. I was afraid you&#x27;d say that.

      (Cut to Fong&#x27;s foot as he steps back, causing a small shock wave. He
      pushes forward, sending his desk flying at Aang. Cut to Aang, who looks
      surprised as the desk rams into him.)

      Aang: (gets hit with the desk) Ugh!

      (The desk rockets toward a window. Cut to Sokka, who tries to go after
      him, but is restrained by two guards.)

      Sokka: Aang!

      (Cut to outside the tower. The desk crashes through the wall. Both Aang
      and the desk fall toward the ground.

      Aang: (about to hit the ground) Aaahhh!

      (Using his Airbender abilities, Aang slows his fall with a gust of air. He
      tumbles forward, and the desk crashes and breaks apart behind him.)

      (Fong runs to the destroyed wall and points angrily at Aang.)

      General Fong: Men! Attack the Avatar!

      (Aang&#x27;s eyes widen in surprise as four groups of three guards close in
      around him.)

      (Cut to commercial)

      Act III

      (Aang looks up in surprise. Cut to Fong, who leaps down from the Tower and
      lands in front of Aang, sending a wave of moving earth toward Aang. He
      leaps over the wave.)

      Aang: What are you doing?

      (Cut to Fong, looking sinister.)

      General Fong: I believe we are about to get results.

      (The six Earthbenders on either side of Aang lift circular discs of earth
      with square holes in the middle around themselves, then hurl them at Aang.
      Cut to behind Aang. The first two roll toward him from both sides, and he
      steps backward, avoiding them. He leaps into the air and spreads his body
      horizontally as two discs fly above and below him. He sours toward the
      screen, then lands and peers over his shoulder. Other Earthbenders stand
      ready with more discs behind him.)

      Aang: I am not your enemy! I won&#x27;t fight you!

      (Four discs are launched at Aang, and he leaps over them as they collide
      right where he was standing. He lands on one of the upright discs, and
      another flies from the left and knocks it over. As he falls, two of the
      other upright discs close in around him. Cut to a profile, with Aang
      scrunched in the square holes in the discs as they begin to roll. The
      discs roll into an Earthbender, who shatters them. Aang goes flying and
      skids along the ground. He stands up, surveying the troops around him.)

      (Cut to Sokka, who is still being held by two guards in the tower. He
      lifts up his legs and slams his feet down on those of the guards. They
      look pained, and Sokka escapes as they fall down. He runs to the broken
      wall that Aang fell out of and looks down.)

      (Cut back to Aang. Four Earthbenders surround him, throwing their stone
      discs. Two collide horizontally and Aang leaps over them. The other two
      try to smash him between them, and he leaps through the hole in the middle
      of the one on the right. He zooms off on his ball of air while three
      Earthbenders try to raise walls of earth to stop him. He zig-zags between
      them. He shoots past two spear-wielding guards on ostrich-like creatures.
      They begin to chase after him. He starts up the wall of the base with the
      creatures in pursuit. He begins to tire out toward the top, his ball of
      wind disappearing and he just runs. The creatures close, and Aang barely
      misses their spears and begins to fall.)

      (Aang hits the ground and tumbles forward, the creatures jumping down
      behind him. He stumbles forward onto one of the disc-shaped portions of
      the floor. Fong lifts it up with his Earthbending skills, trapping Aang in
      the center hold and bringing him to him.)

      General Fong: You can&#x27;t run forever!

      Aang: You can&#x27;t fight forever!

      (Fong leaps forward, smashing the ring with his foot. Aang leaps away.)

      (Cut to Azula&#x27;s ship. A group of Fire Nation soldiers form two ranks along
      the path leading to the ship. Zuko and Iroh walk toward them. Cut to
      Azula, standing at the top of the stairs leading onto her ship, a soldier
      on each side. Cut back to Zuko and Iroh as they walk between the soldiers.
      Zuko looks content, while Iroh eyes them suspiciously. Cut to Azula, who
      raises her arms in greeting and bows to them.)

      Azula: Brother! Uncle! (Cut back to Zuko and Iroh, both bowing. Iroh opens
      one eye slightly, watching the soldiers beside him.) Welcome. I&#x27;m so glad
      you decided to come.

      (The two files of soldiers close in behind Zuko and Iroh.)

      Captain: Are we ready to depart, Your Highness?

      Azula: (pleasantly) Set our course for home, Captain.

      Zuko: (wistfully) Home�

      (Zuko and Iroh begin to climb the stairs onto the ship, the captain
      leading the way.)

      Captain: (to the other men) You heard the princess! Raise the anchors!
      We&#x27;re taking the prisoners ho� (stops abruptly, realizing his mistake)

      (Zuko and Iroh stop, looking surprised. Cut to Azula, who looks enraged.
      Cut back to the captain, his eyes wide.)

      Captain: (mortified) Your Highness� I�

      (Cut to Zuko, his eyes widening. Cut to Iroh, who looks to his left, then
      spins around, backhanding a guard off of the ship and kicking another down
      the incline. Another guard approaches from his left. He elbows him off the
      incline. He punches another that approaches from his right and grabs
      another, spinning him around and tossing him.)

      (Cut to Zuko. He grabs one guard, throwing him off the incline and into
      the water. He stalks up the incline, furious.)

      Zuko: You lied to me!

      (Cut to Azula, who appears confident.)

      Azula: (smugly) Like I&#x27;ve never done that before.

      (She turns and walks away, and two guards launch fire at the camera. Zuko
      brushes the fire aside and charges forward, screaming.)

      (Cut to the Earth Kingdom Base training yard o&#x27; doom)

      (Aang ruins away from the camera as four discs fall from the sky. He turns
      and begins to run to the left, with a disc rolling after him.)

      Aang: Aaahhh!

      (Cut to Katara and Momo in the upstairs room. Katara sits on her bed, her
      knees tucked up. The room shakes, and she and Momo look toward the camera.
      She glances down at Momo.)

      Katara: I wonder what crazy thing they&#x27;re trying now. (Cut to Momo, who
      makes a purring noise and closes his eyes.) Maybe we should just make sure
      Aang&#x27;s okay.

      (She gets up and leaves the room. Cut to outside the tower, where both
      Katara and Sokka are running down the stairs. They meet at the bottom.)

      Katara: (to Sokka) What&#x27;s going on?

      Sokka: The general&#x27;s gone crazy. He&#x27;s trying to force Aang into the Avatar
      state!

      (Sokka and Katara watch as Aang runs between two groups of soldiers. Sokka
      pulls out his boomerang and tosses it. Cut to behind one Earthbender.
      Right as he&#x27;s about to throw his disc at Aang, the Boomerange hits his
      helmet and knocks him out cold. His disc falls over.)

      (Cut to Aang, who is running from one of the birdlike creatures. Cut to
      his pursuer. Something shoots by, and he suddenly realizes that his spear
      his been cut in half. Cut to Katara, who has sliced the spear with a
      stream of water.)

      (Cut to Sokka, who is approaching one of the birdlike creatures, its rider
      unconscious on the ground. He has his arms lifted in the air as he slowly
      approaches.)

      Sokka: (nervous coaxing) Good bird/horse thingy.

      (He grabs the reins and leaps on the back of the creature. It takes off
      running. Katara remains stationary, and the camera zooms back, showing
      Fong in the foreground, lining up a group of discs around Katara. Cut to
      in front of him. Aang climbs the stairway of the tower behind him. He
      looks over his shoulder.)

      General Fong: Maybe you can avoid me, but she can&#x27;t.

      (The Earthbenders use their discs to create a v-shaped wall, making sure
      that the only means of escape is by General Fong. Katara throws her stream
      of water at Fong, but he raises a patch of dirt, creating a patch of mud.
      He takes up a fighting stance. Cut back to Katara, who spins around and
      begins to sink into the ground. She is up to her knees in dirt. She
      struggles to escape but doesn&#x27;t budge.)

      Katara: Aaahhh! (grunts, straining) I can&#x27;t move!

      (Cut to Aang, who looks enraged.)

      Aang: Don&#x27;t hurt her!

      (He leaps down from the staircase and shoots a stream of air at Fong. Cut
      to Fong, who looks surprised, but quickly raises a wall of earth to
      protect himself. He lowers the wall, the turns back to Katara, who sinks
      deeper into the ground.)

      Katara: (sinking deeper) Aaahhh!

      (Cut to Sokka, who rides out from behind one of the discs on his birdlike
      creature. He charges toward Fong.)

      Sokka: Katara! No! (Fong sinks the bird creature&#x27;s legs into the dirt and
      Sokka gets tossed from his ostrich, landing in the hole of one of the
      discs.) Waaaahhh! Oof!

      (Aang runs to to Fong, grabbing his arm.)

      Aang: Stop this! You have to let her go.

      (Fong looks down at Aang angrily.)

      General Fong: (maliciously) You could save her if you were in the Avatar
      state.

      (Cut to Aang&#x27;s face. He appears frustrated and desperate. Tears begin to
      form in his eyes.)

      Aang: (desperately) I&#x27;m trying� I&#x27;m trying!

      (Cut to Katara, who continues to sink further into the ground. She is now
      up to her armpits.)

      Katara: Aang, I&#x27;m sinking!

      (Cut back to Fong, whose tone sounds mocking.)

      General Fong: I don&#x27;t see glowing.

      (Fong pushes his fist toward the ground, and Katara sinks further, only
      her head remaining above ground.)

      Katara: (terrified) Aaahhh! Please!

      (Aang drops to the ground at Fongs feet, still clutching his hand.)

      Aang: (hysterical) You don&#x27;t need to do this!

      General Fong: Apparently I do.

      (Fong clenches his fist and Katara disappears totally into the ground.
      Aang dives for her, just barely missing her hands. Cut to the back of his
      head. The arrow mark on his head begins to glow, and he turns around,
      revealing that the Avatar State has been activated. He glares angrily at
      Fong as he rises.)

      (Cut to Fong, who lifts his fist into the air in victory.)

      General Fong: (exulting) It worked. It worked!

      (A strong blast of wind hits Fong, and he shields himself with his arms.
      Cut to Aang, who is standing in front of him, wind billowing around him.
      Cut back to Fong, who smiles, but the grin quickly fades as he becomes
      terrified. Cut back to Aang, who launches a karate chop-like attack at the
      screen. Cut to Fong, who goes flying backward. He lands at the base of the
      tower. Cut back to Aang, who lifts himself up in a vortex of dirt. The
      camera pans up into the sky, and the scene changes to Zuko leaping onto
      Azula&#x27;s ship.)

      (Cut to Azula&#x27;s ship. Zuko leaps on board, knocking two guards on either
      side out of the way with flames shooting from his arm and leg. Cut to a
      profile of the deck of the ship. Zuko takes up a fighting stance at the
      left while Azula remains motionless, her back to her brother. Cut to in
      front of Azula. She glances to her left and grins evilly. Cut to behind
      Zuko, who brings his arms down, fire daggers appearing in his fists. )

      (Cut to Iroh, who is fighting soldiers on the path leading to the ship. A
      soldier launches a kick at him, but a blast of fire from Iroh sends him
      flying. Two other soldiers approach from each side, and Iroh sends two
      blasts of fire at them, knocking them from the path. Another guard
      launches a fireball at Iroh&#x27;s face, but he avoids it, grabbing the
      soldier&#x27;s arm and putting a hand on his neck. Holding the guard, he turns
      toward the ship.)

      Iroh: Zuko! Let&#x27;s go!

      (He tosses the guard off the side of the path. Another approaches,
      throwing fire at the screen, but Iroh steps to the side and pushes him
      away with a palm to the face.)

      (Cut to the deck of the ship and Zuko. He swings his fire daggers at the
      camera ferociously. He swings his daggers at Azula repeatedly, but she
      simply avoid them. She grabs his arm and spins him around. Zuko is
      breathing hard.)

      Azula: You know Father blames Uncle for the loss at the North Pole. And he
      considers you a miserable failure for not finding the Avatar. (o.c.) Why
      would he want you back home, except to lock you up where you can no longer
      embarrass him?

      (Zuko brings out his fire daggers again and leaps at Azula, throwing a
      flaming kick at her head. She leaps back, nimbly dodging his blows. She
      swipes at his face with her fingernails. Zuko staggers back, revealing
      three cuts on his forehead. He charges forward and screams, swiping his
      daggers at Azula. She blocks his blows effortlessly and the fight
      continues up the stairs toward the cabin of the ship. She kicks Zuko,
      knocking him down the stairs a bit. He recovers quickly and charges back
      toward Azula. She blocks his fist and grabs his arm, bringing it down
      harmlessly. She glares at him, and Zuko&#x27;s eyes widen. She tosses a blue
      flame at his head, sending him tumbling down the incline. He lands with a
      thud and pulls himself up, looking back at the incline. Cut to Zuko&#x27;s
      point of view. His vision is blurry and shaky as he tries to locate Azula.
      She is standing at the top of the incline and begins to swing her arms in
      arcs around, lightning arcing around her. It is the same maneuver she was
      practicing earlier. She aims her fingers at Zuko and a lightning bolt
      shoots toward him.)

      (Cut to Iroh, who suddenly appears and grabs Azula&#x27;s fingers in his hand.
      He channels the electricity through his body and shoots it from his other
      hand, letting it explode harmlessly into the cliffside. He turns back to
      Azula and kicks her, sending her flying overboard. She splashes into the
      water. Cut to Iroh and Zuko, who are running down the path from the ship.)

      (Cut back to the Earth Kingdom base. Aang is still swirling in his vortex
      of dust with General Fong in the foreground. Cut to a close up of Fong,
      who cups his hands and shouts at Aang.)

      General Fong: Avatar Aang, can you hear me?! Your friend is safe! (He
      raises his arms and Katara emerges from the ground, gasping.) It was just
      a trick to trigger the Avatar state, AND IT WORKED!

      (Aang whirls around, his face angry. The vortex suddenly collapses and
      Aang slams into the ground, a cloud of dust shooting forward. Fong is sent
      flying. Large chunks of earth rise from the ground, sending Earth Kingdom
      soldiers into the air. The wave of destruction crashes into the buildings
      around the base, cracking them apart.)

      (Cut to Aang, who is hovering. His body suddenly glows blue, a surprised
      expression on his face. This blue spirit form leaves his glowing body and
      rises into the sky. Cut to a scene overlooking the wrecked base. Roku and
      Aang fly by quickly on Roku&#x27;s dragon. Cut to the two on the dragon, Roku
      looking back at Aang.)

      Roku: It&#x27;s time you learned.

      (The dragon flies off into golden clouds. Cut to a view of the clouds.
      There are figures standing on them. The dragon flies by. Cut to a close-up
      of Roku and Aang.)

      Roku: The Avatar state is a defense mechanism, designed to empower you
      with the skills and knowledge of all the past Avatars.

      (Cut to a female Avatar in a green robe and mask, holding fans. Her eyes
      glow briefly and she takes up a fighting stance. The camera zooms out,
      revealing two huge statues of mole-like creatures. They lift into the air
      and fly toward the screen.)

      Roku: The glow is the combination of all your past lives, focusing their
      energy through your body.

      (Cut to a male Avatar on the end of a ship. He&#x27;s wearing a blue coat and a
      white hat, presumably made of animal skin. His eyes blink as well, and the
      camera zooms out, revealing a huge tidal wave behind the ship.)

      (Cut to another female Avatar, whose eyes blink. She shoves her hands
      forward and the camera zooms out. Strong winds blow the yellow grass and
      trees in the distance.)

      Roku: In the avatar state you are at your most powerful, (Cut to another
      male Avatar in red armor. He lifts his arms and four volcanoes erupt in
      the background. The lava covers the screen. Cut back to Roku and Aang on
      the dragon.) but you are also at your most vulnerable.

      Aang: What do you mean?

      (Cut to a close-up of Roku&#x27;s face. The Avatars shown earlier can be seen
      on the clouds in the background. Roku and the Avatars suddenly vanish.
      They appear in a single-file line, their eyes glowing.)

      Roku: If you are killed in the Avatar state, the reincarnation cycle will
      be broken and the Avatar will cease to exist.

      (The Avatars vanish, ending with Roku, who fades away. Aang looks away
      sadly. Cut to the dragon, which spirals down toward the base. Cut to
      Aang&#x27;s physical body, a sphere of wind surrounding him. The dragon crashes
      into his body and disappears, as does the sphere of wind. His body goes
      limp, and Aang falls to the ground, no longer glowing. The glances at the
      ruins of the base around him.)

      (Cut to Katara, who runs toward the screen. Cut back to Aang, who is
      sitting on the ground with his arms on his knees. Katara runs up beside
      him and they embrace.)

      Aang: (tired and remorseful) I&#x27;m sorry, Katara. I hope you never have to
      see me like that again. (The two look up as Fong begins to speak.)

      (Cut to Fong, who walks forward, spreading his arms.)

      General Fong: Hah! Are you joking? That was almost perfect! We just have
      to find a way to control you when you&#x27;re like that.

      Aang: You&#x27;re out of your mind.

      General Fong: (ignoring him) I guess we&#x27;ll figure that out on the way to
      the Fire Nation.

      (Sokka rides up behind him on the birdlike creature, holding his
      boomerang.)

      Sokka: (bonks Fong on the head and knocks him out) Anybody got a problem
      with that?

      (Soldiers all shake their heads in unison)

      (Sokka dismounts from the creature. The soldiers approach the others and
      bow. The creature runs off in the background.)

      Soldier: Do you still want an escort to Omashu?

      Katara: I think we&#x27;re all set. (Momo lands in Aang&#x27;s arms.)

      (Cut to outside the base. Appa flies off toward the screen.)

      (Cut to the bathhouse)

      (Azula stands in the foreground, holding up a poster with pictures of Iroh
      and Zuko and some writing.)

      Azula: Anyone who harbors these traitors will face the wrath of the Fire
      Lord.

      (Cut to a group of citizens looking up at Azula from below. Civilians
      cower in fear. Cut to a close-up of Azula&#x27;s angry face.)

      Azula: (menacingly) There will be no place left to hide.

      (Cut to Zuko and Iroh on the run. Zuko&#x27;s shadow is seen in a river. The
      two run down a path, pausing at a small body of water at the side of the
      river. They collapse onto their knees.)

      Iroh: I think we&#x27;re safe here.

      (Zuko brings out a knife with some writing on the blade. He stares at it
      for a moment. Iroh nods solemnly and turns to Zuko. Zuko takes the knife
      and brings it behind his head and� cuts off his pony tail. He passes the
      knife to Iroh, who does the same. Cut to a close-up of Zuko&#x27;s hand as he
      releases the pony tail, letting it fall into the water. Zuko and Iroh&#x27;s
      hair are seen floating down the river. Cut back to Zuko and Iroh, their
      backs to the camera as they look into the distance.)

水善国
土强国
火烈国
气和国
很久以前，这四大国和谐共处
然而，烈火国发起的战争结束了和平
只有同时掌握四种元素的降世神通才能结束战争
然而在大家最需要他的时候，他却消失了
年后，我和哥哥发现了转世的降世神通，
他是个御气师，名叫“安昂”
尽管他的御气术着实厉害
在拯救苍生之前，他要学的还有很多
但是我坚信
安昂 能拯救这个世界
-=降世神通=-
最后的气宗

第二卷
土
第一回
神通形态
安昂
不想谈谈吗？
没什么，只是个噩梦而已
我梦见自己正处于神通形态
不过我好像灵魂出窍了，就那样看着自己
那场景好可怕呀
我真的好怕
卡塔拉
这条护身符是给你的
这个护身符中盛着来自神灵绿洲的水
这种水很特别
千万别把它弄丢了
多谢，帕库大师
安昂，把这些卷轴拿去吧，继续钻研御水术
不过不要死读书，记得要常常请教你的新师傅
索卡
孩子，保重啊
向东飞，直接去土强国的基地
冯将军会护送你们去奥玛舒的
到了那儿就安全了
可以师从布米王开始御土术的修炼
阿柏，驾，驾
替我向姥姥问好
真是好久都没这么舒服了
在那个小舢板上没水没粮的飘了三个星期
还得时刻堤防那些惦记着咱们肝脏的海秃鹫
简直就不是人过的日子
是啊，都已经三年了啊
三年前的今天我被驱逐了
我失去了所有
我要把它们都夺回来
我要抓住降世神通，找回我的荣耀，我的王位
不要再让父皇认为我是个没用的废物
他不会那么想的，
如果他不关心你又怎么会驱逐你呢？
呃，看来我又说错话了
我的皇兄和皇叔让父皇蒙羞
给我们大家都带来了耻辱
皇室成员同室操戈，肯定让你们左右为难
这我了解
但是如果在抓他们时，你们犹犹豫豫，
畏首畏尾，可不要怪我心狠手辣
解散
公主
现在风浪太大，恐怕在黄昏时无法到达港口
抱歉啊，船长，风浪的事我并不在行，
你能给我解释一下吗？
我很乐意，公主殿下
是风浪在指挥这艘船吗？
呃, 恕臣愚钝，您此言何意？
你不是说风浪不能让我们及时到达吗？
那么说是风浪在指挥这艘舰船了？
当然不是了，公主殿下
如果我把你从船上扔下去
风浪还会照样把你拍死在乱石滩，它会心慈手软吗？
当然不会了，公主殿下
这么说
无论怎样风浪都不会放过你的小命
你又何必要去逢迎它呢，反过来
你倒是要讨好讨好我，
干得好，我倒是可以留你一命
臣一定会倾力而为的
咱们到了
欢迎您，降世神通
在下冯将军
各位英雄好汉，也同样欢迎你们的到来
阿柏，模模，勇敢的索卡，还有强势的卡塔拉
“强势的卡塔拉”，这个称号我喜欢
不错嘛，不错嘛
安昂神通
您在北极单枪匹马除掉火宗舰队的...
英雄事迹真是让我们大开眼界啊
能够发出这么大的毁坏力量真是不可思议
能肩负这样的责任真得很棒啊
我尽量不去考虑太多
神通啊
你的力量已经能够与火王一战了
什么？！
我还不行
安昂仍然需要掌握所有四种元素
干嘛还要费那事
他现在拥有的力量
可以在短短几分钟内摧毁数以百计的战船
用来战败烈火王简直是绰绰有余
但是将军，安昂只有在处于
神通形态时才能发出那种力量
你要知道，那是一个特别的形态...
这我清楚，进入神通形态时，你的眼睛和纹身
都会发光，身体将会聚集不可思议的能量
倘若没有你，我们在到这儿前可能就被火宗给屠了
但是如果有你的领导
你就像是个终极武器，我们可以直捣烈火国的老巢
话虽如此，不过我不知道怎样才能自由出入神通形态
即便是进入了神通形态，我也不知该如何控制
就这么决定了吧
我帮助你们找到进入神通形态的方法，
之后神通就可以履行你的使命了
不行，我们可没有答应
我们已有计划了
安昂需要按着他自己的方法来完成他的使命
嗯
在你还在学着掌握那些元素时，战争仍在继续
来吧，我带你们出去看看
那儿是医疗室，这些士兵们还算是幸运的
至少他们活着回来了
每一天都有人死在火宗人手里，
安昂，人民需要你啊
现在，你就可以结束这一切
好好考虑考虑吧
差不多...
...完美了
就差分毫了
我的字典里可没有“差不多“
冯将军
进来吧，安昂
认真考虑过我们谈的事情了吗？
考虑过了，我会与烈火王决一死战的
我和将军说过了，我会帮他...
我会试着进入神通形态
安昂，不要，这么做不对
怎么会？难道你忘了他是怎么收拾
那些火宗军舰的，简直棒透了
安昂应该循序渐进
边实践，边学习，边训练
干嘛那么费事，把自己弄亮就可以和烈火王单挑了
你们俩想让咱们的前功尽弃，我无所谓
随便你们吧，发光去吧
卡塔拉，我只是想做点实事
时间不等人，不能按原计划进行了
这种稀有的养生茶是一种天然的兴奋剂
它可以使普通战士的战斗力增强至少十倍
没准它能激发你进入神通形态
真的可以增强倍？
管用了吗？管用了吗？
能告诉我吗，我现在是在神通形态吗？
你也知道，我自己不太清楚
我是不是说话太大声了？
我想他可以把烈火王唠叨死
也许突然吓你一下，就能进入神通形态了
吓我吧，我喜欢
还是没有发光啊
现在披在你身上的，是各御术国举行仪式时礼服
现在我将四种元素汇集起来
水
土
火
气
四元素合一
烂泥巴而已
那...你没啥感觉吗？
咱们得再想点其他方法
看，这些贝壳多大呀
我要多留几个做纪念
留这些东西有什么用
别忘了现在咱们得自己背东西了
好久不见啊，皇兄
皇叔
你来这儿干嘛？
真没礼貌啊，人家可是在和你问好呢
你什么时候变得这么没教养了，祖祖
别那么叫我
是什么风把你吹到这儿的？
咱们真是一家人啊，这么快就切入正题了
我远道而来，带来了父王的旨意
父王改变了想法
他突然觉得家庭对他来说十分重要
他听说有人要谋朝篡位，
这个时候，他只能信赖自己的家人
父王后悔当初驱逐了你，他期盼着你回家
你没听见我说什么吗？
你应该感到高兴、兴奋、感激涕零啊
我可是给你带来了天大的好消息
我想你的皇兄需要一些时间来...
这儿没你的事，皇叔
你也不对我说声谢谢
我又不是信差，本没必要大老远的来这儿
父王后悔了？他...
...想让我回去？
看来你需要时间来接受这个事实
那我明天再来叫你走吧，晚安
咱们能谈谈吗？
当然
你还记得当初在气和寺
咱们发现雅俗大师尸骨的时候吗？
那时的你好恐怖啊
想必那时的你也一定很痛苦吧
你当时好失落，好像那个人都不是你了
我承认，你在神通形态会拥有巨大的力量，
那力量会帮助我们取得胜利
但是你也要知道
对于挚爱你的人来说
目睹你陷于暴怒和痛苦之中
是一件及其恐怖而残忍的经历
很高兴你能跟我这么说
但是我还要继续试下去
你这又是何苦呢？
你不明白
每天都会有更多的人死去，
我已经逃避了一百年了
只有与烈火王一战才能阻止战争
我必须试一试
我不忍心看你这样作践自己
明天我不会去了
晚安
晚安
三年了，我们终于要回家了
真是难以置信啊
可不是嘛
我皇兄从未为任何事后悔过
你没听阿祖拉说吗？
父王意识到家庭的重要了
他在乎我
在乎你的人是我
欧宰想要你回去定有不可告人的目的
你怎么会了解父王对我的感情
你什么都不知道
祖寇
我只是想让你知道， 皇家的事并没有看上去那么简单
我只知道你和看起来一样，是一个懒惰、
多疑、浅薄，一直嫉妒他的皇兄的糟老头
索卡，索卡，快起来
咱们不应该继续尝试进入神通形态了
-你确定吗？
-确定
那好吧
将军该不会疯掉吧
他能拿你怎么样，你可是降世神通啊
谁能比你更了解自己呢？
等等
我跟你一起走
皇叔，你改变主意了
咱们可是一家人啊，不是吗？
咱们终于要回家了
其实
我以前进入神通形态都不是故意为之的
我想，咱们的尝试就到此结束吧
你已经决定了？
是的
只有在十分危急的时刻我才能进入神通形态
我明白了
看来只有这样办了
安昂
来人哪！给我攻击神通
你要干什么？
看来结果就要揭晓了
我不是你的敌人
我不会和你打的
你不能一直躲下去的
你打打也就没力气了
皇兄，皇叔，欢迎欢迎啊
你们能来真是太好了
殿下，咱们可以出发了吗？
船长，准备启程回家
家...
传公主令！起锚！带囚犯回国
公主殿下...我...
你居然骗我
好像我从前没骗过你似的
不知道他们现在尝试的怎么样了
也许咱们应该过去看看安昂
发生什么事了？
将军他发飚了
他想逼安昂进入神通形态
好鸟...马... 谁知道你叫啥，乖
也许你可以避开我
她可不见得
我动不了了
别伤害她
卡塔拉
不要啊
快住手！赶快放了她
你只要乖乖的进入神通形态就能救他了
我在努力，努力着呢
安昂，我要沉下去了
-你可还没发光呢
-啊！快救我啊！
你干嘛要这么做啊？
看来我是对的
成了，成了
祖寇，咱们走
你要知道，父皇将北极的失败归咎于皇叔
没能抓到神通，在父皇眼里你就是个废物
他怎么会想要你们回家呢
就应该把你们找个没人的地方关起来，
省得再出来给父皇丢脸
神通，你能听见吗？你的朋友是安全的
这只是让你进入神通状态所用的计策
看来这管用了
该是你学习的时候了
神通状态是一个防御体系
是为了你能够贯通前世的技能与知识而创
当你与所有的前世合体时就会发光
他们的功力就会注入你的躯体
在神通状态下你的力量会达到最强
但此时也有最致命的弱点
你此话怎讲？
如果你在神通状态下被杀死
神通再生的循环将就此终止
神通也将不复存在
抱歉，卡塔拉，希望你再也不要看见那样的我了
哈！别开玩笑了，刚才那一幕真是太完美了
我们终于找到了让你进入神通状态的方法了
你简直是疯了
我想在咱们讨伐烈火国的途中一定会继续完善的
你们谁有异议吗？
您仍然需要人手护送去奥玛舒吗？
我们已经准备好要上路了
谁要是敢庇护这两个叛徒，
我将毫不手软，格杀勿论
看你们能跑到哪去
我想我们在这儿很安全

第二卷
土
第二回
情人洞
我说，你俩练练就得了吧
如果想今天就赶到奥玛舒，还有好多路要赶呢
就会说我们，也不知道谁现在正光着呢
我随时都能准备好，两分钟内就能准备好开拔
那个，你刚才教我的是“章鱼式”吗？
没错，摆好姿势让我看看
你的双臂离得太远了
要像这样，让两臂靠拢才能保护你的中路，明白吗？
哦，是啊，谢了
好吧，让我看看你掌握得咋样了
安昂徒弟，你这招“章鱼式”摆的不错嘛
*路边的野花你不要采，小心被甩没呀没人睬*
嘿，住河里的朋友们你们好吗？
我们才不住在河里呢
是吗？那你们又属于哪类人哩？
普通人...而已
四海之内皆兄弟啊
你又是哪位？
我姓崇，这是内人丽丽
我们是流浪者，四海为家
你们是流浪者？太棒了，我也是
好巧啊，我也是
我已经知道了，你刚才说过
是吗？短裤不赖嘛
哪儿都找不到吃的
这种生活我真是受够了
我怎么就成了逃犯了
真是难以置信
皇叔，你干嘛呢？
这可是十分罕见的白龙草
它的叶子可以制成清香芬芳，沁人心脾的香茶
不过，
这也可能是株有毒的浪荡草
茶又不能顶饿，咱们需要吃的先
我去打鱼了
这到底是茶草还是毒草呢？
嘿，索卡，这几个人哪儿都去过了，
他们的故事老好听了
我们也不是哪儿都去过了，小箭头
不过那些没去过的地方
我们也都从故事和歌曲中了解到了
他们说能带我们去看巨大的夜行爬行动物
在途中还能路过一个瀑布呢，
那里还有看不到边的彩虹
听着，我也讨厌像卡塔拉那样唠唠叨叨的，
不过有些话我不得不说
我们得赶往奥玛舒
不许磨蹭，也没功夫看什么爬虫，更别提什么彩虹了
哇哦，看来有些人得了“目的地狂躁症”了
不要为去哪里而过于烦心
终点并不重要，重要的要享受旅行的过程
奥
玛
舒
索卡说的没错
我们得找到布米王，
这样安昂才能无后顾之忧的学习御土术
这么说，你们要去往奥玛舒喽
相传，就在山中
有条通往奥玛舒的密道
那不会只是个传说吧
哦，那可是个真实的传说
这个故事还要追溯到御土术发源的时候
*相爱两人，不能相见*
*战火纷飞，两地相思*
*山峦怎能阻挡*
*有情人终相聚*
下面几句歌词我有点忘了，
不过副歌部分我还记得
*秘密隧道*
*秘密隧道*
*穿越山的阻隔*
*秘密的，秘密的，
秘密的，秘密的隧道！耶！*
我想咱们还是飞着去吧，咱们从前和火宗人交过手
他们不足为惧
是啊，多谢帮忙，可是阿柏讨厌走地道
我们得优先阿柏，考虑它的感受
发射！
咱们还是走秘密的情人洞吧
祖寇，还记得那株像茶的草吗？
你不是...
你猜对了
的确不是茶草
如果这些疹子扩散到喉咙，我就不能喘气了
好在我找到了这个
这些“拔萃莓”是那些白色浪荡草的解药
不过也有可能是种致盲的毒莓
我可不能再让你乱吃这些植物了
咱们得找人帮忙
但是咱们能去哪儿呢？
我们既是土强国的敌人，又是烈火国的逃犯
如果被土强国的人抓到我们，肯定活不了
如果烈火国的人找到咱们，肯定会落到阿祖拉手里
那还是去土强国吧
还要走多久才到啊
实际上，隧道不止一个
那对爱人不想让其他人发现他们，
所以他们建了一座迷宫
迷宫？！
我们一定能走出去的
据说那个迷宫有个诅咒，但只要相信爱就能走出迷宫
还有诅咒？！
嘿，嘿，我们到了
那个诅咒具体是怎么说的？
只有那些相信爱的人才能走出这个洞穴
否则便会永远的困在迷宫当中
然后孤独的死去
没错，然后死去
嘿，我想起剩下的那几句歌词了
*孤独死去*
算了，咱们可不能走这个被诅咒的洞穴
看哪，是谁弄了那么大堆的篝火
那可不是什么篝火，穆库
那是火宗的军队
他们在跟踪我们
看来咱们只能相信爱的力量，穿越这些洞穴喽
说的没错，箭头大师
我们一定能走出去的
大家快进洞
且慢，进去太危险了
你没听过那首歌吗？
不如咱们把洞口封死
就让他们在洞里面自生自灭吧
没事的，阿柏，我们会没事的
但愿吧
我们会没事的
我们现在需要想个计划，崇，那些火把能点多长时间
呃，每个能点一个时辰吧
我们还剩下五个火把，那也就是...五个时辰
你把它们都点着了干嘛，
后四个时辰你想摸黑啊
哦，有道理
我现在要做个地图，这样就能知道已经去过哪了
咱们可以像玩迷宫游戏一样顺利走出去
你俩想必不是本地人吧
俺们这儿的人可没人敢碰那种浪荡草，更别提泡茶了
你们是打哪儿来的
我们只是路过，路过
那你们总该有名字吧？
名字...
我们当然有名字了
我姓李，他是我叔叔，呃，名叫“木须”
没错，我侄子跟他的父亲同名，
所以我们叫他“小李子”
木须和小李子，知道了
我的名字叫“如歌”
你们两个看起来饿坏了
不如留下来吃晚饭吧
抱歉，我们还要赶路
那太遗憾了，看来我母亲今天多做的烤鸭要白瞎了
你家具体住哪儿啊？
索卡，瞧你这路领的，咱们都连碰十个死胡同了
不可能啊，我们好像走过这儿
我们不需要什么地图，只要有爱指引我们就行了
那小家伙都知道这个道理
没错，不过有个地图也不错嘛
有点不对头
只有一个解释
整个隧道在不断变化
听我女儿说你们是流浪者
我们也曾四处流浪
我还是小女孩时，火宗人袭击了我们的村庄
所有的男人都被带走了
从那以后我再也没见过俺爹
我也有很多年没见过我的父亲了
是吗，也是由于战争的原因吗？
没错
这隧道...在变化，肯定是诅咒灵验了
我就说嘛，咱们不应该进隧道的
是啊，要是早听你的就好了~
大家都别出声，听
好像有个巨大的东西朝这儿来了，
好像还长着牙
不好，是“狼蝠”
没用的，我们被分开了
不过好在你还跟我们在一起，呵呵
不要啊！
介意我坐在这儿吗？
我能了解你的感受
我们也经历过那些事情
这伤是火宗弄得吧
会没事的
我身上也有他们留下的伤痕
*哦，被洞穴困住没什么大不了*
*就算世界末日，微笑也比皱眉好*
*这区区隧道哪能把咱们给难倒，嘿*
*这洞穴没什么大不了，索卡*
看哪，安昂
我们找到出口了
这不是什么出口
不是吧
这是一座墓穴
他们想必就是传说中的那对恋人吧
这儿是他们的墓穴
这些图画讲述了他们的故事
他们在这座分隔两个村庄的山上邂逅
两村世代为敌，所以他们不能走到一起
他们深爱彼此，终于找到了相见的方法
这对恋人从獾鼠那儿学会了御土术，
他们就是第一代的御土师
他们为了能够秘密的相见，煞费苦心的建造了这些隧道
那些试图跟踪他们的人都会永远的困在这座迷宫中
但是有一天，那位男子没能如约前往
他在两村的争斗中死去了
那女子悲痛欲绝，她的御土术发出了不可思议的力量
她的力量本可以夷平两座村庄
然而，她却用那力量平息了战争
两村的人民齐心协力建造了
一座新的城市，从此和平相处
那名女子名叫奥玛，而那位男子名叫舒
为了见证这段伟大的爱情，
那座城从此得名为“奥玛舒”
爱就是黑暗中的明灯
真是太好了，你的计划
又把我们带到了一个死胡同
至少我为了咱们能走出这里，还在动脑筋想办法
穆库
哇哦，哇哦，等等
我们也在想办法...你看我都想了一个小时了
是啊，你们可不都在想办法嘛
我说，既然爱是走出这里的关键
不如我们唱首爱的歌曲吧，兴许管用
我们怎样才能走出隧道呢？
我有一个疯狂的想法
是啥?
算了，那想法太疯狂了
卡塔拉，但说无妨
我在想...
....那诅咒不是说嘛，只要我们相信爱就能走出这里
没错
这儿又说“爱就是黑暗中的明灯”
这儿还有个接吻的图画
你的意思是...
那个...
如果我们接吻的话...
咱们接吻？
看吧，我说这主意很疯狂嘛？
咱们...接吻...
咱们接吻，我都在想啥呢？
你能想象吗？
没错，呵呵
我可不想跟你接吻
哦，跟我接吻就那么糟糕吗？
抱歉，就当我没提过
不是，不是，我的意思是...如果让我在和你接吻与死掉之间选择的话
怎么了？我是说我宁愿和你接吻
也不想死，我是想恭维你来着
我倒是宁愿死也不想跟你接吻
瞧这事让我给办的
*爱就在心间，永远也不会消逝*
多谢您的烤鸭，真是太美味了
哪里哪里
看您吃的津津有味，我真是很开心哪
您见笑了
小李子，怎么这么没礼貌呢，
还不赶快谢谢人家的款待
多谢了
我想你可能放弃了对这世界的希望
但是希望还在
降世神通已经回来了
这我知道
你怎么能这么做？那些人对咱们这么好
也许还不够好，不上来吗？
看来我们很快就要摸黑前进了
是啊
咱们现在该怎么办呢
咱们又能做些什么呢？
嘿，真有你的，索卡
不是我，它们好像正在躲些什么
躲什么？
嘿，这些动物爱听音乐哟
*乖獾鼠，快过来，帮我们，找出路*
*大獾鼠哦，隧道里住哦，讨厌狼蝠，却爱音乐哟*
好像是用某种水晶石做成的
这就是所谓的“黑暗中的明灯”吧
怪不得那对恋人能找到对方，
原来是有这些水晶石给他们指引
那肯定就是出去的路了
那个...嗯...
咱们走吧
那索卡该怎么办啊？
索卡
你们是怎么走出来的
就像传说中说的那样，有爱给我们引路
真的吗？我们可是有巨兽带路
你额头上怎么红红的
我说完了，你可不要太惊讶啊
这孩子可能就是降世神通
我说，不跟我们一起去奥玛舒吗？
不去了
那好吧，多谢照顾，穆库
索卡
索卡，我想今天你一定学到了，
不要被计划牵着鼻子走
你还是唱好你的歌吧
嘿，好主意
*爱就在心间，永远也不会消逝，哦~~~~*
这次旅行真是又臭又长，
不过好在我们马上就要到达目的地了
请允许我向你们介绍，土强国城池：奥...
噢，糟糕

第三回
重返奥玛舒
怎么会这样，我知道战火正在四处蔓延，
可是奥玛舒一直都是...
...固若金汤
看来还是没能守住
恐怕现在土强国只剩下永固城一座城池了
我知道这真的很糟
但是我们还要继续走下去
不行，我得去找布米
安昂，且慢，我们甚至都不知道布米是否还...
怎样？还怎么样？
...还在这附近
我知道你一心想和布米学习御土术
不过御土术老师还有很多
我在意的并不是给自己找个老师
而是要找到我的朋友
有条秘密通道？上次来的时候咱们怎么不用呢？
这个回答你满意吗？
还好，没我想象的那么糟
怎么弄不掉它们啊？快来帮忙
别大吵大嚷的，只不过是紫色五角章鱼罢了
谁在那儿？
都过了宵禁了
你们这几个毛孩子还在外面瞎逛啥
抱歉，我们正往家赶呢
等等，那孩子怎么了？
那个...长官，他得了五角天花
呃...传染性很高的呢
呜~~太难受了....我要死了...
得了这病小命恐怕不保
等等，我好像听说过这个病
你那个叫常的表弟就是得这病死的吧
咱们回去赶紧把手洗洗...
要不然把衣服也烧了吧
谢谢你了
住在下水道里的朋友
追踪你的皇兄和皇叔的时候
最好不要再用皇家部队了
这样下去的话
很容易打草惊蛇的
说的没错，整个军队出击太过招摇了
我必须出奇制胜
我需要一支精锐的小分队
该是时候去会会老朋友了
找到布米，然后赶快离开这儿
他们会把他关在哪儿呢？
肯定是不能用御土术的地方
应该是金属做成的地方
我对这个地方的憎恨真有如滔滔江水连绵不绝
梅，你父亲刚刚被提为总督
咱们在这儿就相当于是土皇帝
开心点，要学会享受生活
目标正在接近
把他们给我干掉
原来以为烈火国就够无聊的
没想到这个地方更加无趣
居然啥事也没发生过
是抵抗军
泰丽，真的是你吗？
阿祖拉
能见到你真是太好了
希望我没有打扰你练...的那个啥
说实话，你一个贵族千金来这儿干嘛呢
父母当初送我们去烈火皇家女子学院
可不是为了让我们在这种地方安身立命啊
我有个提议
我正在抓捕一个叛徒
还记得我那个唠唠叨叨的邋遢皇叔吗？
哦，记得，他相当风趣了
你要是能加入我的队伍就太好了
哦...我...呃....倒是很愿意
但是你得知道，我现在在这儿很高兴
我的心情好久都没有这么爽了
既然你都这么说了
我怎么能为了让自己高兴而断送了你的幸福呢
我谢你啊，阿祖拉
对了，我走之前一定会去看你表演的
呃...耶...那当然...没问题
我说，布米王跟你们在一起吗？
是他领导着抵抗军吗？
他可不在这儿，就在敌人入侵的那一天
我们都在积极备战，誓死要守住城池
为了我们的生活和自由而战
可我们还没来不及动手呢
布米王就投降了
就在敌人入侵的那天
我去问布米王该怎么做
他看着我的眼睛，说...
我准备开城...投降
现在也无所谓了
为了自由我们要跟烈火国决一死战
为了自由，死也值得
实际上还有其他途径可以得到自由的
你们可以离开奥玛舒啊
现在你们虽然孤注一掷的对抗烈火国
可是现在的形式是敌众我寡，胜不了的
正所谓“留得青山在，不怕没柴烧”
你哪会知道，他们夺去了我们的家园
我们当然要殊死抗争
我觉得那句“留得青山在，不怕没柴烧”挺有道理的
没错，那孩子说得对
那好吧，不过要让这么多的人安然离开可不是易事
我们该怎么办呢？
山人自有妙计
（Sucker：吸盘）
看来大家这回该得个五角天花玩玩了
现在看起来是像病了
还得麻烦大家装出病态来
就看大家的演技了
看见没，这就是样板
闹呢，俺可是老戏古了
大家各就各位，进入得病形态
安昂，你去干嘛，不和我们一道吗？
不了，找到布米之前我是不会离开的
抱歉了模模，我回头再喂你
瘟疫！瘟疫！
到底发生什么事了？
昨天在巡逻的时候看到几个得五角天花的小孩
肯定是疾病已经扩散了
五角天花，我之前好像听过这种病
啊，简直太恐怖了
-我们该怎么办呢？
-赶紧把他们驱出城外...记住谁也别碰他们啊
我们得让这个病在城中断根
老爹，来点“烈焰玉米片”
真是太糟了
弗洛布西！
来吧，弗洛布西，帮我找到布米
驾，驾！
哦，看来这口令对你来说不管用
咱们走吧
烈火王的千金能够光临敝团，我们真是不胜荣幸啊
嗯，如果有什么可以为您效劳的，请尽管开口
我可不客气
真是太精彩了，她不会摔下来吧？
-当然不会了
-咱们把网撤了应该会更有趣吧
-你要知道，这个...这些演员...
-没错，没错，撤网对他们是小儿科
-我知道了，还是把网给我点着了吧
-遵命，公主殿下
精彩，真精彩！
对了，你这儿都有什么猛兽啊
-哦，我们团的有来自世界各地的珍禽异兽...
-把它们都放出来吧
我们到处都找遍了，就是没找到布米
我们刚清点了一下人数，出了点小问题
不是吧，还有人没出城
不是的，是多个一口人
这么说，抵抗军绑架了我儿子
他们真是阴险狡诈啊，就和他们的布米王一样
长官，我们该怎么做
你的表演真是太精彩了
我都迫不及待的想看你明天的演出了
对不起，阿祖拉，明天我不会表演了
真的吗？
上天启示我，说该是转职的时候了
我想加入你的小支队
住手！真是个坏火宗小孩
好了...给你玩吧
哦~~你真是太可爱了，亲一个
他现在是可爱，不过等他长大了
定会加入火宗军队的
他肯定会成为一个“可爱”的杀手
你见过有长得这么可爱的杀手吗？
是信鹰
是那个火宗总督写来的
他认为是咱们绑架了他的儿子
所以...他想做个交易
用他的儿子换布米王
你得清楚那可能是火宗设的一个套
不会的，相信那个总督一定很想要回他的儿子
就像咱们想要回布米一样
新的一天开始了，我有好的预感
如果你是来杀我的，我将不胜荣幸
梅，真是好久不见了
你不是离家出走，去了什么马戏团吗？
你还说，宿命在召唤你
可能是阿祖拉召唤的声音更大些吧
我现在有个任务，需要你俩的帮忙
算我一个吧，这鬼地方我多一天也不想待
请您恕罪
现在正是奥玛舒的多事之秋
就在中午我们要和抵抗军作笔交易，换回我的儿子汤汤
你儿子的事我深表遗憾
不过你怎么那么草率就放走了那些市民
我父皇放心把这个城池交给你
却让你治理成这副德性
请您恕罪，公主殿下
你留在这儿，人质交换的事就交给梅来办吧
省得再让你给搞砸了
哦对了，这儿再也没有什么奥玛舒了
为了表示对父皇的尊重，这儿就改叫“新欧宰城”吧
嗨，大家好啊
-把我弟弟带来了吗
-带来了，咱们开始交换吧
请恕我无理，我有个想法想说一下
请说，阿祖拉公主
我们要用一位君王来换个二岁孩童
这位君王可是个巨强的御术师
好像这个交易不太公平啊
你说得没错
交易取消了
哇噢！回见了您哪
布米
降世神通
今天点儿真幸啊！
安昂，是你吗？
你这是打哪来啊？
坚持住！我这就救你出来
咱们得赶紧把这孩子带走
交给我了
安昂，先别吹了
能不能先歇会儿...啊~~
布米，这就像原来一样啊，不是吗？
安昂，咱们得好好谈谈
我见到你也很高兴
看你用不出御术还怎么跟我打
别忘了还有我呢
-安昂在那儿
-咱们去接应他
坚持住，布米，咱们的援军来了
你一直都能用御土术？
当然了，好在他们没挡住我的脸
那我就不明白了，你为什么不逃出来呢
为什么当初奥玛舒遭到进攻的时候你要投降
布米，你吃错药了吗？
听我说，安昂
武学讲究一个“劲”字
就是说在战斗时要学会活用你的能量
这我知道，在进攻时要用“正劲”
在撤退时要用“负劲”
而在啥也不做时要善用“中劲”
一共有三种“劲”？
实际上，一共有八十五种劲
不过“中劲”是精华所在
善用“中劲”才能用好御土术
就是说在进攻时要善于观察局势、把握时机
这就是你投降的原因？
没错，所以我现在还不能离开
看来我得找其他人来教我御土术了
你要拜善于使用“中劲”的人为师
他必须是那种在进攻前审时度势，善于倾听的人
嘿，模模
模模可是自学了不少种“劲”哩
后会有期啊，安昂
时机到时我们自会相见
这么说，你正在追踪你的皇兄和皇叔喽
梅，你巴不得赶快见到祖寇了吧~
现在目标不仅仅是祖寇和艾洛了
我们还有第三个目标
汤汤

水善国
土强国
火烈国
气和国
很久以前，这四大国和谐共处
然而，烈火国发起的战争结束了和平
只有同时掌握四种元素的降世神通才能结束战争
然而在大家最需要他的时候，他却消失了
年后，我和哥哥发现了转世的降世神通，
他是个御气师，名叫“安昂”
尽管他的御气术着实厉害
在拯救苍生之前，他要学的还有很多
但是我坚信
安昂 能拯救这个世界

第四回
沼泽
行行好，施舍施舍我这个窘迫的旅人吧
真是太丢脸了，我们可是皇族
他们应该排着队把他们最好的东西献上来
他们会给你的...只要你客气点
施舍施舍我这个饥饿的老头吧
好吧，这点钱给你了
您可真是个好心人，您笑的样子真是好美啊
快来给大爷我演个节目
演得好我就给你...一个金币
我们可不是卖艺的
我们只是不太专业罢了
*此去永固城路迢迢，为睹城中女子姿妖娆*
你得卖把力气，这可是一个金币啊
再加点动作
跳起来
*但求香吻一枚了遗憾，永固城的姑娘俺的爱*
（憋死我了，只能翻成这样了）
没想到你这个胖老头还真有两下子
这钱大爷赏你了
真是位慷慨的人啊
嘿，要着陆了吗，这是哪儿啊？
安昂，为什么咱们现在在往下降啊？
是吗？我都没注意到
-现在该注意到了吧？
-出什么事了？
说出来你们可能不相信
不过...我想这沼泽...正在召唤我
它没告诉你在哪儿能找到吃的？
没，我...我猜它想让咱们在这儿着陆
搞笑呢吧，我咋没看到这沼泽上哪儿能着陆啊
我不知道...不过布米告诉我在学习
御土术时要学会等待和倾听
现在大地正在召唤我呢
你不会想让我对这种感觉置之不理吧
-没错
-我也不知道为什么...总觉得这地方有点怪怪的
看吧，就连阿柏和模模也不喜欢这里
好吧，既然大家都强烈反对
那就再见了沼泽
驾，驾
你最好快“牛”加鞭
咱们得赶紧飞
阿柏和模模到哪去了？
阿柏！模模！
-索卡，有个“胳膊水蛭”在你身上
-在哪？在哪？
还能在哪？
为什么总有东西来纠缠我？
-没找到他们吗？
-没有，刚才那个龙卷风也不见了
我们得赶紧离开这儿
也许，咱们应该对这个沼泽客气点
安昂，这些不过是植物而已
你不是想让我在披荆斩棘时对他们点头哈腰吧
也许你该听安昂的
我感觉这个地方好像都是...有生命的
废话，我敢保证这儿的很多东西都是活的
如果不想被他们缠起来吃掉
咱们得尽快找到阿柏
阿柏！模模！
看来它们听不见咱们
咱们也看不见它们
看来得生个篝火在这儿过夜了
-那是什么？
-没啥，沼气罢了
看吧，这儿压根就没什么稀奇古怪的
我想咱们应该生个火
索卡，考虑到咱们可能还要在这儿待上很久
你最好不要那么做
没关系，我问过沼泽了，他说没事的，对吧，沼泽
当然没问题了，索卡
我总感觉好像有什么东西在盯着咱们
拜托，这儿除了咱们哪还有别人
好像还有它们
没错，还有它们
伙计们
我说“飕”，这能是啥动物留下的痕迹哩？
（Tho，音sou，本字幕译为“飕”）
不晓得，“颩”，好像有六条腿，个头也不小哩
（Due，音diu，本字幕译为“颩”）
-脚印很清晰，要追上它很容易
-想去看看是啥东西吗？
“晚餐”呗
（猴假牛威）
安昂！！！
索卡！！！
嘿，你好
能帮帮我吗？
妈妈
妈妈！
真是难以置信
安昂
烂沼泽，全是破藤蔓
卡塔拉
小样的，认为自己很牛是不？
谁在那儿？
月？
不可能，肯定是我沼气吸多了
也许是昨晚跑的时候把脑袋撞的
我肯定是疯了
你没能保护我
卡塔拉！
阿柏！
你好？你是谁啊？
嘿，别跑啊
看哪，飕，驾驭那个大家伙的居然是个小毛兽
才不是，那小东西是狐猴，
我曾经在个“动物世界”中看过，据说很聪明呢
-它的肉肯定吃起来象负鼠鸡
-你就知道负鼠鸡
来呀，伙计们，再靠近点
别着急，慢慢来
别担心，我们只是想吃你们
-你刚才说的都是啥呀？
-大实话啊
-那你也不用告诉它们啊
-我哪知道它们能听懂啊
快追
你是谁啊？
你们俩都疯到哪去了？
为了找你们我这儿都跑遍了
我还不是在到处找你们呢
-我在追一个女孩
-什么女孩？
我也不知道，我先听到有人在笑
寻声看过去是个穿漂亮裙子的女孩
看来这儿附近一定有个品茶会
只不过没人邀请咱们
我好像见到了妈妈
我想咱们只是又怕又饿
脑袋就开始胡思乱想了
于是乎咱们都产生了幻觉
你也看到什么了吗？
我好像见到了月
不过这不能说明什么
可能是因为我一直都在想着她
而你看到妈妈，也是一样原因
那我该怎么解释，那个女孩我之前都没见过
那些幻象都指引我们来这儿
不过这儿是哪啊？沼泽的中心
没错，正中心
这儿是沼泽的心脏，是它召唤我们来这儿的
我就说嘛
只是个破树罢了，它哪会什么召唤
到头来，根本就没有东西在追咱们
这儿也没什么神秘的事发生
真不知道狐猴带着衣服做啥用
那里面有个人，是他用御术操控着藤蔓
如果你是想杀我们
干嘛还要费劲召唤我们到这儿
且慢
我并没有召唤你们来这儿
当我们飞过此地时，听见有人在召唤我
它想让我着陆
他是降世神通，经常有这样诡异的事在我们周围发生
是降世神通啊！
请跟我来
那么你到底是谁？
我一直都在保护这片沼泽不受人类的破坏
特别是那种拿着长刀的人类
看吧，一切都是合理的
根本就没什么怪兽
这儿只有一个保护家园的普通人而已
根本就没什么神秘的
哦，这片沼泽确实一片神奇的地方
而且十分神圣
我在这棵百年大树下得到了启示
就像你说的一样，我感觉有人在召唤我
那可不嘛，是不是跟唠家常似的
实际上整片沼泽就是一个绵延数里的大树
树干向外扩散，扎根
然后接着向外扩散
这是一个巨大的生命体系
就像是个一个浓缩的世界
你说树大，这我可以理解
可你说这就像整个世界？
没错，你觉得你和我，
和你的朋友，和这棵树有什么不同吗？
如果你仔细倾听的话，
你能听到所有生命都在呼吸
你能感受到万物在生长
尽管许多人都不这么想，其实我们是生活在一起的
我们同根同源，都是同一棵树上伸展出的树干
那我们看到的那些幻象又有什么含义呢
在这片沼泽中，我们可以看到我们失去的、
挚爱的人，我们以为他们已经消逝了
但沼泽告诉我们他们依然存在
我们仍和他们有着某种联系
时间是一种幻象，死亡也是一样
那我看到的该怎么解释呢？
那个人我从来都没有见过
你可是降世神通，不妨自己解答吧
时间是个幻象，这么说她是我将要遇到的人
真不想打断你们，不过我们还得找到阿柏和模模
我想我知道该怎么找到他们了
万物都是相连的
快点，咱们得抓紧
*布好鱼线在河岸上，钓到十条我都吃掉*
*切丝切条切成块，鱼头没味我丢水中*
阿柏
我们遭到攻击了
-嘿，你们是御水师啊
-你也是？
看来咱们是亲戚啊
嘿，“休”，过的怎么样？
没啥特别的，就是成天舞舞藤蔓，吓吓人罢了
“休”
觉得负鼠鸡好吃吗？
跟北极的老母鸡一个味
你们干嘛那么想吃阿柏啊？
你们这儿有那么多大块头的动物可以吃
你不是想让我吃老“苗条”吧
我们可是一家人哩
乖“苗条”
哦，他可不吃虫子，那可是给人吃的
你们是从哪来的？
南极
居然还有其他地方有御水师哩
你们那儿的沼泽应该不错吧
没有沼泽，只有冰和雪
嗯，怪不得你们要离开呢
明白了吧，这儿压根就没什么奇怪的东西
就是一群住在沼泽里的埋汰人罢了
那幻象该怎么解释呢
不跟你说过了吗，我们饿了
你看，我饿的连大虫子都吃了
别忘了是大树指引我们找到阿柏和模模的
你可是降世神通哩，那不算数
我唯一不明白的是你们怎么用龙卷风把我们吸下来的
我可不会造风，我只能操控植物中的水
那看来就是天气在搞怪了
所以说嘛，这个沼泽根本就没什么神秘的
谁在那儿？

第五回
神通节
你把什么东西放我嘴里了
模模，以后未经允许，不准擅闯我的领地
投降吧，你们已经被完全包围了
快点，快点，快点
我的天书卷轴
我的滑翼
驾！驾！
等等，我的飞去飞来
没时间了
哈，明白了，就有空去拿你们的卷轴和滑翼
-却没空拿我的飞去飞来？
-没错啊
噢~
索卡，抱歉没能拿回你的飞去飞来
我失去了有别于他人的特质
就像你失去了头上的箭头
就像卡塔拉丢失了她的...
...发圈
这是你们要的东西，马尾男
我曾经是“飞去飞来男”来着
嘿，是水族币啊
在这儿能用吧
是钱就没问题
神通节快乐啊！
神通节？
你们几个是去参加集会的吧？
竟然有个以神通命名的节日
我居然都不知道
看哪！他们做了个巨大的虚子像
后面还有罗库大师哩
办巨大的盛典以表示尊重
这主意太棒了，说实话
倍受欢迎的感觉真是太好了
这集市上的卤炸食品也是相当好吃啊
安昂，看哪
我从没看过这么大号的我
火炬，作武器应该不错，看起来够醒目，够危险
而且很有男人味，不过这东西坚持不了多久
嘿，那个男的想干嘛？
干掉神通！干掉神通！干掉神通！
这些东西你是从哪弄来的？
从哪来的有什么关系
干掉神通！干掉神通！干掉神通！
嘿，那个人想毁掉神通节
（party-pooper:指社交聚会上令人扫兴
的人或者煞风景的人）
不许你们说我的朋友
他是真的神通
他肯定要用可怕的神通功夫灭了咱们
我不会的，我...
你还是离开吧，神通，这儿不欢迎你
为啥这么对他？
安昂一直都在帮助黎民百姓
别害怕，我是站在你们一边的
你可真能信口开河
你的前世做的那些好事我们可是不会忘记的
虚子神通
谋杀了我们的领袖，伟大的秦君
你说我...曾经谋杀过人？
我们的领袖在世时，这儿曾强盛一时
看我们现在都变成啥样了
安昂不会做出那种事的
其他神通也都不会那么做的
你们怎能这样诋毁神通的声誉？
就让她看看我们眼中神通的声誉
给我个机会让我洗脱罪名吧
唯一能够证明你无辜的做法，就是接受审判
荣幸之至
你得遵从我们这儿的所有条令，包括赔付保释金
没问题
我怎么知道他们不收水族的货币
不就是有人不喜欢你嘛
有什么大不了
整个火宗的人不是都恨你入骨吗
干脆让我们把你劫出去得了
我不能那么做
你行的，你不是一般人
就那么咻~咻~咻~
再使招御气术
之后咱们就可以继续赶路了
我想那位“咻咻咻”先生是想说
你应该出去拯救世界
而不是被锁在这里无所事事
就这样逃了，我岂不是要背负杀人犯的罪名
我需要你们搜集证据，为我洗刷冤屈
我们又能做啥？那个谋杀案都是年前的事了
索卡，你能行，你更不是一般人
你可是个刑侦专家啊
没错，这种小案对你来说简直是手到擒来
是啊，在老家时他曾因破过“牛肉干案”而名噪一时
人人都认为是极地豹偷走的，还是我看出了破绽
是个叫杰科的老头...
他穿着极地豹靴做的案
那个足有磅重的极地豹
留下的足印怎么能那么浅呢
没错啦，我真是破案奇才
这么说你会帮我翻案喽
没问题，我得去准备一些新的装备
我准备好了
笑啥？
这就是案发现场
这个脚印就是凶手留下的
那是距今年前的一个黄昏时分
虚子从庙中出来，杀死了伟大的秦君
那场惨剧之后，我们建立了这座塑像
以寄托我们对领袖的哀思，请随便欣赏吧
这座庙和塑像是用同一块石头雕凿而成的
而这塑像是秦死后才建起来的
如果说二者是同时建起来的话，这就是说...
嘘，我正在推理呢
这就是说虚子从未踏足过那个庙
镇长的故事中有很大的破绽
但是并不足以证明安昂的清白
你说的没错
我们得去虚子岛调查调查
那东西你从哪搞的？
你是光头吧
身上还有纹身
看来这儿还真的很适合你
小安安去哪了？
可可，他没法来这儿
-噢
-我要见小安安嘛
岛主，安昂入狱了
秦镇的人说他的前世谋杀了他们的领袖
而那个前世就是虚子
虚子？竟瞎扯！
我带你们去她的祠堂吧
没准在那能找到澄清罪名的证据
那个，请问...苏琪还好吗？她在吗？
实际上，她和其他武士都离岛去参战了
你们对苏琪的影响很大
她说你激励了她，她想帮忙去改变这个世界
噢，是吗...那很好啊
虚子的祠堂是由一座庙改建的
牧师告诉我们从这些圣物中
仍然能感受到她的存在
这是她的和服
真是精致啊
请别上手
这两把扇子...是她的武器吗？
扇子也不许摸
这双是她的靴子？她的脚肯定很大吧
她的脚是历任神通中最大的
等等...大脚？
足印却很小...不可能啊...
啊咳，别没大没小的，在大侦探前你也想班门弄斧？
您说的对，我错了，请说
啊哈，那脚印不可能是虚子留下的
因此并没有证据证明她去过犯罪现场
聪明啊，索卡
你说的那个姑娘，她会明白的
你只管追她就是了
这样行吗？
-当然了！
-没错
你相当出色了
我不知道...
嘿！瞧你英俊潇洒、风流倜傥的
再说了，你可是降世神通
能认识你们真好
不要害怕告诉她你的感受
这幅图名叫“拓创虚子岛”
（画中文字：降世神通虚子今日拓创虚子岛，愿
吾民文化永绝于世界暴政）
图中所画的是虚子岛建立那天日出时的景象
实际上也就是年前的今天
年前？且慢，你确定是今天？
这就是“虚子日”的来由啦，我当然确定
这个仪式好像不是在日出时举行的
好像是在日落，看看这影子就知道了
他们向东指，这说明太阳肯定在西面
那又怎样？
如果虚子当时在日落的仪式上
那秦被杀时，她肯定不在场喽
她有不在场证明
尊敬的镇长，我们准备好了，可以为神通辩护
我们做了调查，发现了十分确凿的证据
证据？笑话！我们这儿可不兴那套
那我该怎么为自己澄清呢？
很简单，我说说事情的经过，然后再让你说说
最后我们决定谁说的正确
这就是我们说的公正
就是公家说的算，哈哈哈
（justice与 just us谐音，
原文应为公正就是只有我们&lt;说的算&gt;）
伟大的秦王赢得了众人的爱戴
而神通却突然出现并杀了他，这就是事情的经过
现在由被告陈词
你能行的，安昂，记住证据就行了
没错...证据
各位小姐先生们，我来告诉你们真正发生了什么
我会以事实来佐证
事实一...
脚印
哦，知道了，你们看，你们看，我的脚很大
另外，你们的...庙与塑像吻合
但是...日落时，我在画中
你们明白了吧，我是无辜的
他死定了
你可是真没少买啊
不过钱你是从哪搞的？
那个新壶你喜欢吗？
说实话
只要是好茶，无论是用瓷壶
还是用铁皮壶煮出来都一样香
我知道咱们最近过得很苦
但是坚持就是胜利
没什么可羞愧的
咱们穷得很有尊严
只有抓住降世神通才能找回我的尊严
祖寇
即便是你抓住了神通
也不见得就能够解决问题
时机未到
根本就没有什么希望了
不会的，祖寇，不要向绝望屈服
不要屈从于自己最低贱的本能
你不该就这么堕落下去
现在是最艰难的时候，你需要给自己希望
要保持住坚强的信念
唐镇长，我希望法庭能允许我做最后的陈词
我已经跟你说过了，只能有我和被告
不能找其他证人
来的并不是别人，我要传叫的是
虚子神通本人
你这是在干嘛？
那个，她不是安昂的前世吗
让他穿上虚子的饰物，没准能触发什么回忆
我可信不着那些饰物
居然胆敢藐视秦镇的法律
拜托，劳烦你再等一会
虚子一定会到场的
嘿，大家好，我是虚子神通
这真是太荒唐了
因谋杀伟大的秦君，法庭将...
是我杀了秦
他是一个可怕的暴君
秦在这片大陆上四处征讨
终有一日他的铁蹄踏到了我们居住的半岛
他要我们立刻弃械投降
我警告他我们不会坐以待毙的
不会让他夺走我们的家园
但是他仍不撤退
就在那天，我们和大陆分离了
我拓建了虚子岛，以使我的子民能够远离入侵者的铁蹄
嗯...发生什么事了？
呃，你刚刚服罪了，抱歉
现在判你有罪，惩罚之轮伺候
皇叔，你说的话我仔细考虑了一下
真的吗，很好，很好
你让我意识到一些事情，道不同不相为谋
咱们还是分道扬镳吧
等等
现在被告旋转轮盘
轮盘停止后指针指向的便是你要受的刑罚
我说过我会接受惩罚的，我不反悔
严刑拷打
拖去喂熊
利剑坑
社区服务！拜托停在社区服务上吧
看来是“油煎之刑”
即日起，该镇归烈火王管辖
把你们管事的给我交出来，好让我...
让我废了他
（dethrone：废黜）
他就在那儿呢
我说神通，别傻看着啊
这个，我到是愿意帮忙，不过我应该接受油煎之刑
看着没，你的刑罚是社区服务
赶紧给社区做点实事吧...
顺便把这些犀牛给我打跑
犀牛帮的兄弟，进攻
我的飞去飞来！就知道你舍不得我
从今以后，我们庆祝新的神通节
以感激安昂神通对我们的保护
他让我们免受犀牛帮的侵略
这是什么？
这是新的节日食物：免炸浆糊饼
吃这个是让大家铭记
神通在今天逃过了油煎之灾
大家神通节快乐
咱们去过的村镇里，这个最烂了

水善国
土强国
火烈国
气和国
很久以前，这四大国和谐共处
然而，烈火国发起的战争结束了和平
只有同时掌握四种元素的降世神通才能结束战争
然而在大家最需要他的时候，他却消失了
年后，我和哥哥发现了转世的降世神通，
他是个御气师，名叫“安昂”
尽管他的御气术着实厉害
在拯救苍生之前，他要学的还有很多
但是我坚信
安昂 能拯救这个世界
-=降世神通=-
最后的气宗

降世神通 前情提要
我们得找到布米王
安昂才能无后顾之忧的学习御土术
这么说你们是要去奥玛舒喽
我向各位介绍土强国城池奥...噢，糟糕
看来我得找别人来教我御土术了
你要找的师傅定要懂得，
在攻击之前审时度势，善于聆听
在这片沼泽中，能看到我们失去的、
挚爱的人的幻象
那我的幻象该怎么解释呢
那个人我从来都没见过
第二卷
土
第六回
盲匪
是很贵没错，但是我真的很喜欢
那就买呗，你也该背个像样的东西了
是吗，你说真的？
还是不行，太贵了，我不该买
好吧，那就别买
管他呢，我这就去买
嘿，孩子们想学御土术吗？
想体验扔石头的快感吗？
快来余师傅御土术武馆吧，包你爽
看，这后面是个招待券
可以免费听第一堂课
说不准，这个余师傅
就是你正在寻找的御土术师傅呢
摆好姿势
现在
以击穿对手头骨之力出拳
怎样，是不是迫不及待要上下一节了？
如果你一次性的交齐全年学费
就让你直接晋下一级
他不是我要找的人
这届“六震土”，“大块石”定会赢回冠军腰带的

哪有那么简单，参加的人可都是世界级的高手
更何况他还要过擂主那关
打搅一下，请问御土术锦标赛在哪儿进行啊？
在那个“关你啥岛”来着？
“关你屁事”岛
噢，这笑话太经典了
让我去问问看吧
嘿，猛男们，慢走啊
真不明白我是咋想的
干嘛要买个新包呢
你们干嘛不拦着我？
准备好去拜师了吗？
咱们这就去“六震土”瞧瞧
你是怎么做到的？
哦，女孩的魅力呗
嘿，还是前排座位呢
真不明白怎么会没人坐在这儿
现在你知道原因了吧
欢迎大家来到“六震土”
在下辛富，担任本场主持
真不明白，几个莽夫互相扔石头有什么好看的
不好看的话，我干嘛会花钱来这儿
规则很简单，只要把对手击出场地就算胜利
第一轮，“大块石”对阵“巨坏河马”
听者，河马，说你“巨”倒是没错
不过“坏”你还不够格
要赢你，我只要使招“山崩”就行了
河马很生气，后果很严重
太精彩了，女士们先生们
河马居然撼动了“大块石”
胜者是“大块石”
你看这个“大块石”咋样？
看起来身手不错
不知道，布米说我需要的人得善于聆听土地
他只是徒有肌肉罢了
索卡你觉得呢？
下一场
“大块石”对战“火宗男”
全场起立合唱烈火国赞歌吧
烈火王啊，我的生命为你燃烧
滚回烈火国去
不要啊，好汉饶命啊！
“大块石”太炫了，小样的还敢和人家支把~
现在，万众期待的时刻到了
“大块石”将对战卫冕擂主...“盲匪”
她该不是真盲吧，是配合角色扮的吧？
依我看，她应该是
依我看，她应该是...输定了
“大块石”内心充满了矛盾
他怎忍心欺负一个失明的小丫头
“大块石”，你该不是害怕了吧
“大块石”心中不再矛盾
（真讨厌，说自己老用第三人称）
一招泰山压顶就要了你的小命
准备好就放马过来吧，小卵石
接招！
今天获胜者仍是“盲匪”
擂主卫冕成功！
怎么可能！
她是怎么做到的？
审时度势，善于聆听
为了让今晚的比试更加有趣
只要是赢了“盲匪”
我将奖给他一袋金币
怎么？没人敢来应战吗？
我来！
加油安昂，为“大块石”报仇
大家肯定没兴趣看咱们两个小姑娘对打吧
我不想和你过招，只是想跟你谈谈
少废话，快打
别嘘安昂
脚下功夫真轻啊，敢问阁下绰号为何？
“妙舞者”？
去哪了？
且慢！
在这儿呢
请听我说
我需要一个御土术师傅，只有你能胜任
管你是谁，别来烦我
等等
好样的，擂主
我得承认，这个包真的没买错
和这腰带简直就是绝配
您老终于满意了
如果我们要找“盲匪”
最好从御土术武馆开始着手
太衰了，咋又是你
咋的，不想见我？
果然牛
嘿，你不就是那个战胜“盲匪”的孩子吗？
我们有事要找她，你们知道她住哪儿吗？
那个盲匪很神秘的，总是神龙见首不见尾
让我来问吧
赶快从实招来
是真的，知道的我都讲了
没人知道她去哪儿了，更别提她是谁了
咱们可能找错人了
在幻象中，那是个穿白裙的女孩
还有个飞天野猪为伴
你们认识相似的人吗？
那个，飞天野猪是北方家族的族徽
他们是镇上的首富，没准也是全球首富呢
不过没听说他们有个女儿
知道这些就足够了，我们去看看吧
是啊，快滚吧
嘿，我可是盯上你们了
水族帮
是真的，“大块石”当时就站在那儿
正好看到那小孩出手
他没用任何御土术，压根就没有身体接触
“盲匪”就跌出场外了
他俩肯定合起伙来坑你的钱
竟然敢骗我辛富
那就是我在幻象中看到的
飞天野猪，咱们走
你来这儿干嘛，“亮脚趾”
（twinkle:闪耀，更有快速地移动之意，
该昵称应取后者意，期待更好的翻译）
你怎么知道是我？
叫什么“亮脚趾”，一点男子气也没有
那个买包来配腰带的又是谁啊
你们是怎么找到我的？
一个疯国王让我拜善于聆听土地的御土师为师
在个神奇的沼泽中好看到了个幻象...
安昂是想告诉你，他是降世神通
他必须尽快找到一个御土术师傅，助他战败烈火王
跟我有何关系
赶紧滚出去，否则我叫警卫了
要赢得这场战争，我们需要你的帮助
你的任务就是教安昂御土术
警卫，快来，救命啊
拓芙小姐，咋了？
我好像听到了什么，我好害怕啊
你父亲不想让你在没有监护的情况下独自游逛
听说拓芙在你的单独辅导下进展神速啊
不过千万不要让她尝试任何危险的招式
您放心，我一直都在传授她御术的基础招式
以及调息训练，仅此而已
那很好
老爷，有客来访
什么重要人物啊，也不通报一声就来了
是降世神通，老爷
帮她吹吹，太烫了
让我来吧
安昂神通，您的到访让寒舍蓬荜生辉啊
依您看，这场战争何时能结束？
我计划在夏末之前战败烈火王
但是我必须先找到一位御土术师傅来教我
余师傅当然是不二人选
拓芙自幼就师从于他
这么说拓芙的御土术应该很棒了
教个徒弟应该不成问题吧
拓芙仍在修炼基础招式
没错，只因她自幼失明
我不指望她能成为一代宗师
噢，她可比您想象的要厉害的多
你是什么意思啊？
那你又是什么意思啊？
不如咱们去起居室吃甜点吧
晚安，伙计
别紧张，晚饭的事我很抱歉，咱们休战吧，行吗？
虽然我双目失明，可没有影响我的“视觉”
御土术就是我的眼睛，我可用双脚感知万物
通过大地的震动，我能分辨物体的方位
包括你，树木，就连那些蚂蚁也不能逃过我的“双眼”
真是不可思议
可我的父母却不了解，他们认为我是个废人
所以你才变成了盲匪
没错
既然不快乐，为何还要留在这里
我的父母在这儿，我还能去哪里？
跟我们一起走吧
是啊，你们可以浪迹天涯
自由自在，无忧无虑，那才是生活
而那些都不属于我
我们被埋伏了
把欠我的钱给我吐出来
有人抓走了安昂和拓芙，留下了这张字条
想要回你们的女儿，速携金币来竞技场
署名为：“大块石”和辛富
真不敢相信
我得到了&quot;大块石&quot;的亲笔签名
余师傅，我希望你能帮忙救我女儿回来
我们跟你一块去
可怜的拓芙，她肯定害怕极了
你为你很强吗？
有种你就上来，看爷不把你那笑脸给撕了的
我没笑啊~
拓芙
这是你们要的钱，赶快放了他们
那安昂呢？
相信烈火国会给个更合理的价钱
现在，从我的场子滚出去
走吧，我不会有事的
拓芙，他们人多势众
我们需要个御土师帮忙，我们需要你
我女儿可是个盲人
她又盲又小，又虚又弱, 她可帮不了你们
不，我可以
放了他，一群手下败将
还敢跟我张牙舞爪的
&quot;大块石&quot;觉得此言差矣
且慢
他们归我了
再用点力
少废话
我真是有眼无珠
令千金竟如此厉害
她是我见过的最强的御土师
老爸，我知道你很难接受这样的我
我不是你想象中的那个唯唯诺诺、又弱又盲得小姑娘
我喜欢搏斗，我以自己是御土师为傲
习武这方面我真的真的很在行
向您隐藏了我的生活，我很抱歉
而你们可对我隐藏了整个世界
我知道你们是为了保护我
但是我已经岁了，却没有一个真正的朋友
现在你已经了解真正的我了
我希望您能改变对我的看法
拓芙，那番话的确改变了我对你的看法
让我意识到了一些事情
真的吗？
没错，我之前给你太多的自由了
从今以后，我将派人对你全天候的看护
可是老爸~
拓芙，我们这么做都是为了你好
来人哪，送客，把神通和他的朋友请出去
这儿不再欢迎他们了
我很遗憾，拓芙
我也很遗憾，再见了，安昂
别担心，找个师傅还不容易
杰出的御土师随处可见
可是没人可以像她那样
拓芙，你怎么来了？
老爸回心转意了
他给了我自由，让我去游历世界
那咱们最好赶快离开这儿
免得他老人家改主意
说的对
拓芙，你将会是个杰出的师傅
话说回来，我正好有个东西要给你看
好啊
现在咱们扯平了
呃，把腰带还我
抱歉
我知道你们不是一类人
但我相信你们都会对这个感兴趣
降世神通绑架了我的女儿
我要你们把她给我带回家来
不惜一切代价

请恕罪，父皇，我只是一心为烈火国的利益着想
你该学会尊重，而痛苦将是的老师
道不同不相为谋
咱们还是分道扬镳吧
你就像我的妹妹一样
父皇说她是生来幸运
而我能降生到这世上，就已经是我的幸运了
我不需要什么幸运
那些挣扎和抗争能让我变得坚强
成就了今天的我

第七回
祖寇单飞
拜托，来个“豹子”
（原文spider snake eyes 蛛蛇眼？）
我想要点水，一包饲料，再来碗热汤面
你的钱不够，只够买两包饲料
嘿，是你朝我们扔的鸡蛋吗？
没有
看到是谁干的吗？
没有
你不是只会说“没有”吧
鸡蛋总不能凭空出现吧
没准正好有只鸡飞过
感谢你的捐赠
军队对你的贡献将不胜感激
你最好离开这村镇
对肆意逗留的人的刑罚
你小子可吃不消
相信我没错的
当兵的理应保护我们远离火宗的侵害
而他们只是群披着兵衣的地痞无赖罢了
多谢你刚才罩着我
不如来我家吧，顺便帮你喂一下鸵鸟马
来嘛，就当我报答你的
一般人我都不带他来这儿
谢谢啊
你是李的朋友吗？
他不仅敢直面那些兵痞
更厉害的是，他还把他们给吓走了
敢问壮士尊姓大名啊
我叫...呃...
塞拉，不要对人家刨根问底
只要是敢和恃强凌弱的兵痞对抗的人
都是我们的朋友
那些兵简直就是土强国的耻辱
真正士兵都去参战了，就像李的大哥苏森一样
晚饭就快做好了，留下来吃吧
不了，我还要赶路
正好苏干修谷仓需要帮手，劳烦你搭把手
一会儿咱们就开饭
你看起来好像不是本地人啊
你打哪儿来啊？
从来处来
哦，那要去哪儿呢？
李，别烦人家了
打听别人的隐私是很不礼貌的
好的
对了，你脸上的疤咋弄得
追问别人不愿意回答的问题可不礼貌啊
别人有权对自己的过去保持沉默
嘿，额娘，想看看阿祖拉是怎么喂龟鸭的吗？
祖寇，你干嘛那么做？
蠢龟鸭，它干嘛要那样？
祖寇，天下的母亲都是一样的
如果有人也这样欺负你的话
我也会上去咬他的
阿祖拉
看我的，额娘，能让祖寇跟我们一起玩吗？
我们正好三缺一
-我可不想当什么车轱辘
-谁让你当了，再说车轱辘又不是什么游戏，笨笨
我不管
我不想跟你玩
你们可是兄妹，应该时常聚在一起
我说的对吧，额娘
没错，亲爱的，和你妹妹玩是个好主意
去吧，就玩一会儿
咱们这么玩，要设法把其他人头上的苹果打掉
就像这样
看吧，我就说会奏效吧
噢，他们在一起好般配啊
你们两个真是...呃
我正到处找你们呢
你们的艾洛皇叔从前线发了封信回来
你怎么浑身都湿透了
那帮丫头都疯了
如果永固城象它的城墙一样宏伟
那我倒是应该去见识见识
希望你们也能来瞧瞧
希望那时我没将它夷为平地
就写到这儿吧
希望礼物你们能喜欢
给祖寇的是把珍珠匕首
是在攻破外城时从一名将军那儿缴获的
这匕首做工不错
注意看上面的刻字
非战不屈
给阿祖拉介绍个新朋友
她穿着的可是土强国最流行的时装哦
如果皇叔战死沙场的话
阿玛应该就会继任成为烈火国的国君吧？
阿祖拉，怎么能那么说话
艾洛皇叔要是回不来该多糟啊
更何况，烈火王阿祖龙身体康健
如果路腾堂兄期盼阿玛死去，你能好受吗？
我还是觉得阿玛会是更好的烈火王人选
比那个只爱喝贡茶的家伙强多了
拿刀的姿势完全错了
记住，这把叫雌雄刀
两部分合而化一
别以为它们是分开的，他们可是个整体
只是一种武器的两个部分而已
你就像我的大哥苏森
他以前经常耍功夫给我看
拿着吧，够在路上吃几顿的
他们想来干什么？
找麻烦
高，你们来干什么？
觉得总该有人来捎个话，你儿子的军队被俘了
知道火宗人是怎么对待上一批战俘的吗？
缴了械，让他们穿上火宗的军服
然后把他们推上前线
看着他们自相残杀
你给我闭嘴
你干嘛和这些睡在泥里的猪混在一起
艾洛失去了他的儿子，你的路腾堂兄战死了
我哥哥会怎么样？
我得去前线看看，找到森苏，把他带回来
我老爸不在的时候，你会留下来吗？
不了，我要继续赶路
这刀给你，收下吧
念念上面的字
土强国制造
是另一面
非战不屈
浪费时间玩那个刀有什么用
再怎么练也是那德行
不信你就拿个苹果放在头上
我让你看看我有多强
顺便说一句
皇叔回来了
这么说我们打赢了？
没
那意味着皇叔是个逃兵，是个废物
你瞎说些什么？
皇叔可不是逃兵
他就是，他儿子死后他就一蹶不振
真正的将军应该留在战场
将永固城夷为平地
而不是吃了败仗就跑回家哭
你都知道些什么？
从此要与他的独子从此阴阳两隔，他可能过于悲伤了
你们阿玛要带你们去见烈火王阿祖龙
穿上朝服，快点
烈火王阿祖龙？
干嘛不直接叫皇祖父
他已经廉颇老矣
不久之后就会让位给别人了
小姑娘，管好你的嘴
真不知道这孩子到底是怎么了？
你们的曾祖父孙进是如何赢得“寒腿之战”（音译）的？
曾祖父能战胜，是因为...
是因为尽管敌众我寡，他仍能观察到我方的优势
敌方处于下风向，且正值旱季
所以他们瞬间就被烧得灰飞烟灭了
答得好
现在，给我展示一下你新学的招式吧
真是个习武奇才啊
他不光继承了您的名字
更继承了您的才智
你永远也超不过我的
我也想展示一下我新学的招式
我失败了
没有啊，打得不错
这就是你，不管多困难也会坚持奋斗的人
欧宰，干嘛浪费时间让我看这些西洋景
有话就直说吧，其他人退下吧
你到底...
父皇，你可能也意识到了
路腾死后，艾洛已经没有子嗣了
在他儿子战死后，皇兄更放弃了对永固城的进攻
也不知道他什么时候能回来
可是我在这儿，父皇
更有子女绕膝
有话直言
父皇
废黜了艾洛吧
我是您谦卑的奴仆，让我来为您和国家尽忠吧
立我为太子吧
你竟敢背叛你的皇兄
更何况此时他的儿子仍还尸骨未寒
我看艾洛受的苦已经够多了
该是惩戒你的时候了
父亲会杀了你的
真的会
哈哈，阿祖拉，我好怕怕啊
那好，你不用信我
可我什么都听见了
皇祖父说为了让阿玛记住教训
让他也知道知道失去长子的痛苦
也就是牺牲你
胡扯
我跟你说都是为了你好
也许能找到一个善良的土强国家庭收养你
别说了，住嘴
阿玛不会那么做的
傻孩子，你在说什么呢？
发生什么事了？
我不知道
该是时候好好谈谈了
阿祖拉总是撒谎...阿祖拉总是撒谎...
阿祖拉总是撒谎
拜托你帮帮忙，李出事了
苏干刚走那群兵痞就来了
他们命令我们给他们吃的，李拔出把匕首要反抗
我都不知道那刀他是从哪得来的
他们把他带走了，说他够大了
已经到岁数该参军了
我知道咱们萍水相逢，但是...
我会带你儿子回来的
嘿！他来了！我就说他会来的
放了那个孩子
你算老几啊？敢命令我们
我是谁并不重要，不过我知道你们是谁
你们根本不是什么士兵
只是一群无赖
路霸，恃强凌弱
简直连猪狗都不如
你们并不是要征李入伍
你们这帮懦夫只会欺负
这种境遇窘迫的家庭
还在这儿愣着干嘛
就任由这个人辱骂我们？
给他一记左勾拳，左勾拳！
他们又不是在比拳
那就使个左手剑，这总行了吧?
小心
当心后面
额娘
祖寇
祖寇，我的心肝，听我说，我所做的都是为了保护你
记住祖寇，不管世事将如何变化
不要忘记自己是谁
起来啊
你，你是谁？
我是祖寇，娥萨与烈火王欧宰之子
（Ursa:大熊座，这里指祖寇之母，暂译为娥萨）
烈火王的王子，未来王位的继承人
骗子，我听说过你
你不是什么太子，只是个被流放的废人
被自己的父亲烧伤后遗弃
你别再靠近了
这是你的，你留着吧
我不要，我恨你
额娘
额娘
额娘
额娘去哪儿啦？
没人知道，对了，昨晚，皇祖父去世了
别开这种玩笑，阿祖拉，你个疯子
把我的匕首还给我，马上
你又想找谁来求救，额娘吗？
她在哪儿？
烈火王阿祖龙，在位年
您曾是格赛之战中无畏的领袖
收服湖心省的无敌的征服者
您曾是艾洛之父，欧宰之父，埃拉之夫
如今却撒手归西
您曾是陆坦的祖父，祖寇和阿祖拉的祖父，
如今却驾鹤西游
安息吧，尊您遗诏
你的次子将承袭皇位
烈火王欧宰万岁！万岁！万万岁！

倘若想抓住我的猎物，我必须要敏捷而伶俐
我需要一支精锐的小分队
虽然我生来就双目失明，但并没有影响我的“视觉”

拓芙，你会是个很棒的师傅
你说过的话让我想了很多
真的吗？
很好，很好
正所谓道不同不相为谋
咱们还是分道扬镳吧

追逐
嘿，你们选的营地不赖啊
这儿的草怪软的
那可不是草，是阿柏掉的毛
噢，好恶心
并没有什么恶心的，这说明春天已经来了
万物重生，花儿开放
阿柏也会换件新衣裳
啊，春天之美
停下，阿柏，快停下
没那么糟，卡塔拉，这毛做假发很合适
做胡子也不错嘛
真庆幸咱们小组中多了个女孩
你们两个简直太粗俗了
打搅一下，请问你们谁有剃刀啊？
我有一些毛要修理修理
我说，拓芙，一般咱们露营之后
大家都要互相帮忙，分担些工作
嘿，不用担心我，我不需要帮忙
是吗，实际上，我想说的是，呃
大家分工合作
比如有人负责取水，有人负责生火
或者帮忙搭帐篷
就连模模也会帮忙的
卡塔拉，没事的，我可以照顾好自己
我不需要火，我还为自己囤了点吃的，瞧
我的帐篷也都搭好了
啊，不错啊，不过我们仍然需要....
俺咋就不明白呢，你到底想干啥
算了吧
抱歉
嘿，拓芙，我想对之前的事说声抱歉
我想咱们可能太累了
所以都有点小脾气
没错，你看起来累坏了
我是说咱们都累了
好吧，晚安
晚安
有东西冲我们这儿来了
是什么？
感觉像是雪崩
不过又不大像
你的知觉能力真让人毛骨悚然
我们应该离开吗？
为了安全还是离开的好
那是个什么东西？
啊，陆地，亲爱的陆地
早上见了
能帮我们把东西卸下来吗
啥？不是想让我帮忙
卸索卡的那个臭烘烘的睡袋吧？
是啊，没错
还有其他东西要搬
你现在是我们小组的成员了...
我都没要求你们帮我卸行李
行李我都是自己背的
这不是重点
身为组员却自私自利
丝毫没有为人民服务的精神
什么？
听我说
好好小姐，我放弃了荣华富贵，
就为了教安昂御土术
所以别跟我讲什么“自私自利”
好好小姐？
你居然敢跟我摔门
你怎么这么不可理喻呢？
我们应该做点啥吗？
嘿，有好戏看不是挺好吗？
好了，好了，你们都需要冷静冷静
我们俩？我现在很冷静
看...看得出来
今天晚上的星星真漂亮啊
真可惜你都看不到啊，拓芙
你们嚷来嚷去，还搞地震
到底还让不让人睡啊
那东西又来了
是吗？离咱们多远？也许咱们可以再眯一会
索卡，来不及了
说真的，那是个啥东东？
它怎么总能找到咱们
不知道，不过这回咱们得确保甩掉他们
就这么着吧，也别扎帐篷了
找一块软点的土，俺得赶紧睡
也对，反正拓芙也不会帮忙的
哦，我不知道咱这儿还有需要掩被角的婴儿呢
拜托了各位，后有追兵
还不知道是人是兽呢
可能是祖寇，北极之后就再也没见他
谁是祖寇？
就是个梳马尾辫，满世界追踪我们的愤青
马尾男，你说的是哪个马尾男啊？
我这可是战狼尾辫
对哈，这辫子可是你“风趣、大胆”的象征哩
不管是谁在追咱们
他们都不可能到这儿来，所以，现在大家能否...
嘘~~~
不行，模模，嘘！快睡觉
啊，不是吧
这不可能
没道理啊，怎么能知道咱们在这儿
我双脚已经能感觉到他们了
咱们赶快离开这儿
也许咱们应该面对他们
看看他们到底是谁
没准，他们对咱们没有恶意
乐观害死人啊
是奥玛舒城中的那三个女孩
咱们可以收拾他们，三对三
拓芙，实际上咱们有四个人
哦，抱歉，没查你，你啥御术都不会
但我很能打
好吧，三对三，外加索卡
都已经知道他们是谁了，还不赶紧跑
阿柏，驾，驾
真不敢相信，
她们居然从奥玛舒一路跟到这儿
我还是觉得咱们能灭了他们
别开玩笑了
光是那个用蓝御火术的
和飞匕首的两个人就已经够受的了
还有个丫头可以使你完全用不出御术来
真是太恐怖了
哦，不是吧，太阳都出来了
一晚上都没得安生
索卡，咱们会没事的
真的吗？我以前都没缺过觉
我睡着后，要是出事了该怎么办？
要知道总会有事发生的
每次我们一着陆，那些女孩就会出现了
所以咱们还是一直飞吧
我们不能一直飞下去
那咱们该怎么办？
不知道...太累了，脑子都不会转了
咱们打个小盹，肯定能想出好主意
没错
睡觉
咋的了？
阿柏睡着了
快醒醒，伙计
阿柏累坏了
好吧，估计已经把她们甩的没影了
现在的计划就是学阿柏
美美的睡上一觉
当然了，如果当初拓芙能够帮帮大家
咱们肯定早就能睡觉了
什么？
好了，好了，大家都累坏了，赶快休息休息吧
不行，我得让卡塔拉把话说清楚
你觉得是我的问题？
我是就事论事，如果你能帮忙，那营地早就扎好了
觉睡好了，就不会落得这种田地了
怎么都怪到我头上了？
没有，她没有怪你
没错，我是怪她了
嘿，我从来都没麻烦过你们
我一直都自己背行李
再说了，要怪也要怪那个掉毛的家伙
啥？你怪阿柏？
没错，想知道为什么他们总能找到咱们吗？
他到处给人家留线索
你怎么敢责怪阿柏？
它今天救了你三次
要怪也只能怪你自己
你总说是你自己在背行李
说错了，一直都是它在帮你背
阿柏还背着你，只有我们仨的时候
阿柏咋就没成问题呢
走了，伤自尊了
等等
我都作了啥呀？居然跟自己的御土术师傅叫嚣
把她给挤兑走了
我知道
我们都在试着习惯对方
我对她的态度太坏了
没错，你们俩是挺浑的
谢谢啊，索卡
客气啥
我们得找到拓芙，向她道歉
好吧，不过那些追咱们的疯丫头该咋处理？
我有个主意
拓芙说的对，阿柏的毛的确给他们留下了线索
不过他现在干净了，不会再露馅了
他现在能飞了吗？
把咱们的鞍和行李都卸下来，应该没问题
我用阿柏的毛做个假线索
吸引她们的注意力
哦，伤到我的尾巴尖了
这么一大片湿毛
好可爱啊
嗯，它们不成团，也不成束
更不成串，呈种什么态来着？
簇
簇，成簇状
应该是朝这边走了
神通想误导咱们
你们从那个方向走，继续追踪野牛
我倒要看看他葫芦里卖的什么药
拓芙不会走得太远的
怎么了，模模
不好，卡塔拉
她们是怎么找到的
阿柏，快飞，咱们得再快点
他太累了
不好，不好
咱们只要跨过那条河就行
加油啊，阿柏，再飞远一点
我们成功了
安全了
你做到了，阿柏
想法很好，不过没用
你们想干嘛
哎，真是的
我原以为，和泰丽抓到你们时一定会很激动
看来，胜利真无趣
多谢你，阿柏
真不知道没有你该怎么办
刚才那个男生很可爱吧
好吧，你追上我了，你到底是谁，要干嘛？
怎么还没猜到，没觉得我很眼熟吗？
给你个提示
我必须要抓住神通
夺回我的尊严
没事的，尽管笑，是挺好笑的
那你要干嘛
干嘛？
抓你呗，不管你怎么努力，都无处可逃
你可以跑，不过我迟早会抓到你
我不会跑的
这杯茶给你
要独自旅行你的年纪还太小
我还觉得你太老呢
也许是很老了
我知道你怎么想的，我可能看起来照顾不了自己
我可没那么想
你都不敢让我自己倒茶喝
我为你倒茶，是因为我想那么做
没有其他意思
人们看到我，都以为我很软弱
他们想要照顾我，但是我可以照顾好自己
你很象我的侄子
总想独自完成所有事情，希望万事不求人
让爱你的人帮助你没有什么不对的
不是想说我爱你哟，毕竟咱们才刚见面
那你的侄子到哪去了？
实际上我一直在跟踪他
他走丢了吗？
算是吧
他的生活最近发生了很大变故
现在正值困难时期
他想找回自我
所以他离开了
所以你一直跟着他
我知道他现在不想我出现在身边
但是当他需要我的时候
我会在他左右的
你的侄子真幸运
即便他并不知道
谢谢你
我的荣幸，能够与如此出色的年轻人喝茶是件乐事
我是说谢谢你的那番话
令我茅塞顿开
荣幸之至
哦，下回见到你侄子时
也许应该告诉他你也需要他
你真的想跟我打吗？
是的，那当然
祖寇
我还在想你啥时会出现呢，祖祖
祖祖？
退后，阿祖拉，他是我的
我哪也不会去的
卡塔拉
皇叔
快起来
我想你们可能需要帮助
多谢
看看哪，敌人和叛徒协同作战了
我认输，我知道胜不了你们
我投降了
君子报仇，十年不晚
离我们远点
祖寇，让我来帮忙吧
走开！

水善国
土强国
火烈国
气和国
很久以前，这四大国和谐共处
然而，烈火国发起的战争结束了和平
只有同时掌握四种元素的降世神通才能结束战争
然而在大家最需要他的时候，他却消失了
年后，我和哥哥发现了转世的降世神通，
他是个御气师，名叫“安昂”
尽管他的御气术着实厉害
在拯救苍生之前，他要学的还有很多
但是我坚信
安昂 能拯救这个世界
-=降世神通=-
最后的气宗

降世神通 前情提要
虽然我生来就双目失明，但并没有影响我的“视觉”
御土术就是我的眼睛
听我说，好好小姐，我放弃了荣华富贵，
就为了教安昂御土术
看看哪，敌人和叛徒已经建立统一战线了
第二卷
土
第九回
埋头苦练
终于盼到今天了
你能相信吗？
经过那番寻师之旅后
我终于可以开始学习御土术了
看看这儿，简直就是天然的练功场，不是吗？
索卡？
哦，你还没醒呢啊
抱歉啊~
早啊，我的御土术徒儿
早安，拓芙师傅
嘿，你都没叫过我师傅哩
好吧，我会改口的
抱歉了，小懒虫，我们在用御土术时会尽量安静的
那你会先教我哪招呢？
“石破天惊”？“石震八方”？
哦，干脆教我在地上造个大漩涡吧
我们先从移动岩石开始吧
太好了，太好了
站姿正确是使用御土术的诀窍
下盘要稳而有力
岩石是一种坚硬的元素
想要学会移动岩石，就必须要像岩石一样
坚如磐石，明白了
不错，实际上所用的招式十分简单
好的，准备好了吗，来试试吧
我准备好了
本轮御气师败北，岩石胜出
老爸，我逮到你了
路腾，我的儿子，黄泉路上我们再见
皇叔，你刚才昏过去了
都是阿祖拉干的好事
居然偷袭你
料到了，没啥稀奇的
希望我泡的茶你能喜欢
不错
真是非常...呃...提神啊
皇叔，我一直在想
我们迟早还会与阿祖拉遭遇
只有掌握些更高级的御火招数，我才有赢她的胜算
我知道你可能会说：
她是我的皇妹，我应该尽量与她为善
怎么会，是该有人出来收拾那个疯丫头了
现在开始恢复你的修炼
真不明白错到底出在哪里，他明明做的和你一样嘛
可能还有其他方法，
如果我从其他角度来攻击会不会好一点
答错，这正是你的问题所在
你应该停止从御气师的角度想问题
没有什么角度问题，收起来你那些小聪明、小把戏
那些玩艺没法移动岩石
你需要对它迎面痛击
而我说的“迎面”，就要有这种气势
我之前训练过安昂一段时间
我觉得他更适合那种“正面鼓励式教学法”
给他更多的鼓励和表扬，语气要和蔼
如果他做错了的时候，可以旁敲侧击让他重归正途
谢了，卡塔拉，那招旁敲侧击我会试试的
把膝盖给我太高点，亮脚趾
稳若磐石
稳若磐石
你是很可爱，不过只能怪你点太背
谁让你浑身都是肉呢
再靠近点...
抓到你了
你这个小肉球今天还真走运
闪电本是御火术的一种升华形态
而非进攻招式
与其他御火术不同的是
催动闪电所用的并不是暴怒的情绪
有人称闪电为“冷血烈焰”
这招精准且致命，正如阿祖拉一样
使用该招的关键在于要内心平和
我明白了，所以我们要品茶冥想
为的就是平复心态
是啊，说的好
孺子可教也
我们存在于能量场中，这些能量亦阴亦阳
正负相依
只有少数的御火师能将这些能量分离
那势必会打破能量的平衡
在能量重新平衡之际
正负能量便会相撞，继而合并如初
如果加以释放和引导，就将产生闪电
我已经跃跃欲试了
记住，一旦你分离开能量之后，你要做的不是控制它
而要做个谦卑的引导者
注意调息
这次我们将尝试些不同的项目
不是移动岩石
而是要截住岩石
赶紧给我扎好马步
我将会把那块圆石推下来
学会从御土师的角度看问题
保持站姿，截住岩石
就像这样
抱歉，拓芙，你确定这是教
安昂御土术的最好方法吗？
多谢你的提醒，实际上，有个更好的方法
这样他可以真正通过感知圆石的震动来截住它
谢了，卡塔拉
是啊，我谢你啊，卡塔拉
我想我可能是害怕了，我不知道该怎样解释
还想解释啥？
都让你给搞砸了，原本你的站姿不错
然而当岩石真正滚下来时，你却没胆去截住它
我知道了，我很抱歉
没错，你是该抱歉，连截止块石头的勇气都没有
大不了就是被石头碾成泥呗
就会像个没骨头的懦夫一样跳开
现在，你能不能像个御土师一样直面那个岩石？
算了，我想我不行
安昂，没关系的，不如休息下吧
一会再回来修行御土术
再说了，你还有很多御水术功课没做呢
好吧，是个好主意
哈，随便你吧，去玩玩水没准能感觉好点
为什么我做不到呢？
闪电没弄出，反倒弄了一脸灰
我真是一事无成啊
这正是我一直担心的
如果无法处理好内心的躁动的话
你将无法掌握闪电这招
啥躁动？
祖寇，如果想让你的怒气消失，你必须放下羞耻感
我可没有什么羞耻感
我的内心仍然一如既往的骄傲着
祖寇殿下，骄傲与耻辱并不是对立的
其恰恰是耻辱的根源
谦卑却是羞耻唯一的解药
最近我的人生除了谦卑之外一无所有
我有个主意
让我教你一招新的御火术
这招就连阿祖拉都不会
因为是我自创的
你肯定认为我是自作自受吧
你看，我很抱歉要猎杀你
但这是物竟天择的自然法则啊
大鱼吃小鱼，小鱼吃虾米
不过今天这法则好像不怎么灵验
我承认，你很可爱
好吧，算你厉害
如果我今天能够活着出去
一定会为我的素食情节拨乱反正的
从今以后再不吃肉
即使肉食是那么的美味
看来真是善有善报啊
好吧，我自己拿
飞去飞来，你给我回来
你也知道那障碍对你来说只是暂时的，对吧？
我现在不想谈论它
这正是问题所在，不要逃避
如果你不再逃避，而是直面问题症结...
好了，好了，好了，我知道了，行吗？
我需要学会面对，坚如磐石
但是我就是做不到，我也不知道为什么，我就是不行
安昂，如果说火和水是对立
那与空气对立的又是什么呢？
我想是土吧
这就是你难以掌握它的原因吧
御土术所运用的东西与你的天性相反
但是你一定能想出办法的，我看好你哟
开动脑筋
不错
你已经有御水大师的反应能力了
多谢，卡塔拉
应该叫卡塔拉师傅
火是代表力量的元素
烈火国的人拥有欲望和决心
而这能量可以驱使他们得到想要得一切
土则是一种坚实的元素
土强国的人各色各样，但都十分强壮
他们拥有坚持和忍耐的品性
气是一种自由的元素
气宗的人超凡脱俗，总能找到的和平和自由
还有，他们有着举世无双的幽默感
水是一种富有变化的元素
水宗的人能够随遇而安
他们具有较强的社会责任感和爱心
从而使得他们能够所向披靡
为什么要跟我讲这些
从他人身上汲取智慧是十分有益的
如果只顾闭门造车，将会变得刻板和陈腐
无论是其它元素，还是国家
倘若能够采取他人之长
都将会使你的人生变得完整而圆满
掌握四种元素应该是降世神通的任务吧
正是由于降世神通能够集四种元素于一身
才会拥有如此强大的力量
同样，了解这些，也会使你力量大增
我将要传授给你的技艺
就是从一位御水师那里学来的
安昂，我在你的袋子中找到了这些坚果
你应该不会介意吧，再说了
即便在意，你那么懦弱又能拿我怎么样
事实上，我不介意，我很高兴与大家分享
是嘛，很高兴你能那么想
因为我还从你那淘到一个很好的核桃钳
你最好不要....那可是个古董了
由僧侣们手工制作....是个相当精巧的器物
有什么大不了的，这种东西周围多得是
嘿，安昂，你看见...
没看见我打坐呢？
事关紧要，太阳都快下山了，可是索卡还没回来
我想咱们应该出去找找他
分头去找吧，应该能快点
“报应”啊，不管你是人是神
如果我能够活着出去
我一定戒掉吃肉和挖苦人的坏毛病，行吗？
哦，我就这么点嗜好
原本就靠这些标新立异来着
索卡，肉食讥讽男
我愿意一心向善，做个素食的好好先生
说定了？
安昂！谢天谢地！有没有给我带点肉啊？
索卡，你没事吧
住手，快住手，在这样下去手指头就该被你拔下去了
嗯，那我就使招御气术救你出去吧
说真的，安昂，虽然你刚学御土术
不过没准能管用，试试看？
我不行
我做不到
如果你不能救我出来，就把托芙叫来
那我也办不到
办不到？为啥？
那会感觉非常不自在的
不自在？是啊，我怎么会让你感觉不自在呢？
谢了，索卡
那个破御土术真是愁死我了
我感觉压力巨大，每个人都期望我能速成
反倒让我的处境十分尴尬
处境尴尬？咱们还真是难兄难弟
我试吧，肯定会失败；
可我要是不试，那将永远也学不会
我感觉现在真是进退两难啊
（俗语：between a rock an a hard place）
忘了给你们介绍了
安昂，这是我的朋友“呋呋卡迪仆仆”
“呋呋卡迪仆仆”，这是安昂
哇哦，你居然给“剑齿糜狮”的幼崽
起了这么可爱的名字啊
真的？它长得哪点像“剑齿糜狮”啊
等它把巨齿和角都长出来，你就能看出来了
小家伙，你在外面瞎晃悠啥呢？
和妈妈走散了
御水师们善用流动的能量
御水师能够以退为进，以防为攻
借力打力，正所谓四两拨千斤
从他们那我领悟到了破解闪电的方法
这么说您要教我闪电易位？
如果你让能量从你的身体中流过
闪电就会穿身而过
你必须在体内创建一条通道
这条通道自手指，经手臂肩膀向下，直至丹田
丹田是人体内的聚能之所
也就是常说的“气海”
不过我那里，更像是广阔的大洋
从单田开始，引导能量重新向上而从另一手臂流出
记住能量必须从单田绕路而过
千万不能让闪电从心脏通过
否则伤害将是致命的
来吧，熟练一下肢体动作
体验一下能量的通路
就像这样
现在，集中精力在你的能量上
能感受到体内之气的沿通路流入流出吗？
是的
好的，要学会感受能量的流动
不错，你学会了
太好了！我已经准备好接受真正闪电的考验了
啥？你疯了吗？
闪电是十分危险的
那不正是你的意图吗？教我如何化解闪电的威胁
话虽如此，可我绝对不会向你发射闪电的
如果你幸运的话，希望你永远也不会用到这招
（可惜，第三季中这招还是用上了）
那好，既然你不帮我，我就自己去找闪电去
你好啊，我们找到了你的幼崽
你看，我们是没有恶意的
安昂，这太糟了，你得赶快把我弄出去
真是太糟了
拜托了，安昂，
赶快用御土术把我弄出去，没别的选择了
哦，不好
呜呼~快看我啊
你可别再丢下我了
我不会了
你在这儿干嘛呢？
坐山观虎斗
啥？
你刚才就一直在那儿？
没错
那你干嘛不来帮忙？
索卡那么危险
我也那么危险
你干嘛不救他出来，帮我们赶快离开
事不关己，我又瞎操什么心
够了，马上把我的滑翼还给我
现在就做！
做嘛？
御土术，亮脚趾
你能够脚不离地的打败一只猛兽
更值得欣喜的是你学会向我抗争了
滑翼还你了
可是...
快用御土术
你做到了
你是一名御土师了
真不能想象
哇哦，这真是一个美妙而感人的时刻啊
不如你们赶快把我弄出去，好让我和你们热情相拥啊
没问题，索卡
我看，还是我来救他出去吧，你现在还是新手
我可不想让你把他给碾碎了
是啊，温柔点啊
你们找到他了
我一直都困在那个土洞之中，生死未卜
在那时我认真思量了一件十分重要的事情
我意识到了...
嘿，卡塔拉，快看我
你做到了
我就知道你能行
你用了 “正面鼓励式教学法”吧？
没错，挺管用的
阿柏，阿柏，我学会御土术了，关键就在于下盘要稳
站如松，坐如钟
你不是一直都喜欢打击我吗？
我全部接受
现在，我会原样奉还的
来呀，来劈我啊
你不是从来都没有退缩过吗？

图书馆
这地里面都有些啥？
还真不少呢，这儿有数以百计的小...
嘘，我知道地下的一切都逃不过你的眼睛
不过不要毁了我给大家的惊喜
请大家欣赏
这就是我的管弦乐队
还管弦乐队呢
先唱个音阶来听听
我得承认这的确不错
不过咱们好像还有更重要的事要做
咱们应该想个计划
我们都商量好了
大家一致决定要休个黄金周
哪还有时间度假啊？
元素的修行我已经尽快而为了
每天都跟着拓芙和卡塔拉埋头苦练
看着没，我的箭头都快练没了
可不是呗，用点闲暇时间好好玩玩有什么不对
就算你掌握了四种元素又怎么样
现在咱们还没有烈火国的地图
又不是一直向西就能看见烈火王的老巢
笃，笃，笃！
有人在吗，烈火王在吗？
能找到才怪呢
连敌方的情报都没搞到手
要赢得这场战争谈何容易
好吧，等咱们度完假
立刻就去找索卡的情报
该你选了，卡塔拉，
这回黄金周你打算去哪啊？
那个朦胧棕榈洲怎样？
听起来就挺清爽的
没错，我以前去过那儿
那儿有个原始的天然冰泉，一般我都不用“原始”这个词
那儿可是自然奇观之一
这儿看来是换老板了
来个芒果
不如咱们一边享用水果酒
一边讨论计划吧
劳驾
别担心，要弄干很容易
哦，你简直就是个活化石啊
哪里哪里，我已经干了
我居然见到了气宗人
敝人翟教授，永固城大学人类学专业的学科带头人
跟我说说，你是从哪个气和寺来的？
南气和寺
太棒了，对了，你们主要的农作物是什么？
呃，水果派算是农作物吗？
哦，真是棒透了，不虚此行啊
我说教授，你一定是个老“驴友”吧
你那儿应该有新版的地图吧，我们的好像有点过时了
那是当然
啥？上面居然没有烈火国
想找个好地图咋就那么难呢？
看来你经常去沙漠旅游啊
可惜每次都是空手而归
之前我曾经发现过土强国的失落文明
我正致力于寻找一件无价之宝
那就是万事通的图书馆
你数年来行走于沙漠之中
就为了找个私人图书馆？
这位小姐，黄金和那座图书馆比起来简直就是一文不值
该馆内藏有广博的知识
子曰：知识
是无价的
嗯，好时机也是千金难买
哦，说的没错
传说，那座图书馆是由伟大的知识之神所建
那神灵就是万事通
他手下还有许多狐仙帮忙搜寻知识
哦，没想到那神还有如此迷人的助手呢
人家是想说那些助手长得像狐狸，索卡
（foxy:如狐的，性感的，
难怪索卡会那么想，男人嘛，呵呵）
你们说的都没错
它们的确十分迷人啊
万事通和他的助手们从天下搜集书籍
整理后陈列供人类阅读
以求世人能够不断完善自我
如果他们从天下搜集书籍的话
肯定也会有关于烈火国的资料吧
没准还有地图呢
我不知道世上是否有那种地图
倘若它存在的话
必藏于万事通图书馆中
就这么定了
安昂，也该我来挑选景点了
我想好在哪度假了
就在那座图书馆
呃，嘿，那我呢？
我啥时候能选啊？
你就知足吧
我都这么长工龄了，不是也才轮到
不过找到它的确有些难度
“死亡沙漠”我都去过几回了
差点没把小命都丢在那儿
想穿越那片沙漠并非易事
教授，要不要看看我们的飞天野牛？
飞天野牛？
你们居然有头飞天野牛
快滚开，御沙者，离那头野牛远点
我说，飞天野牛先生
你是你们物种最后的血脉吗？
哦，太棒了，我要是能说野牛话就好了
想要从野牛嘴里套出点话还真不容易
静一点，小猴子，回头再录你口供
哇哦，在沙漠里找这样的建筑不会很难吧
啊，那个图书馆真的存在吗？
有人说那只是传说而已
这话你之前咋不说呢？
图书馆在那儿呢
一会儿你们发现图书馆的时候
应该就会这么喊吧
我们在空中，那种富丽堂皇的
巨大建筑应该不难发现吧
快看那儿，那是啥呀
算了吧，很明显不是咱们要找的图书馆嘛
这画上的建筑明显要宏伟许多
那是什么动物啊
我想那就是传说中的探知者吧
哦，图书馆应该就在附近了
没错，这就是图书馆，看
它已经被完全埋没了
图书馆被埋没了？！
我的满腔豪情啊，现在只剩下满腔黄沙了
好吧，是时候进行挖掘工作了
别费劲了，没必要那么做
图书管里面看起来仍然完好如初
而且相当宽敞啊
那个探知者好像是从窗户进去的
不如我们爬上去看看吧
不如你们进去吧，我留在外面
图书馆又怎么惹到你了？
书那东西我之前也玩过，不过我得承认
我跟它们之间不来电
哦，对啊，抱歉
如果找到能听的书别忘了告诉我
别担心伙计，我不会再让你去地下了
你留在这儿陪拓芙吧
盯着我干嘛？
哦，这儿简直太美了
神灵还真是肯砸钱在设计装潢上啊
那些支柱真是巧夺天工
什么那么好笑？
没啥，我们只是爱死建筑学了
我也是哎
我的天哪
那鸟图腾全是用马赛克堆砌而成
这工艺简直是太赞了
呃，那是猫头鹰对吧
我知道你们都藏在后面了
你好，我是翟教授，永固城大学人类学的学科带头人
你们最好赶快离开
除非你们想变成我的人类学头像收藏
（head：头；头目，领头羊）
您想必就是将这图书馆带入凡间的神灵吧
没错，我就是万事通
知晓一万件事情
你们很明显是人类
我的研究成果已经禁止对人类开放了
你为什么那么讨厌人类
嗯，人类不断学习是虚荣心作祟
只是为了能够赶超其他人
若干年前来到这里的火宗人就是很好的例子
他们来这儿就是为了找到击败敌人的方法
那么...
你们这回来又是为了毁灭谁呢？
啥？不会，怎么会呢
不是为了毁灭，我们咋能干这种事呢？
那你们来此为何？
知识，当然是为了知识喽
如果你想骗过通晓万事的神灵
还应该再下下功夫
我没撒谎，降世神通也跟我们一起，他是...
灵界和凡间的桥梁对吧，他可以为我们担保
呃，没错，我会担保的
我们不会滥用图书馆中的知识的，好神灵
我向你保证
很好
我可以让你们博览我的馆藏
不过有个条件
你们首先要证明一下自己的价值
必须捐赠一些有价值的知识
我愿捐赠这本大册书，请笑纳
还是第一版，不错
我有一卷真正的御水天书
哦，这些插图十分的漂亮
呃，哦，我知道了
这个勉强算数
哦，好神灵，看看这个
这是一种特别的结，应该算是一种知识吧
你这人不太聪明吧
进去看书吧
把你都糊弄了，还说我不聪明
那么
你喜欢飞行吧？
当然了，我在地面上更舒服，能看到东西
只不过我看东西的方式和你们不一样
我通过双脚感觉地面的震动
不过这沙子质地太松软了
让我感觉一切都是模模糊糊的
我并不是说毛茸茸的不好
（fuzzy:模糊的；有绒毛的）
嘿，看那些狮龟样的东西真怪
呃，真是大惊小怪
安昂，你的一个前世曾是左撇子哩？
我就知道我一直都很特别
烈火国历史上最黑暗的一天
上面留有日期，不过到底发生了什么？
索卡，你要去哪儿？
我想知道烈火国最黑暗的一天到底发生了什么
可能对咱们会有帮助
关于烈火国的信息应该就在这儿
火宗人来过了
他们把有关烈火国的东西都销毁了
真是太不公平了
原以为我领先了烈火国一步
没想到人家早已经捷足先登了
我得查出那个最黑暗的一天到底发生了什么
你好啊，你这怪怪的小狐狸
看来它想要帮助你
嗯，真的啊，前方带路吧
这屋子简直太不可思议了
真是个机械奇观
就像个天文馆一样，显示了天体运行的情况
呃，是很美，不过，这对咱们有什么帮助？
也许这些刻度盘象征着日期和次数
索卡，把你捡到的那张羊皮纸上的日期输入这里试试
嘘，卡塔拉
别当着这狐狸的面说，它和那个猫头鹰是一伙的
哇哦，索卡以后去哪度假你说的算吧
这次黄金周度假真是太棒了
嘿，等等，太阳怎么了？
太好了，你把它给鼓弄坏了
它并没有坏
太阳转到了月亮后面，这就是日食
也就是记载中烈火国最黑暗的一天，我明白了
那天肯定发生了很糟的事情
具体是什么我不清楚，不过我知道原因
火宗在日食日不能使用御火术
抱歉，我太激动了
说的有理
就像在月食日，御水师不能使用御水术是一样的
真是个大发现
好吧，这吃的归你了
我们得带着这个信息去土强国都城永固城
等到下一个日食日
我们就趁火宗虚弱之机攻入烈火国
除掉那个烈火王
凡人真是天下乌鸦一般黑
全都是不可信赖的骗子
你们背叛了我的信任
从一开始你们就打算
为了邪恶的目的滥用知识
你不明白，如果要说邪恶的话，非烈火国莫属
你也见到它们是怎样对待你的图书馆的
他们是群极具破坏性的危险人物
我们需要这些信息
你们可不是第一批声称要
发起正义之战的人类
你们之前，已经有无数的人类来过这儿
都是为了寻求武器或是制敌的战略
我们别无选择
拜托，我们只是不顾一切的想保护我们挚爱的人
现在我也要保护我挚爱的东西了
你这是要干嘛？
我要将知识收回
这样就没人能滥用它了
他要将图书馆沉于地下
我们得赶快离开这儿
谁都别想离开这里
你们知道的已经太多了
我不是告诉过你吗，别靠着我
图书馆在下沉
图书馆在下沉
伟大的知识之神，我求您了
这些藏书可都是物价之宝啊
我们得赶快回地面上去
索卡，快走
咱们还没弄清到底哪天是日食日呢
别傻了，咱们出去再说
不，不会有其他方法的
离开这儿我们永远都不会知道的
安昂，跟我去天文馆，我需要掩护
卡塔拉，带上模模赶快离开这儿
但是...
快走！
快点，索卡
又咋的了？
谁在那儿？
咱们来这儿干嘛？
这个日历既然能告诉我们
以前日食发生的日期
必然也能查到下一个日食日的日期
不是要每天都查一遍吧
没那个必要
我们只需查一下孙进的彗星到来之前的日子即可
因为在那之后...
那个，我尽量不去想那之后的事情
日食啊，快点出现
就是它，日食
就在几个月之后
搞定，现在，咱们直奔永固城
别让我火大啊
不，不要下沉了
不
抱歉了，阿柏
看来我又要有新的标本收藏了
你的御水术在这儿可不好用
北极式，南极式，就连迷雾沼泽的招式
我也都研习过了
让你尝尝索卡式，学会了没？
等等，教授，快走啊
我不会走的，我不能
历尽千辛万苦我才找到这个地方
天下再也没有像这样的知识宝库了
我的余生将在此度过
咱们走吧
咱们办到了，我们知道了下一个日食的时间
现在烈火国要倒大霉了
阿柏哪去了？
-=未完待续=-

、FANS

水善国
土强国
火烈国
气和国
很久以前，这四大国和谐共处
然而，烈火国发起的战争结束了和平
只有同时掌握四种元素的降世神通才能结束战争
然而在大家最需要他的时候，他却消失了
年后，我和哥哥发现了转世的降世神通，
他是个御气师，名叫“安昂”
尽管他的御气术着实厉害
在拯救苍生之前，他要学的还有很多
但是我坚信
安昂 能拯救这个世界
-=降世神通=-
最后的气宗

降世神通 前情提要
降世神通绑架了我的女儿
我要你们把她给我带回家来
不惜一切代价
快滚开，御沙者，离那只野牛远点
图书馆在下沉
图书馆在下沉！
不！
对不起，阿柏
阿柏哪去了？
第二卷
土
第十一回
沙漠
你怎么能任由他们把阿柏带走？
你怎么不拦住他们？
我办不到，当时图书馆正在下沉
你们几个还在里面...
你可以进来找我们啊
我可以救它的
我站在沙漠上感不到一点震动
那些御沙者潜行到我附近
等我发现时已经来不及...
你根本就不在乎阿柏
你压根就没喜欢过它
你想赶它走，对吧？
安昂，别胡闹了
你知道拓芙已经尽力了
她刚刚救了咱们一命
现在又有谁能来救咱们呢？
咱们永远也走不出去了
你们这帮自私的家伙
就知道关心自己
你们根本就不担心阿柏的安危
我们都很关心
但我们现在也只是有心无力
我要去找阿柏
安昂，等等
咱们最好上路吧
只有我们知道日食日的秘密
我们得把这个好消息带到永固城去
如果咱们把那个大猫头鹰挖出来
它会不会载咱们一程以示报答
不如咱们停下来露营吧
不用了
不用担心我
真是不得清静
蒙科上校
(听起来像猴子上校)
是哪阵风把您吹来了？
就凭您西方神龙大将军的智商
能猜不出我们干啥来了？
你认识这些家伙？
当然
蒙科上校和他的莽骑兵
曾是风靡一时的风云人物
他们每个人都身怀绝技
而且还是个很有名的歌唱组合呢
我们可不是来开演唱会的
此行是为抓捕逃犯而来
你们不想先喝杯茶吗？
我可是想喝了
“喀哧”，不喝一杯吗？
我猜你肯定爱品茉莉吧
我没猜错吧？
别耍贫嘴了
把他们给我围住
能见到老朋友真好
可惜你的老朋友没有几个不想杀你的
嗯，不想杀我的老朋友...
你怎么走路不长...
什么？
算了
抱歉
快走伙计们，咱们可别走散了
如果我再出汗的话
跟你们粘在一起应该就不成问题
（stick together，又一处索卡式的幽默）
卡塔拉，给我点水喝吧
好吧，不过我们得省着点了
你不是把御术用的水给我们喝了吧
这水可是在沼泽男的身上用过的
一股沼泽味
抱歉，咱们只有这些水了
有补给了！看哪！
索卡，等等
不要乱吃那些奇怪的植物
这些植物很会存水哩
还是不喝为妙...
尝尝看
那是相当的解渴啊
喝口仙人掌汁，管保你止渴
没有比它止渴的了
最能解渴的就是它了
好了，我看你是喝高了
谁把拓芙给点着了？
我能喝点那个仙人掌汁吗？
可别，一个索卡就够我受的了
快走吧，咱们得找到安昂
咱们跑到大洋中间来干什么？
阿柏
阿柏
不
不
那是什么东西？
什么什么东西？
是个大蘑菇！
没准它很友好呢
咱们继续赶路吧
希望安昂能平安
友好的蘑菇！
多愁善感的大朋友
（mushy：多愁善感
mushroom：蘑菇）
没错，是有个光脚的盲丫头来过
同行的还有她的几个朋友
那是几天前的事了
他们没说要去哪儿吗？
那就看您的诚意如何喽
你看把你的手指都掰折
够不够诚意啊？
他们进沙漠了
他们没有可能生还的
对了，她爹是生要见人死要见尸吗？
死的谁要啊
她爹肯定是要活的

嘿，看哪
火宗的悬赏告示
那...
那你看看谁来了
我很抱歉，安昂
我知道这话可能有点残酷
但是我们现在应该集中精力找路出去
费什么劲，没有阿柏咱们
根本就没法活着出去
这是明摆的事
振作点，安昂
我们需要齐心协力
对吧，拓芙？
依我看
咱们是陷在一大碗沙做的布丁中了
我无能为力
索卡，知道怎么能找到永固城吗？
为啥不问问
在我头上盘旋的那些小鸟呢？
呃...我们要走出沙漠
让我们一起加油吧
安昂，快起来
大家都把手握起来
我们能行的
我们别无选择
我想咱们应该停下来过夜了
还有水吗？
就剩最后这点了
每个人都能分一点
模模，你要害死大家了
不要紧，没那么糟
哦，差点忘了
你会御术啊
索卡，把你从图书馆中
带出来的东西让我看看
什么？我可什么都没偷
是谁告诉你的？
肯定是你，你居然出卖我
索卡，我当时在场
没用的
那些东西不会告诉我们阿柏在哪儿的
是不会，不过可以指引我们找到永固城
我们可以让星星指引我们
我们可以趁夜里凉爽的时候赶路
而在白天的时候休息
多睡一会儿吧
几个时辰以后启程
这没有人能够帮我们
这些人全都是肮脏的流浪者
我们不也是吗
啊~
啊，太好了
我想我找到朋友了
咱们来这儿不是就为了赌局牌手吧
这可不是什么赌博
咱么这就逮了他们吧
这地方可全都是不顾死活的主儿
正所谓双拳难敌四手
好汉架不住狼多啊
我可不想让他们跟咱争赏金
稍安勿躁
能和您玩一局吗？
请客人先行
看来你喜欢用白莲来开局啊
已经好久没人用这种古法下棋了
用古法下棋的人总能觅得知音
咱们开始下吧
欢迎你，兄弟
白莲永远向知晓它秘密的人盛开
你们两个废话连篇的在唠啥呢？
我不是一直跟你说嘛
牌手并不仅仅是个游戏而已
我可没有闲功夫看这些老头整夜打哈哈
投降吧！
你们两个逃犯哪里逃！
我就知道
你们两个就是赏金万两的通缉要犯
你不说他会帮咱们吗？
他是在帮忙
等着看好戏吧
你们两个是不是想抓住他们
然后独享那笔黄金
黄金？
嗯，还真让你给说着了
来吧，都起来吧
咱们得赶路了
昨天我嘴里还是一股泥味呢
到今天就只剩下沙子味了
没想到我会那么怀念泥巴的味道
我醒着呢，一直睡不着
如果我们想走出这个沙坑就得赶快动身了
阿柏
阿柏？月公主怎么会需要它呢？
人家可是月神啊，她自己就会飞
只是朵云啊
等等！你说云？
拿着，飞上去对云用御水术
往这袋子里弄点水
哇哦，怎么这么少啊
对不起总行了吧
那可是沙漠上的云，我已经尽力了
你们其他人又做了什么？
你又做了些什么？
我试着让大家团结在一起
咱们还是上路吧
应该朝着这个方向走
哇哦！真倒霉
不知道该往哪走的感觉真不爽
这是哪个白痴在沙漠里埋了艘船啊
一艘船？
相信我，这脚我踢的很实诚
我的确感到震动了
这是那些御沙者用的砂舟
看哪，这上面还有像罗盘一样的东西
我敢打赌，它肯定能给我们指明出路
安昂，用御术送点微风出来
这样咱们就能滑行了
咱们一定能走出去的
能接待您如此高级的白莲教成员是我的荣幸
作为一位大师，你一定知道很多秘密吧
你们玩的那个牌手游戏
该不是为了花卉交易打掩护吧
这教会能不能提供点实惠的帮助啊？
请原谅我的侄子
他还没有入会
对这种神秘艺术简直是一窍不通
谁人在敲看守门？
吃果品神秘之人
只有教友才能入内
你在外面等吧
根据我的地图所示
这罗盘上的指针好像指的不是北向
小姐，放宽心
那些沙族人人造出的东西
肯定对这个地界很熟的
那就是罗盘指向的地方
一块大岩石
这肯定是沙漠的磁力中心
岩石？太棒了，快走
也许咱们在那儿能找到水
也许在那儿能找到几个御沙者
啊！终于踏实了
我想我已经开始清醒了
看哪！
跟烂企鹅肉一个味
啊~我有点迷糊
你可真是好了伤疤忘了疼
刚从仙人掌汁那清醒过来
又去舔洞穴的墙壁
我有天生的好奇感
我看这可不是一般的洞穴
好像被什么东西雕刻过
没错，看看这形状
好像有种嗡嗡的声音在附近
有什么东西正冲咱们过来
你往哪扔呢？
那块石头差点没砸扁我
抱歉，它们在空中我辨不清方位
这只交给我了
索卡，那儿啥也没有
我想我的头脑好像还没清醒
咱们得赶快离开这儿
我这儿御术用的水已经用光了
模模
再也不能失去任何人了
快，咱们赶紧下去
拓芙，冲那儿射快石头
发射！
太好了，打中了
她打中了，对吧？
是的，现在赶紧走
在你左边
怎么样？教内会议结束了？
都搞定了
咱们这就去永固城
永固城？
咱们去土强国都城干嘛？
那城里挤满了难民，多两个人没人会注意的
咱们可以乔装成老百姓在那避避风头
那是远离烈火国的最安全的地方了
当初就连我也没能攻陷那座都城
我不太喜欢管客人的闲事
不过大街上有两个人正在找他们
见过这两个人吗？
来我们的地头要干嘛
居然还有艘御砂舟
看起来，肯定是你们从哈米部落偷的
我们发现这艘船被遗弃在沙漠中
我们正与降世神通一同行走天下
我们野牛被人偷了
我们必须赶往永固城
真是贼喊捉贼
你居然敢说我们是贼
住嘴，“甘水”，没人指责我们的族人
如果他们说的是真的，我们应该尽一下地主之谊

我错了，老爸
我认出了那个儿子的声音
他是偷阿柏的贼之一
确定吗？
我一向过耳不忘
你偷走了阿柏
它在哪儿？你们把它怎么样了？
他们在说谎，他们才是贼
我的野牛在哪？
那个谁，这俩人哪去了？
听说他们进了你的店
你也看到了
这儿除了咱们，没有旁人
以为我们不知道呢
这后面有个秘密屋
把门给我踹开
嘿，那可是养花的地儿
看来有人不走运
弄丢了一张牌手棋子
咱们回去找那个丫头吧
快说它现在在哪？
你都做了些什么？
不...不是我干的
你说要给它戴上嚼子
你居然给阿柏戴嚼子？
对不起，我不知道它是属于降世神通的啊
快说阿柏在哪！
我把它换给了个商人
可能已经被运到永固城了
他们要在那儿卖掉它
拜托！我们会护送你们出沙漠的！
我们会全力相助的！
快离开这儿！
快跑！

咱们为什么要去土强国的都城？
那城里到处都是难民

她和其他的虚子武士都离镇去参战了
-快说阿柏现在在哪！
-我用它作了笔交易
它现在可能已经在永固城了
第二卷
土
第十二回
盘蛇关
御水炸弹！
你真行，这可是灵界图书馆里收藏了
年的老地图，你居然敢往上面泼水
抱歉
我说，弄清楚咱们该走哪条路了吗？
你看，我们刚走出沙漠
所以应该在这儿
这儿就是咱们要去的永固城
看来连接南北的唯一通路
就是这条狭长的陆地——“盘蛇湾”了
确定这是最佳路线吗？
这是唯一的路线
现在没有阿柏，只能走陆路了
别提阿柏，不要老接安昂的伤疤
卡塔拉，没关系的
之前弄丢了阿柏时，我是很难过
但我现在想集中精力赶往永固城
尽快告诉土强王关于日食日的消息
哦，那很好啊
很高兴你能感觉好些了
那么咱们就废话少说，直奔永固城吧
那边的流浪汉你们好吗？
我说，你们也是要去永固城吗？
没错，我们想在我老婆“莹”生下宝宝前赶到那里
太好了，那咱们就一起过盘蛇关吧
盘蛇关？只有走投无路的人才会走那个绝命路线呢
绝命路线啊
选的好，索卡
咱们的确已经“走投无路”了嘛
不如和我们一道去满月湾吧
有渡船可以载我们过湖
那可是去永固城的最快途径
那里也很隐蔽，火宗人是找不到的
嗯，咱们是坐安全的渡船，还是过绝命关隘呢？
都是火宗人干的好事
害得这么多人流离失所
我们都向往着有朝一日能够住进
永固城，过上幸福安宁的生活
谁能想象，时隔多年，我居然
回到了当年吃败仗的地方
还是以一个旅行者的身份
醒醒吧，还旅行者呢
我们可是流浪汉
这种风餐露宿的生活我真是受够了
跟我们想的一样啊
我叫杰，这两位是我的自由战士
臭虫和善射
嘿
你好
这么着吧
听说船长吃香的喝辣的
而我们却只能吃他剩的油渣
你说这公平吗？
他吃的能有多好？
能让你吃的高兴
吃的发胖的那种
要不要跟我们去顺点“山珍海味”出来？
算我一个
我不是跟你说过了吗
不许携带蔬菜上渡船
一个菜虫就能搞坏永固城的整个生态系统
来人哪！
啊！我的卷心菜啊！
（可怜的龙套）
下一位！
呃，买四张去永固城的船票
护照拿来
呃，没人告诉我们需要护照啊
你可不要有眼不识泰山
他可是降世神通！
哦，我每天能见到个神通
你们能不能有点创意啊
还有，动物不能上船，还要我叫警卫来吗？
不劳您大驾了
下一位！
就交给我吧
我叫北方拓芙，我需要四张票
哦！飞天野猪的金印
能为北方家族的成员服务是我的荣幸
你是该感到荣幸，看着没，
我是盲人，这三个呆瓜就是我的仆人
但是动物...
是我的“导盲狐猴”
好吧，一般来说每个护照只能买一张票，不过
鉴于您的护照等级如此之高
我想应该值四张票
非常感谢
好耶，咱们把那个嬷嬷给忽悠了
请出示你的票和护照
有问题吗？
没错
我是看你有点问题
我见过你这类人
有点刻薄，自认为很搞笑
对了，还和降世神通一起旅行
我们见过面吗？
你这是啥记性啊？
你应该记得这个吧？
苏琪！
索卡，能见到你真好！
你换了一身新行头，而且还没化妆
我简直都认不出你来了
那个倔嬷嬷让所有的警卫都统一着装
我说“无袖男”，最近健身了吗？
也没怎么锻炼啦，
就是没事拔个树干，做几个俯卧撑啥的
还有其他的虚子武士在附近吗？
没错，在你们离开虚子之后
我们也想为天下苍生做点实事
我们护送过一些流浪者至此
之后就一直驻守在这儿
好啊，模模，真高兴能见到你。
不过为什么你们几个要买渡船票？
让阿柏载你们过去不就行了
阿柏丢了，我们希望在永固城能找到它
我真的很遗憾
你还好吗？
我没事，拜托你们不要再担心我了
安昂神通，你得帮帮我们
我们的行李被偷走了
我们的护照，船票都不见了
我去跟那个嬷嬷谈谈
没有护照就不能买票
可是她怀孕了，东西还都被偷了
就请您网开一面吧
不许搞特殊化
如果我不按规矩办事，这儿岂不就乱套了
你知道那意味着什么，我们就会变成没文化的盲流了
把我们的票让给他们行吗？
不行
但是...
下一位
别担心，会让你们顺利到达永固城的
我带你们过盘蛇关
真难以置信，我们居然票都不要了
现在还要过盘蛇关
最难以置信的是，你到现在还在抱怨
我也跟你们一起去
你确定这是个好主意吗？
索卡，我以为你想让我同行呢
我的确希望，只不过...
只不过怎样？
没什么，有你同行我很高兴
这就是盘蛇湾？
我本以为这会刮罗圈风来的
就像盘蛇一样，嗯
看来名不副实啊
看看这上面写，太可怕了
-上面写的什么？
-上面写着：“绝望”
怎么能让我们放弃希望？
那是我们仅有的了
我也不是很懂，僧侣们常说希望只会让你分心
所以也许我们需要放弃希望
你这是说的什么话啊？
空有希望不会让我们到达永固城的
也不会帮我们找到阿柏
我们需要集中精力在现在做的事情上
一定能够度过这个难关的
好吧，既然你都这么说了
火宗的人控制着西湖
传言说他们在另一侧修建着什么，不过没人能弄清楚
我没事的
他们已经瞄准我们了，快走
苏琪，你没事吧，你得小心点，快走
多谢你能救我一命，拓芙
嘿，客气啥，索卡
苏琪，你不能睡在这儿
鬼知道这地方牢不牢靠，没准啥时候就塌了
索卡，我没事，别瞎操心
你说得对，说得对，你完全可以照顾好自己
等等
哦，不要紧了，我以为那是个蜘蛛
是我看花眼了
警卫来了
你知道，想念阿柏并没有什么不对的
你这是怎么了?
在沙漠时，你还一心要找到阿柏
可现在你好像一点也不关心它了
你也看到了我在那儿都干了些什么
把阿柏弄丢了我很生气，我都无法控制自己
我讨厌那种感觉
可是现在你让自己完全没有感觉了
的确，希望会带来失望
投入越多感情也可能伤害更多
但是你得向我保证，永远也别放弃关怀之心
来吧，你需要个拥抱
卡塔拉，多谢你的关心
今晚的月亮真漂亮
是啊，真漂亮
我知道你是想帮忙，不过我能照顾好自己
我知道你能
那你为什么还要那样过度保护我呢？
失去在乎的人是一件十分痛苦的事
在北极时发生了点事，我没能保护住某个人
我不想让那种事再发生了
我也失去了我所关心的人
不过他没有死，只是离开了
虽然我们才相处数日，可是他...
聪明，勇敢还很风趣
那人是谁？他比我高吗？
不，他和你一般高
那他长得更帅喽?
他就是你啊，傻瓜
哦
我不能
对...对不起
不，不是你的错
臭虫，这个名字对于一个年轻男子来说够特别的啊
因为我不是什么男子，我是个女孩
哦，我说得嘛，可爱的女孩叫这个名字正好
我知道，你是对的，走自己的路，让别人说去吧
多谢你善射
听说，永固城的人每晚都能吃到像这样的饭
我真是迫不及待的要亲眼见见那座城池了
那座城池的确是十分雄伟壮阔
这么说你之前去过那儿？
去过一次，不过已经物是人非了
我有一个不堪回首的过去
所以我才要去永固城重新开始生活
改过自新
真是难能可贵啊
我相信只要你愿意，一定可以改变自己的生活
一切都可以重新来过
大家混成一排
安昂，搭把手
那是什么东西？
终于知道这儿为啥叫盘蛇关了
苏琪，你不是很了解这种大海怪吗？想办法把它赶走
我们只是住的离鳗鱼近点而已
对付它我也是外行
哦，伟大而有力的海蛇啊
请接受我们卑下却很美味的贡品吧，万分感谢
索卡
我来分散它的注意力，卡塔拉，赶快带大家走
拓芙，别怕，只不过是冰
实际上，我宁愿留在我能看见的陆地上
好吧，我来了
做的好，顺着我的声音走
想听不见都难
就快到了
救命啊，我不会游泳
我来救你，拓芙
救命啊！
哦，索卡，你救了我一命
事实上，是我救的
哦，那个...呵呵...你还是走吧，让我淹死算了
那就是城墙了
现在去往永固城的路将是一路平坦了
哦，不好
怎么了？
我要生了！
什么？现在？
你就不能再坚持一下吗？
索卡，冷静点，在老家我曾帮姥姥接生过许多小孩
这和接生北极豹可是两码事，这可是真人啊！
那叫婴儿，我也帮忙接生过很多的
安昂，去弄点破布来
索卡，搞点水
拓芙，给我们搭个土帐篷，最好大一点
苏琪，跟我来
你知道吗，刚看到你的疤，我就知道你是谁了
你和我一样都是无家可归的人
我们这些人应该团结在一起，互相照应
因为别人是不会在乎我们的
我最近明白了一个道理
单打独斗并不是最好的求生方法
做的好，莹
索卡，快拿水来？
准备用力啊
一，二，三，用力啊！
是个女孩
你到底去不去看看小孩儿啊
可别再像个老太太一样晕倒了
不会的，我没事的
安昂，进来看看吧
她看起来很健康
她可真漂亮
看上去湿嗒嗒的
咱们给她起什么名字呢？
希望咱们女儿的名字能够与众不同
寓意深刻
最近我经历了很多的苦难
是你们让我重新燃起了...希望
我知道我们的孩子该叫什么了
希望
希望，这真是个好名字
我原以为只要试着坚强就可以挺过去
不过那只是在逃避罢了
看到这家人齐心合力
其乐融融
让我重拾起对阿柏的想念
还有对你们的感情
我保证一定会尽快找到阿柏的
我真的需要这么做
永固城再见
跟我向那个臭毛球问好
安昂，你会找到它的
我知道
谢谢你，卡塔拉
模模，准备好了吗？
索卡，真高兴能再见到你
哇哦，等等，怎么感觉你是在向我告别呢？
我此行是为了确定你们能够顺利通过盘蛇关
我现在应该回到虚子武士当中去
这么说你是来保护我的吗？
那个，那晚的事我很抱歉
我们谈着谈着...我只是太激动了
有点口不择言，其实...
你说的太多了
抱歉，模模，看来不能马上去找阿柏了

第二卷
土
第十三回
巨钻
这巨钻可是一项伟大的科学壮举
它拥有巨大的破坏力量
等它钻穿城墙
我们的大军就可以长驱直入
土强国即将土崩瓦解
您就可以您父皇的名字来命名这座都城了
没有什么可以阻挡我们
嗯，好像前面正有几个肌肉男在挡路
拜托
任何御土术的攻击都不能破坏巨钻的金属外壳
哦，你说的对 卿部长
不过小心点总没有坏处
梅，泰丽，把那几个御土师给我收拾了
终于有事做了
安昂，你怎么回来了
你不是应该去找阿柏吗？
没错，不过被件事耽搁了
这事可是非同小可啊
有什么事能比找阿柏更重要
就是它
好不容易才到了永固城
没想到这里也不安全
没有一个地方是安全的
你们几个到这儿来干嘛？
城墙上禁止平民闲晃
我是降世神通，带我去见你们的长官
欢迎您大驾光临永固城的外城
不过您多虑了？
多虑了？
没错
一切尽在我的掌握之中
我向您保证，火宗人不可能钻透城墙
之前也有人妄图穿墙而过
不过都以失败而告终
那西方神龙呢?他可是攻进了
那个...呃...确实没错
不过他很快就被击退了
无论如何，永固城可不是浪得虚名的
这座城市固若金汤
所以才不叫它“不固城”
（Na Sing Se=Nothing save? 不安全）
是有一定道理的
是啊，谢谢你的导游，不过这巨钻仍是个大麻烦
放心，我已经派了..
一支名为“泥球队”的精锐部队前去阻止了
真是个好名字，让人印象深刻
准备，进攻
我们完蛋了
你给我振作一点
你说的对，抱歉
现在你该需要神通的帮助了吧？
是的，拜托了
问题是，我们怎样才能阻止那个家伙
你们看我干什么？
谁让你是“主意男”来着
这么说只有我一个人能想出点子来啊
压力好大啊
差点忘了，你还是“牢骚男”来着
发点牢骚又无伤大雅
是李先生和...呃，“牧师”先生对吗？
应该念做“木须”
用你来对我指手画脚啊？
岂敢岂敢
没人说你就像支盛开的花一样美丽吗？
你的美真是沁人心脾啊
帅哥，那就让你看个够吧
欢迎来到永固城
就当我没看到
我相信李会成为一位不错的自由战士
他和我们一样，都在
寻求着自己的人生道路
杰，你并不了解他
他脸上的那道疤可不是御水师弄的
再说了，你觉得现在咱们是走上正途了吗？
那还用说，新的自由战士团队需要像李这样的人
“善射”你觉得呢？
我会考虑的
他怎么了？看起来并没有受伤啊
他的气被闭塞了
这是谁干的？
两个丫头伏击了我们
其中一个快速的在我身上戳了几下
我突然间就不能用御土术了，全身动弹不得
然后她就消失了
是泰丽
她虽然看起来柔弱
可她却深知人体结构和弱点所在
没有外伤，却像在身体里给了你几拳
咋啦？
你刚才所说的
就是我们干掉那个巨钻的方法
就用泰丽击倒大块头御土师的方法
攻击它的弱点
让我们从里面把它卸了
我弄个烟雾阵做掩护，烟尘大很难看清
所以一定要在我后面紧跟了
跑！
嘿，快看那片烟尘
看起来真是“滚滚的”，是叫“滚”吧
（poofy：脂粉气的，poof：吹蜡烛声）
别担心公主殿下，没什么怕的
大家快进洞
这下面好黑啊，我啥也看不清
哦，不好哦，还真糟呢
抱歉
从那儿进
拓芙，快点啊
我可不想进到那个金属怪物的肚子里
在那儿御土术都用不了
我在这儿想办法减慢它的速度
那好吧，祝你好运
我需要一张蓝图，知道这儿的结构
才能找出它的弱点所在
我们上哪儿去搞那东西去？
你这是干嘛？有人会听见我们的
就是为了让他们听见
这么个大家伙肯定会有技师来打理
如果有东西坏了的话...
他们一定会去修的
嗨
你真是帮大忙了，谢啦
看来这个巨钻由两个主要结构组成
我们在的地方就是内层机构
另外一部分就是外壳
内外两层由这些支柱连接
如果我们把这些支柱弄断
那整个钻头就散架了
我说，你们做好进城后的打算了吗？
好喝的热茶啊！全永固城最好的茶！
哦！来杯茉莉花茶吧
呸！呃，全永固城最凉的茶还差不多
真可恶！
嘿，能和你聊聊吗？
如果你我合作的话
可以让这个城市变的更好
愿意成为自由战士的一员吗？
谢了，你的好意我领了，我无意加入
来吧，顺船长食物的那一票咱们配合的不错
我们还能为这些难民做更多事情
我说过不了
那就不强求了
嘿！
你干嘛在大庭广众之下用御火术？
你做事一向谨慎，怎么会做出这种傻事来
你可能觉得因为一杯撒了的茶哭不值得，不过
我真的好伤心啊
哇哦，没想到这支柱居然有一人多厚
要把它弄断看来没那么容易
别老咱咱的，其实只有我和安昂在干活
各有分工嘛，我负责想主意
你们负责用御术锯柱子
齐心协力，我们就是“神通队”
加油啊伙计们，别轻言放弃，咱们...
我是说，你们就快成功了
按照这个速度，不可能在
巨钻到达城墙之前把它搞垮
我不知道自己还能撑多久
听到了吗？我们成功了，咱们最好赶快离开这儿
报告大家一个好消息
咱们的巨钻已经到达永固城的城墙之下了
胜利指日可待
拜托了支柱，动一下
真糟，真是太糟了
咱们在这些柱子上耗了太多时间了
也许我们不需要把他们都弄断
拓芙曾经教过我，每次进攻必须倾注全力
索卡，试着攻击我
你必须要快而准
击中一系列的穴位，就可以破解敌人的招式
在他挣扎着恢复的时候，给他最后一击
毫不夸张地说，他自身的重量就可让他倒下
所以说我们只需削弱支柱，而不用费力全都弄断
之后我们只要爬到巨钻之上，给他最后一击
它就会乖乖的散架了
城中的人民，乃至整个世界都指望我们了
当然“整个世界&quot;不包括火宗的人
加油啊“亮脚趾”，快点啊
这个行了，咱们接着弄下一个
军部长，一个技师遭人暗算
他的图表被偷了
军部长，右舷的一个支柱已被完全切断
被人蓄意破坏了
女士们，该咱们上场了
干的好“神通队”，
现在安昂只需上...钻头顶部！
哇哦，阿祖拉，你说的对
是降世神通...还有他的朋友们
嘿
你俩快出去吧，我知道该怎么办
等等，这些水你更需要
跟着他们，神通就交给我了
泥浆管道？这是干啥用的？
就是输送石头和水混合物的管道
也就是咱们的逃生通道
呃，真恶心
走吧，阿祖拉发话了，咱们得跟着他们
她要是不满意就一个闪电劈死我算了
我可不想跳进这烂泥汤里
看你还怎么作怪，你这个马戏团的小丑
卡塔拉，顶住
这会使巨钻内部产生压力
只要安昂给它最后一击，它就废了
模模，就在这儿结果它吧
孙将军，叫士兵停止向这儿发射石头
士兵们，不管你们怎么做
就是别停止向那儿发射石头
妹妹，技术不错嘛
坚持住啊，气息很重要啊
别老是告诉我应该做什么，今天我真是受够你了
你简直就像个会说话的肥猪猴一样
少废话，干好你的活！
你们需要帮助吗？
拓芙，帮我把这个下水道塞上
这儿要是有个御金属师就好了
模模，快离开这儿
多谢你模模，你救了我一命
我现在只要....
事实上，这正是我想要的
成功了
我们败了
去往永固城的乘客请赶快上车
杰，放轻松
那老头只不过喝个热茶而已，有啥大不了的
他是自己弄热的，那俩人是火宗人
这小孩好俊啊
谢谢
我只是想说，今天“神通队”干的不错
别老“神通队”“神通队”的
不管你说多少遍，这名字一样没有感染力
那你看
“飞去飞来队”咋样？
这名字多好，还有个“安昂”在里面
“Boomer-Aang”
（Boomerang, 飞去飞来，Boomer-Aang，谐音）
这名字还不错
咱们还是边进城边说吧
“安昂帮”怎么样？
索卡
那就“可怕四人组”吧
你别疯了
咋了，咱们是挺可怕的嘛！

水善国
土强国
火烈国
气和国
很久以前，这四大国和谐共处
然而，烈火国发起的战争结束了和平
只有同时掌握四种元素的降世神通才能结束战争
然而在大家最需要他的时候，他却消失了
年后，我和哥哥发现了转世的降世神通，
他是个御气师，名叫“安昂”
尽管他的御气术着实厉害
在拯救苍生之前，他要学的还有很多
但是我坚信
安昂 能拯救这个世界

降世神通 前情提要
&lt;i&gt;阿柏被偷走了&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;我们希望在永固城能找到它&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;敝人翟博士，永固城大学人类学的学科带头人&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;据说这座图书馆收藏了大量的知识&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;火宗人在日食日不能使用使用御术&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;我们得去永固城，把这个消息告诉给土强王&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;你怎么能在大庭广众之下使用御火术&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;那老头不就是喝了杯热茶嘛，有什么大不了的&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;他是自己弄热的&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;那两个人是火宗人&lt;/i&gt;

围墙迷城
看，那就是内城墙了
没想到咱们居然能活着来到永固城
嘿，别太乐观
没准还有什么巨大的、能爆炸的
火宗铲土机来攻击咱们呢
也许整个都城会被淹没于水下
到处都是虾兵蟹将
你不是又喝仙人掌汁了吧？
我只是想说，咱们周围总是有怪事发生
别担心，安昂
咱们会找到阿柏的
这座都城可不小
就阿柏那个块头，怎么可能藏得住啊？
又回到城市里了，真是太棒了
咋了？这儿不是很棒吗？
到处都是墙
到处都有清规戒律
不信你就等着瞧，不出几天你就会讨厌这里了
伙计，我这就去找你
它就在这儿，我能感觉的到
你们好，我叫朱蒂
能够作为神通在永固城的向导
我真是太荣幸了
你们想必就是索卡，卡塔拉和拓芙吧
欢迎来到这座奇迹之城，咱们这就开始？
好的
我们带来了有关火宗军队的消息
想立刻呈递给土强王
太好了
那咱们就开始观光了
最后一站将是你们在这儿的新家
你们一定会喜欢的
可能你没有听清楚
我们得跟土强王唠唠战争的事，这十分重要
这儿可是永固城，没有哪比这儿更安全的了
这里是外环
这墙是用来干什么的？
哦，永固城有许多城墙
有的在外围用来保护我们的安全
还有一些在城内，用来维持秩序
这里是供新进城的人居住的地方
当然这里还住着木匠、铁匠之流
住这儿的人都是手艺人
看这儿，多么的古雅而又生机勃勃啊
不过在这儿行走也要多加小心
为什么要把穷人都围在这里居住？
所以我以前都不会来这儿
我老早就听说过这儿的生活方式
与僧侣们传授的那种相去甚远
我只是想让咱们的新住所看上去好一点
没准某人哪天就会带个女朋友回来呢
这座城就像个监狱一样
我可不想在这儿开枝散叶
生活在哪儿都可以扎根
不管你是否刻意播种
打起精神来，我给咱俩找了份新工作
今天下午就上岗
看看，火宗人居然就混在咱们当中
杰，那个老头不过是拿着杯热茶罢了
不能证明他是火宗人啊，就算他是
我们就该去攻击他们吗？
我原以为咱们已经告别过去
另觅新生了
没错
等我找到证据，就报告给捕快
剩下的交给他们来处理
行吗？
这是永固城的中环
这里可是商业中心哦
商店、饭店随处可见，大学也在这里
我们之前曾经见过一位永固城大学的教授
他带我们去了座古老的地下图书馆
在那我们发现了关于战争的情报
这消息十分重要，必须上报给土强王
这儿的历史很让人着迷吧？
看，这是中环最古老的建筑之一，城镇礼堂
这女的是不是聋了？
我跟她说的话，她肯定一句也没落
这就叫“熟视无睹”，你习惯就好了
(be handled : 处理)
呃，你们现在已经
很像专业的茶馆店小二了
感觉怎么样？
太可笑了
呃，这制服有更大号的吗？
我记得好像还有
我去找找看，你们先喝杯茶
呃~这茶怎么跟热水冲的树叶汁一个味
皇叔，茶不就是那么个东西吗
咱们可是一家人
你怎么能说出这种话呢？
咱们得好好整顿整顿这里
内环是达官贵族居住的地方
你们的居所就在附近
那面高墙里面是什么？
那些穿袍子的丑男是干嘛的？
那里面就是皇宫啦
那些人是名为“戴笠”的特工
该组织隶属于永固城的文化部
他们为我们的传统保驾护航
我们现在能去土强王吗？
哦，还不行，没谁可以冒然拜见土强王的
我们到了，这就是你们的新家
还有个好消息，你们请求拜见
土强王的请求已经被批下来了
大概一个月左右就能安排你们觐见
比平常快多了
要一个月！
具体说，需要六至八周
这儿不错吧？希望你们能在这过得愉快
能过的愉快才怪呢
没事只能在这儿消磨时间
不能再快点吗？
土强王管理的可是世界上最好的城市
他每天都要日理万机
如果时间允许的话
他会尽快召见你们的
如果要在这儿耗上一个月
咱们应该多花点时间去找阿柏
我很乐意护送你们去任何地方
我们可不需要保姆
哦，我不会阻碍你们的
再说了不管你们也不是待客之道啊
开始今天的行程吧？
抱歉，我从没听说过飞天野牛
原来还有这种动物呢
如果有人偷了动物而不想让别人知道
他们一般会去哪儿销赃？
黑市在哪儿？是谁在经营？
快说，你肯定知道
开黑市可是犯法的
你们还是赶快走吧
你的狐猴把我的麻雀珍珠鸡都吓坏了
在这附近，我可没见过有御沙者或是游牧者
你去问问翟教授吧，他在这儿主讲沙漠文化
好吧，那关于“与烈火国交战”的问题
我该请教哪位教授呢？
我不知道，我不是政治学的学生，我得去上课了
那个，抱歉没人见过你的野牛
你们不妨去休息一下吧
一会儿有人会送晚餐过来的
嘿，跟我来
你是降世神通吧，听说你进城了，我姓庞
幸会啊，庞
我说庞，这城里怎么了？
为什么大家都害怕谈论战争？
战争？害怕？你啥意思？
你好像在发抖啊
我只是个政府的小官员
熬了三年才盘了这幢房子
我可不想惹麻烦
谁会找你麻烦？
听着，你们不能在这儿提战争二字
无论你们要做什么，都要离“戴笠”远点
咱们泡壶茶喝呀？
都在茶馆都工作一天了
我现在见茶就想吐
怎么会，喝茶就跟呼吸一样是必需的
看到火石了吗，我要烧壶水
它们在我这儿
老头，用你的御火术吧
你要去哪儿？
我从邻居那儿借来了，真是好人啊
有了！我知道怎样才能见到土强王了
别做梦了，人家都说了
“没有谁可以冒然拜见土强王的”
国王今晚将会在宫中
为他的宠物熊举办一个派对
是鸭嘴兽熊吗？
这上面没说
他的宠物肯定是臭鼬熊
没准是穿山甲熊
那是地鼠熊？
只是熊而已
这地方真怪
到时皇宫里肯定挤满了人
我们可以偷偷的溜进去
没用的
为啥？
无意冒犯，不过就你这乡下人举止
在那些达官贵族中
肯定一眼就能被看出来了
你们一点都不懂礼仪
啥？我们不懂礼仪，也不知道谁成天邋里邋遢的
我可是受过正规的社交礼仪培训
我只是懒得用
你们都没有学过，现在想学也太晚了
啊哈，但是你学过啊，你可以教我们
没错，四种元素我都掌握了
学个礼仪能有多难？
晚上好啊，水族的索卡先生
水族的卡塔拉女士
还有您来自模模王朝的模模王
模模陛下，晚上好
安昂神通，一向可好啊？
卡塔拉勉强可以充数
你俩装个侍者的话没准能混进去
我自己感觉挺好的啊
-土
-火
哇哦，你看起来真美
社交的第一准则，不要与平民交谈
我们会混进派对的，到时再伺机开侧门放你们进去
杰，咱们得谈谈
谁？哦，太好了，是你们
你们去哪了？我需要你们帮我盯梢
我俩已经讨论过了
你对此事太过专注了
这样对你不好
哦，是吗？你们都这么想吗？
我们来这儿是为了重新开始生活的
可你却抱着过去不放
即便你是对的，也没有真凭实据呀
那就帮我找出证据来
杰，你还是放手吧
难道你们忘了为何要重新开始生活？
是火宗人让我们流离失所
是他们夺走了我们挚爱的人
如果你们不帮我，我就自己去找证据
这是全城最好的茶了
秘方其实就是爱心
回头给你涨工资
我可是等腻了，这两个人是御火师
我知道他们是火宗人
我看到这老头弄热了一杯茶
茶馆的店小二不就是干这个的嘛
我跟你说，他是御火师
孩子，把剑放下来，慢慢的别紧张
快还手啊，让大家看看
来啊，亮一招瞧瞧
你想比试吗？那就如你所愿
请出示请柬
这个应该可以吧
没有请柬不许入内
请你们站到一边
看，庞家和余松汉家的人正在里面等着我们
你最好不要惹他们生气，快让我们进去
请你们站到一边
先生，很抱歉打搅您，我和表妹把请柬丢了
她还是个盲人
你能帮帮我们吗？
我们的家人已经进去了，他们现在一定很担心
我很荣幸
跟我来吧
它把好吃的都造了
安静点，好不容易才搞到挨着熊的位置
很美，不是吗？
对了，敝人是长风，皇家的文化部长
我是画眉，这是“芬”
（Dung：粪）
你们的家人在哪？我想认识认识他们
嗯，我还没看到他们
肯定一会就能找到，多谢你的帮忙
别担心，我好人做到底
在找到你们的家人之前
我是不会离开你们的
咱们接着找吧
她们在哪？
我看，用我的B计划怎么样？
不如让模模装鬼吧？
等它分散了警卫的注意力，我们就可以趁机溜进去
或者就跟着他们进去吧
拓芙说，我们装侍者没准能混进去
好吧，不过别忘了模模鬼计划，那招肯定管用
你用剑应该用累了吧
你干嘛不赶快用御火术对付我？
孩子，别傻了，你这是在干什么？
打赌你现在肯定想发个火球解决我吧
你才是需要帮助的人
看见没？火宗人想灭我的口
不会让你得逞的
拓芙和卡塔拉哪儿去了
别管她们了，先找土强王吧
我都不知道他长啥样
就是挺“贵族”的，穿着长袍，戴昂贵的珠宝
这儿的人都那样
再来个螃蟹泡芙
你找到我们了
你的脚步声可逃不过我的耳朵，亮脚趾
能进来还真多亏了你们啊
抱歉，那个护送我们进来的人，一直跟着我们不走
哪个人？
你们在这儿干嘛？
你们得赶紧离开，不然我们都会有大麻烦的
不见到土强王我们是不会走的
你们不了解，你们必须走
抱歉，不，别喊
是降世神通，哦，不知道您会大驾光临
接着吸引他们的注意力，我去找皇上
大家看好了
把武器放下
抓住他们，他们是火宗人
这孩子一定是认错人了，我们只不过是流浪汉罢了
这个年轻人闯进我的茶馆
攻击我的雇员
没错，长官，我目睹了全经过
这个疯小孩居然攻击全城最好的茶道师
哦，哦，您缪赞了
跟我们走一趟吧
你们不明白，他们是火宗人
你们得相信我
安昂，土强王来了
陛下，幸会啊
嘿，放开我
神通，能见到你是我的荣幸
我叫长风，永固城的中宪大夫，“戴笠”的总领
请借一步说话
你的朋友都在尚书房侯着呢
为什么不让我们见土强王？
我们带来了可以战败烈火国的情报
土强国没那种闲功夫浪费在政治争斗...
和军事打击之类的琐事上
这消息可是非同小可啊
土强王的皇权是要靠永固城文化的传承来维系的
颁布法令条例才是他的责任
而监督协调城中其他资源则是
我的工作，当然军队也是我说的算
这么说土强王只是个傀儡？
他只是你手中的玩偶
哦，不，不！陛下
可是人们顶礼膜拜的领袖
怎能用无尽的战争中来让他分心
但是我们发现在日食日火宗人将无抵抗之力
我们应该发起一个入侵...
够了，不想再听你们的胡言乱语
永固城法律明确规定
不许在城内提战争二字
散布关于战争内容的消息
只会使永固城居民惶惶不可终日
你们得相信我，他们是火宗人
他们不赢得战争是不会善罢甘休的
冷静点，你现在安全了
我们的经济将被破坏
我们的和平生活，我们的传统都将会消失
永固城内没有战争
你这是什么话？照你这么说
那些难民又是从哪来的？事实是掩盖不住的
永不谈论暴力，永固城就会永保和平、且秩序井然
它将是世上最后一片乐土
城中没有战争，在这我们是安全的
我们是自由的
纸是包不住火的，他们总有一天会知道的
我会告诉他们，我会让他们都知道
直到现在，我仍待你们为上宾
但是从今以后，戴笠特工队将会时刻监视你们
如果你们敢乱来，定会将你们驱逐出城
你不是一直在找你的野牛吗？
若是找不到它，你一定会很遗憾的
朱迪将会送你们回家
请跟我来吧
朱蒂哪去了？
我是朱迪，我将会带您们游览这座奇迹之城

-=拓芙和卡塔拉的故事=-
拓芙，不起来洗漱一下吗？
我搞定了
你不洗一下吗？看你现在灰头土脸的...
好像全身都是脏兮兮的
你管这叫脏，对我来说这可是养身神土
嗯，我知道了
咱俩女孩需要独处一日
我非去不可吗？
会很有趣的
贵妇美容院？听上去和我很搭的
准备好了吗？咱们今天得好好做个全身养护
没问题，卡塔拉
你说得算，只要他们不碰我的脚就行
嗯，还不赖嘛
虽然我不常涂脂抹粉的，今天一试确实...
...挺淑女的
那太好了
是时候去找些乐子了
妆化得不错嘛
多谢夸奖
作为小丑妆挺不赖的
别听她们的，咱们继续走
她长得挺可爱的
跟你那个贵宾狗猴穿上毛衣时一个样
小星，真有你的
咱们走，拓芙
不，不，你说的确实很好笑
“像你的贵宾狗猴”？
你们知道更好笑的是什么吗？
这才叫好笑呢
那些丫头真是不知所谓
没关系的，失明唯一好处就是
我不用浪费时间在担心自己的容貌上
我不在乎自己长得怎么样
更不需要别人的认可
我就是我
托芙，这就是我欣赏你的地方
你既坚强又自信，又有自知之明，嗯...
我知道你并不在乎
不过...你真得很漂亮
是吗？
没错，你很美
我也想回夸你几句
不过我不知道你长得什么样
谢谢你，卡塔拉
-=艾洛的故事=-
如果是想准备个浪漫的野餐
推荐您用这个薰衣草制的篮子

*飘落慢悠悠*
*就像脆弱的小贝壳哟

*勇敢的兵娃哟*

犯错时最好赶快承认
这样才能挽回尊严
你们这群小兔崽子
正好拆了你们的骨头来补窗户
不过这回还是算了，快跑！
我说你
把你的钱都拿出来
你这是在干嘛？
打...打劫呗
就你这种架势？
啥？你在瞎扯嘛？
老头，赶快把你的钱交出来
你这种站姿下盘不稳
很容易就会被撂倒
下盘稳了，你的话才会更有威慑力
好多了
不过说实话，你可不是当劫匪的料
我知道，只不过我...我有点困惑
你觉得我会是个很好的按摩师吗？
那当然
太好了！从来没有人能如此信任我
人有自信固然很好
不过能从别人那得到认可更是难能可贵
孩儿，生辰快乐！
那时如果有我在你身边就好了
*叶儿离藤蔓哟*
*飘落慢悠悠*
*就像脆弱的小贝壳哟

-=安昂的故事=-
嘿，好啊，伙计，饿了吧
那可不，它们都饿坏了
由于来参观的孩子越来越少
“戴笠”就不再给我们拨款了
而孩子们不来是因为这儿又脏又破
那是什么动物？
哦，那是兔袋鼠
真希望能给它一片广阔的草原
让它能够幸福的奔跑跳跃
那咱们说干就干吧~
你说啥？
我记得在城墙外有一片开阔地
可这么多飞禽走兽
你要怎么把它们运出去啊？
别担心，动物都听我的话
我的卷心...
哦，我恨死这句台词了
看来我有点眼高手低了
你们赶快把城门打开吧
不然怎样?
你自己看吧
打开城门
我说，管理员先生
这个新园址你还满意吗？
这真是太棒了，神通
你可以考虑以驯养动物为生了
妈咪，“雪片”先生又从家里跑出来了
弗罗斯金斯?
你在下面干什么呢？
我看，你还是救人比较在行

这是在干嘛？
冬夜了无趣
冬月映相思
垂泪盼天明
好诗啊~
这般对不住
不知何人偏撞吾
故而误闯入
五七还又五，凑音节也能造俳句
蠢才还不俗
索卡就是吾
水族小伙非凡物
绝非二百五
泼猴学人叫，春日爬上小树梢，不知天更高
自作小聪明，堆砌词藻说不停，比比看谁赢
为习诗书夜以继日
岂容你小视！
小视又怎样？
独滑木舟都不惧，何惧小诗句？
坚果或水果，秋来瓜熟终要落，扁碎因人过

皇叔，咱们有麻烦了
有个茶客一直在盯着咱们
别往那儿看，就是那边坐在角桌里的姑娘
他肯定发现我们是火宗人了
我不是说过别看吗？
你说的没错，祖寇
最近她确实常常光顾这里
看来她好像是瞧上你了
说啥？
谢谢你的茶
敢问贵姓啊？
免贵姓李，我和叔叔刚搬来不久
幸会啊，李，我姓金
谢谢，嗯，那个...
不知你是否愿意跟我出去约会？
他求之不得呢
太好了，日落时分咱们在茶店门口见吧
嘿，那个，看看你，你好可爱啊
这头形我叔叔可是理了十分钟的呢
那么，你觉得这座城怎么样？
还好
你平时都有啥爱好？
没啥
打扰了，客官
要不要给您和您的女友上点甜点？
她不是我的女朋友
你一个女孩子家家的...饭量还真不小
过奖了...
我说李，你和你叔叔来这儿之前以何为生？
嗯，我们云游天下，四海为家
你们为何要四处漂泊呢？
我们，呃，我们曾在马戏团里待过一阵
是吗？你是表演什么的呢？等等，让我猜猜
你是变戏法的吧？
不错，我是变戏法的
我一直都想学两招，你能给我亮两招吗？
好久没练，有点生疏了
没关系啦
嘿，我想带你去这城里我最爱的地方看看
你不来看这灯火喷泉可是要后悔的哟
灯光在水中倒映，水面波光闪闪
那是相当漂亮啊
怎么会这样，他们居然没点灯
闭上你的眼睛，别偷看
好了，现在睁开眼睛吧
怎么回事？这些灯怎么亮了?你怎么...
我给你带了点礼物
这张优惠券可以免费喝一杯茶
李，你真好
不用谢我，这是我叔叔的主意
他说你是最有价值顾客
你叔叔真是个好老师
我也有礼物要给你，现在该你闭上眼睛了
怎么了？
一言难尽
我得走了
祖寇殿下，今晚过的怎么样？
不错

很久以前，这四大国和谐共处
然而，烈火国发起的战争结束了和平
只有同时掌握四种元素的降世神通才能结束战争
然而在大家最需要他的时候，他却消失了
年后，我和哥哥发现了转世的降世神通，
他是个御气师，名叫“安昂”
尽管他的御气术着实厉害
在拯救苍生之前，他要学的还有很多
但是我坚信
安昂 能拯救这个世界

最后的气宗

降世神通 前情提要
我一道过来，是为了确保你们能顺利通过盘蛇关
现在我需要回去与其他虚子武士会合
是你偷走了阿柏！
它在哪儿？你们把它怎么样了？
我拿它做了笔交易
它现在应该已经在永固城了
它就在附近，我能感觉的到
敝人长风，“戴笠”的总领
听说你正在找你的那头野牛
如果找不到它，你一定会很遗憾吧
第二卷
土
第十六章
阿柏走失的日子
不，别再下沉了
可别把我惹急了
给它戴上嚼子
对不起，阿柏
好好搜一下鞍上的东西，没准有点啥值钱的
放心，已经捆得结结实实的了
它伤不了人的
如果被你父亲知道
咱们弄丢了御砂舟该怎么办？
没事的，那艘是咱们从哈米部落顺来的
鞍上的东西都卸下来了吗？
就这点，除了这几件破烂啥也没有
没关系
咱们把它卖给那些甲虫头商人
应该还能换些钱
这厮脾气如何？
相当温顺
呃，他平常不这样的
我敢跟你打赌
永固城肯定会有人出大价钱来买它
好吧，那就成交
阿柏
阿柏
这大包袱现在是你们的了
什么...
给它射一支麝鼠唾液箭
明白
好了，大块头，乖乖地打个盹吧
阿柏
不
不
咱们最好赶紧脱手，这玩艺真是个大麻烦
要不咱们把它剁了卖肉吧
哦，看来最近过得不怎么样啊
小可怜
你也是觉得走投无路
才表现的如此狂暴易怒吧
就象个野兽一样
别担心，野兽一样的生活该结束了
我会好好调教你的
饿了吗？
放心，我也会喂你的
不过不是现在
先得让你知道这儿可没有免费的午餐
当然了，当你表演的时候
那些圈将被点燃
只要你足够小心，就不会被烧到的
看我怎么收拾你
很明显，不管你的前任主人是谁
他肯定不知道该如何正确的驾驭你
我去买一包“咝咝脆”
待在这儿，离那个怪兽远点
老实点，否则有你好看的
这头野牛太难调教
又倔又任性，要训练好它还需些时日
现在让它上场太冒险了
太冒险？你在瞎扯嘛呢？
这个是马戏团，恐惧和危险都是家常便饭
这头野水牛今晚必须上场
如果你不老老实实合作的话
回头烤了你吃牛肉干
咱们走吧
伙计，回头见
女士们，先生们，让你们大开眼界的时候到了
即将上场的是一头无比巨大
十分罕见的神兽
它已经在人们面前消失百余年了
请允许我隆重介绍“野水牛”
起
起，你这头蠢牛
（insolent:粗野的，无礼的）
快跑啊！赶快离开他！
快逃，你能办到的
快回来，你这头蠢牛
好好选啊
飞天野牛将陪伴你一生
呃，看来咱俩要永远在一起了
永远
这有头怪兽
皇叔？
你在看什么呢？
那儿有什么东西吗？
没啥，继续睡吧
这一定发生过激烈的打斗
等等，把那个给我看看
不是吧，该不是
阿柏，噢，不好
没事了，阿柏
我得离开一下，一会就回来帮你
大家的动作不要过大
它已经走失了一段时间
而且好像还受了伤
它比较认生，容易受惊
慢慢的，不要吵
真不敢相信，你找到了神通的野牛
前几天你不是刚见过神通吗？
是啊，所以他肯定不会走的太远
把阿柏安全的交还给神通是我们的责任
这可能是我们接手的最重要的任务了
给它留点空间
阿柏
阿柏，是我啊，苏琪
咱们之前见过
我想帮你
你受伤了，我们可以帮你减轻痛苦
我们还能帮你找到安昂
哎哟哟，没想到得来全不费功夫
真奇怪我的那位皇兄怎么还没抓到你
你到底想怎么样？
你们又是谁，神通的“女粉丝”？
（fan，既扇子，又有爱好者之意）
哦，我晓得了
阿祖拉，还真有你的
看来你们运气不佳啊，神通并不在这儿
我就知道这是在浪费时间
神通不在这儿啊
那倒无所谓，反正神通的朋友都是我的敌人
没事画那么浓的妆，真让我恶心
我们可比你们漂亮多了
原来怕火啊，不错
有谁不怕呢？
快跑，阿柏，飞得越远越好
赶快离开这儿
快逃，你得找到安昂
我们不会有事的
火会越煽越旺的，这点道理都不懂吗？
你好，我是古鲁帕提克
看来我并不是你要找的人
我也没想到刚才能被个大舌头舔来舔去的
世界真是充满了惊喜啊
哦，亲爱的
看来你最近过得不咋样啊
受了伤，又遭到背叛
内心遭到折磨
但你的心中仍然充满着爱
可内心的恐惧让你无法去信任
很久之前，我就在这里等待你和那位年轻的神通
若干年前，我得到了神通需要帮助的启示
所以我才来到东气和寺
你的情绪好似一团乱麻啊
就像暴风雨中翻滚的黑云
让你脑中的乌云消散吧，平静下来
看来休息的不错嘛
把头上的毛都睡乱了
我写了封信需要交给安昂
绑在你角上可以吗？
你和神通神意相通
牢不可分
通过你，我能感知到安昂的去向
有趣吧，我们之间都有着千丝万缕的联系
神兽啊，咱们后会有期

最后的气宗

降世神通 前情提要
火宗人杀了我的父母
那时我才只有八岁
你们好，我叫朱蒂
我们发现在日食日，火宗人将无抵抗之力
永固城的法律十分严明
在城内不允许提战争二字
你们咋看不出来呢
他们是火宗的奸细，你们得相信我
城中没有战争
我们在这儿很安全
我们在这儿很自由
听说你正在找你的野牛
如果找不到它你一定会很失望吧
第二卷

第十七回
劳改湖
我们找了个画师，帮忙完成了海报
嘿，不是说好设计“寻牛启示”是我的任务吗？
为画好阿柏，我都苦练好几天了
索卡，阿柏的箭头是在它的头顶
这就是头
那上面怎么长出脚来了？
那是犄角
我可是有一阵子没看到它了
哪能记得那么清楚
我觉得你画的不错
多谢，我真的很用心...
你那么说是因为可怜我？
咱们还是赶快把专业版的启示贴出去吧
来吧，伙计们，忙活起来吧
你想必就是沏出如此好茶的幕后高手吧
你的茶已经风靡全城了
包掌柜给你开多少工钱啊？
能与好茶为伴就足矣了
倘若同时有高薪在手岂不更妙
想不想拥有自己的茶馆啊？
我自己的茶馆？
那简直是美梦成真啊！
你这是在干啥？
你不是想挖走我的茶艺师吧？
抱歉了包，人往高处走
这个道理谁都明白
木须，如果你愿意留下来
我就升你当助理经理，不
是高级助理经理
我会给你提供一套位于内环的公寓
那间茶馆你可自主经营
完全随你创意
那我可以自己命名茶馆喽？
那当然
呃，高级行政助理经理如何？
侄子，听见了吗？
这位贵人将会在内环给我们开家茶馆
没错，年轻人
你们马上就要发达了
我还真是喜出望外呢
我刚刚把传单发完
有阿柏的消息了吗？
稍安毋躁，才不过一天而已
哇哦，你说的对
不用担心，消息自会送上门
朱蒂？
安昂，卡塔拉，索卡和拓芙，各位好啊
你前几天去哪了？莫非被戴笠关进大牢了？
什么？坐牢？开什么玩笑
戴笠可是我国文化遗产的捍卫者
可是那次土强王的派对之后你就消失了
哦，我只是去劳改湖度了回带薪假期
还是郊外好，真是疗养胜地
可他们之后派了一位也叫朱蒂的人来替换了你
我才是朱蒂
你今天来这儿有何公干啊？
在本城中，未经允许不得
私发传单、粘贴告示
除非是有十分合理的理由
干什么事都要批准，还让不让人活啊？
根据本城律例，不允许你们继续粘贴寻牛启示
去他的狗屁律例吧，我们可不需要你们的准许
我们要自己去找阿柏
识相的就给我滚开
这下你可捅娄子了
小心他们打击报复
我无所谓，为找到阿柏
从现在开始我们要不惜一切代价
耶！咱们就破它几条狗屁律例吧
朱蒂，你对“神通门”事件的处理让我很是失望啊
我原以为你能够控制住事态的发展
十分抱歉，但是他们不再信任我了
恐怕我再也坚持不下去了
朱蒂，土强王邀请你去劳改湖
能接受到他的邀请是我的荣幸
很好
下去吧，随时待命
如果神通继续寻找它的野牛的话
将会颠覆我们苦心经营的城市平衡
没准还会导致失去对土强王的控制
要我们去干掉他吗？
不了，正面与他交锋过于危险
也许仍然有暗渡陈仓的办法
你看，我正在为我的新茶馆想名字
“茉莉之龙”咋样？
既戏剧化，又有诗意
我很中意
神通就在永固城中，他丢了那头野牛
我们有机会在这里另觅新生
如果你又开始找麻烦
这些来之不易的好事都将化为泡影
那些只是你的好事罢了
你有没有想过，我对生活的渴望远不止
一幢好公寓或是一份茶艺师的工作
享受和平而繁荣的生活并没有什么好的啊
我建议你仔细考虑一下
你到底需要什么样的生活
还有为什么需要？
我要完成我的使命
看你自己如何把握吧
叫“茶虫居”
不行，这名字太蠢了
咱们最好分头行动
这样张贴的范围还能大些
拓芙，不如你跟我一队吧
为啥？难道你们不相信我能自己贴告示？
贴反了是吗？
我还是跟索卡一队好了
卡塔拉
我想我能帮助你
卡塔拉，我变了
杰，拿那些谎话去哄其他女孩吧
我不是来打架的，我是来帮忙的
卡塔拉，出什么事了？
杰回来了
我们再也不能相信杰的那些鬼话了
我们甚至都不知道他为什么会出现在这儿
不管他为什么来这儿
反正不会是什么好原因
我来这儿是为了帮你们找阿柏的
卡塔拉，我们应该给他一个机会
我保证，我已经变了
我曾是个惹是生非的人
无法控制住自己的愤怒
我现在已经不拉帮结伙了
那都已经是前尘往事了
你在说谎
他没说谎
你怎么知道？
我可以感觉到他的呼吸和心跳
人在说谎的时候，呼吸和心跳将会发生变化
他说的是实话
卡塔拉，我们还没有任何线索
既然杰说他能带我们找到阿柏
我们不妨一试
那好吧...
我们会盯紧你的，少耍花样
这就是我听说的地方
这儿啥也没有
如果这是个陷阱...
我跟你说过了，我在附近打工
我听见两个人在谈论说他们
有个巨大的毛怪，我想那应该就是阿柏
它的确来过这儿
我们错过了
他们昨天把那个大东西运走了
好象是用船运到某个岛去，说起时间来
我在这儿打扫这些杂毛和...
呃，和一些残留物都已经一整天了
什么岛？他们把阿柏运到哪儿去了？
领班说鲸尾岛的一位富绅把它买下了
没准要送进动物园展览
要我说，还不如杀了烤肉吃
我们应该赶往鲸尾岛
鲸尾岛在哪儿？
远，那是相当远
在这儿，在南极附近，都快到家了
安昂，可能要花数周的时间才能到达土强国的港口
之后我们还得找艘船才能出发
那无所谓
只要有机会能找到阿柏
我们就要试一下
你去个小岛度假真是不错啊
我都好几年没去度假了
你不是还有很多杂毛没清理干净呢吗？
卸磨杀驴啊，小白眼狼
不需要“老扫帚”就撂一边了
你说的对，安昂，现在找到阿柏是当务之急
等找到它后，可以让它载我们回来
那好，咱们这就出发吧
我跟你们一道去
我们不需要你的帮忙
为什么你就是不肯相信我?
呀，我也想知道呢
这人该不会是你的男朋友吧？
啥？当然不是
你骗不了我，你在说谎~
我们可以坐火车出城，不过之后我们就要步行了
别担心，回来时咱们可以用飞的
终于要离开永固城了
最烂之城
杰
你不是说你已经不拉帮结伙了吗？
我是没有啊
我们可担心你了
你是怎么从戴笠那儿逃出来的？
“戴笠”？
我不知道她在说什么
几个星期前，他被戴笠逮捕了
我们亲眼看见他被拖走了
我怎么会被抓呢？我进城之后一向安分守己
没道理啊，他们都没有说谎
这不可能
不，可能
如果他们说得都是实话
拓芙又怎么能说出谁在说谎
杰被洗脑了
这太疯狂了，怎么会
离我远点
别挡路，芦柴棒
如果你不想和他一个下场
就乖乖的跟我合作
戴笠肯定是想派杰来误导咱们
估计那个清洁工也是他们的同谋
我敢打赌他们一定把阿柏关在城中
也许和关押杰的是同一个地方
他们当初把你关在哪儿？
啥，我根本不知道你们在说啥
我们应该找个办法唤醒他真实的记忆
也许可以让卡塔拉亲他一下
没准他就什么都想起来了
你咋不去亲他呢，索卡
嘿，只是提个建议嘛
狗嘴吐不出象牙
哦，等等，我有主意了
看来你是在白费功夫，呸
试着去想想能够勾起你情感的往事
比如火宗人，还记得他们
是如何对待你的家人的吗？
闭上眼，好好想想
不！那太痛苦了
也许这能让你好过些
他们把我带到一个水下的秘密总部
好像是在个湖下面
等等，记得朱蒂说过
她说她去劳改湖度假了
没错，就是劳改湖
那么，那个秘密总部在哪儿？
我想应该就在湖下面
在湖岸边就有条隧道
我现在都想起来了
我叫朱蒂，欢迎来到永固城
我叫朱蒂，欢迎来到永固城
城墙让我们的城市井井有条
城墙让我们的城市井井有条
我想前面肯定有个足够大的牢房关着阿柏
我想没准就在这儿
没想到会是我吧？
和我想象的有点差距
你们现在已经是国家公敌了
把他们给我抓起来
长风跑了
神通，我已经受够你了
如果你还想见到你的野牛，就乖乖跟我合作
果然是你抓了阿柏，快说它在哪儿？
如果你答应立即离城
我就免除对你的所有指控
并且将你的野牛物归原主
你可没资格跟我们讨价还价
是吗？
那还用说
杰，土强王邀请你去劳改湖
能接受到他的邀请我很荣幸
你现在是我的了
皇叔？
这不是蓝魔吗
我一直都很好奇你到底是谁呢？
你来这里干嘛？
我还要问你呢
如今你找到了神通的野牛
下一步你要做何打算？
继续关在你的新公寓里？
我是不是也应该给它准备一壶茶呢?
离开这儿再说
然后呢？
你从来都没有仔细考虑过这些事情
在北极抓到神通之后你也是这样
你抓到了他，可是不知道该去哪里
我总会想出来的
瞎说！如果不是他的朋友找到你们
你估计早就被冻死了
皇叔，我知道自己的使命
那真是你自己的使命？还是某人强加给你的使命？
别说了，皇叔，我别无选择
我求你了，祖寇殿下
是时候该扪心自问，拷问自己这些关键问题了
你到底是谁？你要的究竟是什么？
杰，我是安昂啊！
你不需要这么做的
恐怕他没有别的选择
杰，我是你的朋友，听听你内心的声音
杰，完成你的使命
他不能强迫你做这些
你可是名自由战士
杀了他！现在就杀了他！
傻孩子，你这是在自寻灭亡
对不起，安昂
不是你的错
伤势很重
你们去找阿柏吧，我们会照顾好杰的
我们不会丢下你们不管的
时间不多了，快去
我们会照顾好他的，他是我们的头
别担心卡塔拉，我不会有事的
他在说谎
阿柏不在了
长风还是早了我们一步
如果我们继续追的话，还能追得上
你觉得咱们能甩掉他们吗？
应该不成问题
怎么了，模模？
阿柏
我一个人就能摆平你
耶，阿柏
你可让我想死了，伙计
皇侄，你做出了正确的选择
就让往事随风吧

降世神通 前情提要
火会越煽越旺的，这道理你都不懂吗？
敝人长风，戴笠的总领
为什么你不让我们觐见国王
土强王可没有闲功夫浪费在政治争斗上
这么说土强王只是个傀儡？
他只是你手中的玩偶
是时候该扪心自问，拷问自己这些关键问题了
你到底是谁？你要的究竟是什么？

你可把我给想死了，伙计
第二卷
土
第十八回
土强王
伙计，你都不知道我有多么的想你
你看，咱们从戴笠的魔爪下
死里逃生，又找回了阿柏
依我看，咱们应该现在就去找
土强王，告诉他咱们的计划
咱们现在多顺啊
这才是多大点的胜利啊
咱们之前可是接连倒霉了几个星期
我们只能寄希望于他
如果我们想要在日食那天侵入烈火国的话
我们需要土强王的兵力支持
你怎么知道他会答应呢？
你们可能也都发现了
咱们几个好像都挺衰的
即便如此，我仍然觉得前途大好
这次会一帆风顺的
索卡，长风仍然控制着都城
有戴笠的支持，他的阴谋势力仍然很强大
我想还是赶紧飞离这个鬼地方吧
我赞成“好好小姐”的建议
我再也不想见到永固城了，即便我本来就看不见
可是我们现在已经把阿柏找回来了
没有什么能阻止我们将真相告诉土强王
他有权知道那些阴谋和战争
看看，安昂也赞同我
别忘了这是咱们来这儿的首要任务
我们得试一下
那个，我想如果土强王知道
真相的话，局势将会有所转变
我可不相信这个乐观的新索卡
长风也把你给洗脑了，对吧？
那可能是戴笠
他们肯定正在搜寻我们，怎么办？
咱们飞吧
咱们能买个新鞍子吗？
就这么飞简直太吓人了
就在那儿，那一片就是皇宫了
土强王的宫殿应该就在正中心
咱们得小心点
长风可能已经警告土强王咱们要来
你瞎寻思嘛呀？
要我说，咱们肯定能直飞...啊
那是什么？
地对空岩石弹，越来越多了
抱歉
对不起，我们只是想过去觐见土强王
说真的，咱们其实是同一战线的
抱歉了
里面就是了
拓芙，找土强王该走哪条路？
你问我我问谁去？
我离开永固城时还不记事呢
-有刺客！
-抱歉，走错门了
（Burglar: 窃贼）
这件事你做的对，放走神通的野牛是明智之举
我有点难受
这门看起来就很气派
就是它没错了
你不能先打个招呼啊
我们需要跟您谈谈
他们来这儿是想谋朝篡位
才不是，咱们是同一战线的
我们来这儿是想帮助您
您得相信我们
你们硬闯入我的皇宫
撂倒我的侍卫，弄坏我华丽的殿门
还指望着我相信你们？
他说得很在理
如果想证明你们的诚意
就放下武器，然后退下
看吧，我们是朋友，尊敬的陛下
把这些刺客给我拿下
我们都已经放下武器了
我们可是您的同盟啊
确保神通和他的朋友们都见不到明天的太阳
降世神通？
你就是神通？
我不是，是他
在这儿呢
是神通又怎么样？他们可是国家公敌
也许你是对的
既然波斯科喜欢他
就给他一个说话的机会吧
陛下，城外有一场战争正在进行
事实上，这战争已经持续百年之久了
戴笠向您隐瞒了这一切
并阴谋掌控整座城市以及您的一举一动
有我不知道的战争？真是无稽之谈
全是胡扯
长风不想让我们告诉您真相
所以他偷走了我们的飞天野牛，以便勒索我们
他不光勒索我们，还把我们的朋友给洗脑了
一派胡言，陛下
我从来都没见过什么飞天野牛
老实说，我以为它们都已经灭绝了
即便你是降世神通
你的申辩也很难让人信服
这些小流氓是无政府组织的一支
我手下的特工已经跟踪他们数周了
如果你听信了他们的谗言
那无疑是自寻死路
我不得不相信我的顾问
且慢，我能证明他在说谎
长风说他从未见过飞天野牛
那好，让他卷起他的左裤腿
啥？在大殿上赤身裸体成何体统？
就在那儿！是被阿柏咬的
从没见过飞天野牛，是吗？
那是一块大胎记罢了
谢你啊，现在大家都知道了
我想没有方法能证明那印迹从何而来
当然有办法
没错，的确相当吻合
好耶
不过那并不能证明你们所说的阴谋理论
尽管如此，我想这仍然值得进一步调查
-好吧   -说得在理
-是啊   -那好吧
你的额头都烫手了
你这回烧的真够厉害的
用这帮你降降温吧
好渴啊
这有干净的水，喝点吧
盖好被子，冒冒汗就好了
哦，原来火车就长这样啊
我没想到会这样...公开化
这么说您从来都没出过内环喽
我从未出过皇宫
那么飞着旅行才叫爽哩
那个，能问一下我们要去哪吗？
陛下，我们将去劳改湖
那湖下有戴笠的秘密总部
在那您就能亲眼目睹洗脑和
其他阴谋是如何进行的
被毁了
哦，不是吧
没关系，我仍然很乐观
戴笠肯定知道我们会来
所以销毁了证据
嗯，这实在没法叫人信服
嘿，这恰恰证明他们
还有很多不可告人的阴谋
长风说得没错，这简直就是在浪费时间
请原谅，我要打道回宫了
对了，城墙！他们肯定来不及修复的
如果您跟我们去外城
我们能向您证明那场秘密的战争是真实的
历代土强王都未去过外城
我可没闲工夫听你们瞎扯
如果您跟我们去
我可以让您骑阿柏
第一次飞吧？
我是又兴奋又害怕
是啊，我也恨透飞行了
跟你们说实在的
我真的很希望你们
跟我说的那场战争并不存在
我又何尝不是呢
为时不早了
吾皇是否准备好要退位了呢？
我还不累
放松，烈火王祖寇
放手吧，屈从吧
就让你的眼睛闭上一会儿吧
不，烈火王祖寇！
别听蓝龙的谗言
你应该赶快离开这儿
快走，要不然就太晚了
快睡吧，烈火王祖寇
睡吧，就像母后那样
祖寇，救我啊！
它还在那儿
那是什么？
那是个钻头，是烈火国制作的巨钻
专门用来钻透您的城墙的
真不敢相信我居然都不知道
请容我解释，陛下
不必大惊小怪的，不过是个建筑工程罢了
是嘛，那么请问为什么你们
的建筑工程上会有烈火国的徽章呢？
那个，这项目是进口的
你也知道国内的机械水平不怎么样的
您不会相信这些毛孩子吧
我可是您最器重的御用随从啊
戴笠，逮捕长风
将他以叛国罪收押，等待受审
你们不能抓我
没有我你们可怎么活啊
看来长风以后只能在监狱里喝西北风了
哈...哦，耶，
这笑话我已经想了很久了
我要谢谢你们大家
你们这群英雄少年打开了我的眼界
我一直引以为傲的大都会
只不过是一座庸人之城罢了
而我更是庸人之首
我们正处于烈火国挑起的战事之中
陛下，这正是我们造访永固城的原因
我们认为您能帮助我们结束这场战争
我们的时间不多了
夏天将有颗彗星来临
它的能量将给予火宗不可估量的力量
那时他们将不可战胜
不过仍有希望，在彗星到来之前
我们有个机会可以取得胜利
将会有日食发生
那天太阳将被月亮完全遮住
火宗人将无抵抗之力
索卡，你有什么建议
我们应该在那天侵入烈火国
让我们来一场黑日反击
不好吧，那将需要撤出永固城所有的部队
永固城也将毫无抵抗之力
永固城已经是火宗的攻击对象了
永固城一日不灭，烈火国是不会善罢甘休的
你可以坐以待毙，也可以奋起反击
不如给自己一个抗击的机会吧
好吧，我会全力支持你们的
-太好了
-好耶   -合作愉快！
陛下
抱歉打搅您
这位是郝将军，他是五人协会的统领
我手下的头号大将军
我们奉命搜查了长风的府邸
找到了一些大家都很感兴趣的东西
这是永固城中所有人的秘密文件
当然也有这些孩子的
秘密文件？
北方拓芙
是你母亲的来信
你妈妈就在城中，她想要见你
长风截下了我们的家信？
真是不知廉耻
安昂，在你的野牛被抓住时
这封信绑在它犄角上
这封信来自东气和寺
请问有给我和索卡的信吗？
好像没有
不过这有一条情报，你们可能会感兴趣
一支水族的小舰队？
啥？那有可能是老爸他们
这支舰队由哈库达领导
戍守变色龙湾的入口，那不就是老爸吗

你得的可不是什么常见的疾病
不过喝点茶应该不会碍事的
怎么了，发生什么事了？
在湖下的时候
你作出了艰难的抉择
你与自己的另一面展开了殊死搏斗
这场搏斗仍在你的意志和身体中继续
那是什么意思？
我的皇侄，现在的你就像在蜕变一样
也许蜕变的过程并不好过
不过一旦破茧成蝶
你将会成为一名真正英俊的王子
真不敢相信，居然有个人
生活在东气和寺，他说他是位古鲁
啥是古鲁？是一种有毒的河豚鱼？
不是，古鲁是通晓灵学的专家
他想帮助我继续下阶段神通的修行
他说他能教我如何掌握神通形态
我们居然知道老爸的下落了
我了解你的感受
我母亲就在城中
看信中所写，她最终还是理解了我
这些都是大好的消息
咱们应该从哪件事开始呢？
我不想这么说，不过我们得分头行动了
分开？我们刚刚找到阿柏
大家也才重聚
为什么现在就要分开？
你得去见那个古鲁，安昂
如果我们要进攻烈火国，你应该做好准备
好吧，如果我去东气和寺的话
可以捎你们去变色龙湾见父亲
需要留下个人跟土强王一起制定进攻计划
还是我留下吧
不，索卡，我知道你很想去帮老爸
你就去变色龙湾吧，我留在这陪土强王
你...
真是...世界上...最好的...妹妹
别这样，哥哥
不过你说的对，我的确是最好的
卡塔拉，我有几句话要跟你说
其实好久之前就想跟你说了
什么话，安昂？
卡塔拉，我...
好喽！准备好开始我们的兄弟之旅了吗？
安昂，索卡，祝你们一路顺风
永固城的人民感谢你们
我们期待着你们的归来
陛下 ，有三位女武士想要求见
她们自称是来自于虚子岛的武士
是苏琪
你认识她们？
哦，当然，虚子武士是一群武艺精湛
且值得信赖的战士，她们是我们的好朋友
我一定会将她们待为上宾的
等等，安昂
-我会很想念你们的
-我也是
好了，够了，好吧
我们是相亲相爱的一家人，真的
看吧，安昂，乐观的想法可以创造奇迹
我们得到了土强王的支持，逮捕了长风
等我们回来，苏琪会在那里等我
是啊，姑娘们在等咱们呢
谢了，“乐观态度”
从此以后将会事事顺利的，直到永远
您的晚饭
五人协会和军队听命于土强王
不过戴笠将永远听您差遣，长风大人
嘿，妈妈，有人在吗？
嘿！你们知道老子是谁吗？
离家出走的大嗓门小屁孩儿呗
在我们最需要帮助的时候
我们热切的欢迎尊敬的同盟到访
欢迎你们虚子武士
我们是您谦卑的仆人
-=未完待续=-

水善国
土强国
火烈国
气和国
很久以前，这四大国和谐共处
然而，烈火国发起的战争结束了和平
只有同时掌握四种元素的降世神通才能结束战争
然而在大家最需要他的时候，他却消失了
年后，我和哥哥发现了转世的降世神通，
他是个御气师，名叫“安昂”
尽管他的御气术着实厉害
在拯救苍生之前，他要学的还有很多
但是我坚信
安昂 能拯救这个世界
-=降世神通=-
最后的气宗

降世神通 前情提要
居然有个人生活在东气和寺
他说他能教我掌握神通形态
我怎么了？
我的皇侄，现在的你正在经历一次蜕变
戴笠将永远听候您的差遣，长风大人
有人在吗？
虚子武士，欢迎你们的到来
我们是您谦卑的仆人

第二卷
土
第十九章
古鲁
那是什么味啊？
糨糊粥
你肯定不会喜欢的
咋会呢，闻起来就很好吃
皇叔，给我盛一碗吧
你应该退烧了吧，怎么感觉你有点不一样
这是新的一天
我们有了新公寓
置办了新家具，而且
今天还是您的茶馆开张大吉的好日子
皇叔，是好兆头啊
已经两年没见到你父亲了吧
你肯定贼激动，是不？
我应该激动的，对吧
不过我怎么感到胃有点不舒服
别太紧张了，能见到你他肯定也高兴极了
你怎么样？
要去见古鲁，是不是也很紧张？
一点也不，不掌握好神通形态
我誓不罢休
一周后见，驾，驾
索卡，你咋来了
索卡！
好啊，老爸！
我说波斯科，虚子武士是来保护咱们的
你是不是很激动啊？
我这周真是祸事不断啊
我最信任的顾问，长风
和他统领的戴笠居然企图谋朝篡位
最亲近的人却不能信任
这真是太可怕了
不过也有好消息
就在现在
五人议会正在制定
今夏入侵烈火国的作战计划
就在日食那天
真的吗？
真是绝顶妙计啊
冯将军的基地将作为进攻的发射点
两个月后的今天，陆军和海军将同时侵入烈火国
代号为“黑日行动”
不如我们派模模
去搞些破坏行动吧，你看它...
抱歉
万事俱备，只需土强王合金印批准了
我立刻就向吾皇上呈计划
谢谢你，郝将军
你好
你就是古鲁帕提克吧
阿柏角上绑着的信是你发的吧
没错，我与气宗有着千丝万缕的联系
雅俗大师和我更是私交很深
你在信中说可以传授我
掌握神通形态的方法
要怎么做？
在重复天下平衡之前
你先要平和自己的内心
第一步就从这开始吧
干了它
喝起来像是洋葱香蕉汁
没错
我觉得咱们应该向右拐
别胡扯了
北方家的府邸应该在这个方向
肯定是你搞错了
你们两个老太太就不能消停一会吗？
我想上厕所
好吧，不过得快点
你脑袋进水了？
哦，拓芙你可真是狡猾狡猾地哟
不过想骗大爷我，你还嫩点
可别让我出去
否则打得你俩屁股开花
别白费力气了
即便你是世上最厉害的御土师
你拿金属也没辙
姑娘们，现在是我们的绝佳时机
对，赶快卸妆
省得梅总是愁眉苦脸的
我说的是拿下整个土强国
咱们烈火国已经在永固城外觊觎了几百年了
如今我们已在永固城之内
我们可以亲手将其颠覆
唉，你还真镇定，我对你的钦佩
真如滔滔江水连绵不绝啊
在城内我们可以出其不意
一举推倒土强王的政权
关键就在于戴笠
得戴笠者，得永固城
你只有打通所有脉轮，才能够掌握神通形态
（Chakra，脉轮，火影中所说的查克拉）
安昂，谈谈你对脉轮的了解
脉轮是嘛啊？
哦，我晓得了，看来咱们要从基础开始
你身体中能量的流动
正如这小溪中的水流一样
你会发现在溪水向前流淌之前
水会在这种小池中回旋
我们的轮脉就像这些小池一样
这么说，脉轮就是我们体中能量回旋之地
答对
倘若溪中无杂物，溪水将一路纯净前行
然而，生活就是一团麻
溪水中不免会有些异物
你说那会怎样呢？
溪水不能流动了？
对头
不过只要我们打通了池与池间的通路
能量就会随意流动
人体中共有七个脉轮
每一个能量池都有自己的用途
会被不同的情绪污物堵塞
要记住
打开脉轮会对你有强烈的影响
一旦开始，七个脉轮
全部打开后才能停止
准备好了吗？
我会竭尽全力的
首先我们要打开的是“土脉轮”
它位于你的脊椎骨底
由生存意识掌控
被你的恐惧所阻塞
你最害怕的是什么？
让你的恐惧呈现在你的眼前
安昂
那些只是幻境而已
我知道你为生存而忧
但是你必须放弃这些恐惧
让你的恐惧随溪水流走吧
你已经打开了“土脉轮”
下一个是...
“水脉轮”？
聪明！没准有朝一日
你也能成为一名古鲁
“水脉轮”由快乐掌控
但是易被愧疚感阻塞
现在，面对你所有的愧疚
你为什么要责怪自己？
我跑掉了
是我伤害了那些人民
接受这些已经发生的现实吧
别让他们遮蔽并荼毒你的能量
如果你想正面的引导这个世界
你要学会宽恕自己
这座海湾直通永固城的郊外
我们用这些“纠结水雷”来阻止火宗的舰船通过
这些“纠结水雷”是你父亲自己发明的
威力很大，浮力强，而且...
...臭死人不偿命
观察的很敏锐嘛
这水雷里面填满了臭鼬鼠鱼和海藻
一旦船只撞上破他们
海藻就会缠上螺旋桨
而散发出的恶臭会令他们弃船
我叫它“臭沉弹”
（Stink &amp; sink ：臭且沉，还押韵呢~）
真有你的，老爸
真是有其父必有其子
哈库达，我们侦察兵发现了四艘火宗舰船
巴图，把这些水雷装上船
其他人，准备作战
老爸，我该干点嘛？
没听见吗？我说其他人准备作战
我们刚来时还是流浪汉呢
谁料到我居拥然有了自己的茶馆
黄天不负有心人啊，祖寇
祝贺你，叔叔
我真的很感激啊
这是你应得的，“茉莉龙”将是全城最好的茶馆
不是，我感激地是
你能陪我一同度过这特别的一天
这对我意义非凡
咱们开始给客人们做茶吧
好喽！开工开工！
第三个脉轮就是“火脉轮”
它就位于你的胃中
我的“火脉轮”想吃点别的东西
最好不是洋葱香蕉汁
这时还搞笑，继续
“火脉轮”关乎你的力量
会被你的羞愧阻塞
你对何事感到羞愧？
你对自己做的哪件事最失望？
我再也不用御火术了
不能再用了
如果你不能完全认同自己
你将永远也找不到平衡
你是降世神通
因此你必是一名御火师
这个脉轮打开时并不像小溪淌水
更像是野牛打嗝
有洋葱和香蕉的味道，好像还有其他的...
泡菜？
这身行头我真是穿够了
怎么可能有人穿它来打仗
也难怪我们能这么轻易的打败她们
还抢来了这身衣服
我们还要服侍那个土强王多久？
如果再让我清理那些熊粪
我就要吐了
阿祖拉公主向我们保证
只要抓住神通我们就可以回国了
稍安勿躁
小声点！
害怕别人不知道咱们是火宗人啊？
对不起
干的好，姑娘们
戴笠一定会去通风报信的
第四个“脉轮”位于你的心脏
它与爱相关，易被悲伤阻塞
让你所有的忧伤呈现面前
你的确有巨大的伤悲
不过爱将给予你力量
它将围绕着你
气宗对你的爱仍未消失
它就在你的心中，不如将其转化成为新爱
让痛随风而逝
非常好
我能再喝点洋葱香蕉汁吗？
第五个脉轮位于咽喉，即为“声脉轮”
其由真相掌控，易被谎言阻塞
自欺欺人的谎言
你之前为什么不说你就是神通
因为我从来都不想当神通
你不能欺骗你的本性
你必须接受你是神通的事实
非常好，安昂
你已经打开了“真相脉轮”
第六个能量池是“光明脉轮”
其位于你的前额
其由你的洞察力掌控
易被幻觉阻塞
这世界最大的幻觉就是分离
我们认为互相孤立的事物
往往是一个统一的整体，就像...
就像这四大国
没错
我们都是一奶同胞，只不过分散居住而已
我们都是相互联系的
万物皆相连
没错，四种元素相生相克的现象
其实也是一种幻想
解放你的思想，你会发现
四种元素其实是一个统一的整体
四素归一，就连金属也是土的一部分
只不过是被提纯精炼了而已
破铁块，给我开
拓芙，你棒透了
我说模模，咱们在去见皇上之前喝杯茶怎样？
我要个两人桌
叔叔，两杯茉莉花茶
一杯绿茶，一杯荔枝茶
稍等，我这就沏好
这是最后一个脉轮了吧
没错，一旦你打开这个脉轮
你就可以随心所欲的出入神通形态
而且在神通形态中
你可以完全掌控自己的行为
那就开始吧
“思之脉轮”位于头冠处
它由纯净的宇宙能量所控制
却易被凡世牵挂所阻塞
仔细考虑一下你在这世上的牵绊吧
现在，放开所有的牵挂吧
让它们随波漂逝
忘记吧
什么？为什么你让我忘记卡塔拉
可我...我...我爱她啊
不忘记她，那纯净的宇宙能量
又怎能流入你的体内呢
宇宙能量难道比卡塔拉更重要吗？
我喜欢她又怎么能算是一件坏事呢？
在打开三个脉轮之前，还是件好事呢
你必须学会放手
还好你在这儿，苏琪，大事不好了
火宗人混入了都城
我刚才看到了祖寇和他的叔叔
我们得立刻上报土强王
哦，别担心，我一定会通知他的
这么说，祖祖也在城中喽
该是一家团聚的时候了
我很抱歉，不过我不会放你走的，卡塔拉
安昂，要掌握神通状态
你必需打开所有的脉轮
学会放下自我
好吧，我尽力而为
现在，面对你的那些牵绊
试着放弃它们
让纯净的宇宙能量流入
放我走！
卡塔拉有危险，我必须走
安昂，回来
如果继续痴迷于那些牵绊
脉轮将被封闭
如果你现在离开，你将不能进入神通形态
这肯定又是她在耍花招
箱子上都破了这么一个大洞
你见过这样的花招吗？
当然不是了
我可是来真的
我是这世上最厉害的御土师
你们两个笨蛋给我记住了
莫非我要跟你永远困在这儿了
我想上厕所
准备好去大败火宗了吗？
老爸，你不知道这对我有多重要
我会让你以我为傲的，
我要向您证明我是一名伟大的武士
索卡，你不用向我证明，我一直都以你为傲
我一直都认为你是名伟大的武士
真的吗？
不然我为何在走后把全部落都托付给你？
看来大事不妙
怎么回事？为什么你的部下大半夜的押我至此
你们不能这么对待虚子武士
可你又不是虚子武士
你好啊，烈火国的阿祖拉公主
你想怎样？
我想做个交易
该是我重掌永固城大权的时候了
而你有我要的东西
土强王的信任
我为什么要帮你？
因为我可以帮你抓到神通
洗耳恭听
皇上有旨
我...我不敢相信
上面写了什么，叔叔？
好消息
土强王邀请我们进宫奉茶
-=未完待续=-

水善国
土强国
火烈国
气和国
很久以前，这四大国和谐共处
然而，烈火国发起的战争结束了和平
只有同时掌握四种元素的降世神通才能结束战争
然而在大家最需要他的时候，他却消失了

最后的气宗

降世神通 前情提要
感觉你好像有点不一样
真是个好兆头啊，皇叔
在城内我们可以出其不意
一举推倒土强王的政权
戴笠是关键
我想做笔交易
如果你想掌握神通状态
你必须打开所有的脉轮
卡塔拉有危险，我必须得走
安昂，别走
如果你在神通状态时被杀死
降世神通将不复存在
第二卷
土
第二十回
（第二卷 最终回）
命运的岔路口
我说，卡塔拉到底遇到了什么麻烦？
我不知道，我只是预见到她需要我们的帮助
如果神通的预知能力能够与时俱进
变得精准点就更好了
那是什么东西？
要搭顺风“牛”吗？
土强王和五人议会都不信任戴笠
他们抓了你们的总领，长风大人
收拾你们只是迟早的事
时至今日，掌握实权是关乎我们命运的大事
我们的行动必须快且准
这样才能出其不意
土强王和其他五位将军必须同时拿下
这次颠覆行动，长风大人让我全权处理
如果让我知道你们有任何不忠、
犹豫或者胆怯的举动
我定当格杀勿论
收队吧
阿祖拉，真有你的，你讲的既漂亮又有诗意
还很有震慑力呢
是啊，我想其中一个都让你给吓得尿裤子了
我们还有一些收尾工作要做
要收拾掉神通，还有我的皇兄和皇叔
我时常梦想自己能来到这儿
来到这宫殿的门槛之前
在幻想中，我应是个征服者的形象，没料到
我们是作为土强王的客人到此
并且还要给他奉茶
命运真爱捉弄人啊
可不是嘛，皇叔
你在古鲁那儿怎么样？掌握好神通形态了吗？
如果你现在离开，你将不能进入神通形态
安昂，你还好吗?
挺好的
我跟古鲁相处的很好
我已经完全掌握神通状态了
皇上怎么还没来啊？
没准土强王睡过头了
事有蹊跷
品茶时间到了
阿祖拉
你们已经见过戴笠了吧？
他们都是御土师，可却拥有御火师般的杀手天分
简直就是为我定做的
不知道我的外号叫“西方神龙”吗？
皇叔，我对你那些又臭又长的故事不感兴趣
我可不是浪得虚名
快跳，不会有事的
不，我已经厌倦逃跑了
这次我要跟阿祖拉来个了断
你还真是感情用事啊
你要干嘛，想在烈火祭上挑战我吗？
没错
我要和你决斗
我可没兴趣
卡塔拉没事，你们没有必要担心
不过我预感到她好像出事了
呃，她与议会的将军们商讨侵入的作战计划之后
就和虚子武士离开了
她们不是你们的朋友吗？
看吧，安昂，她跟苏琪在一起
她们没准已经回公寓唠嗑去了
好吧，没准你是对的
相信我，如果有危险的话，波斯科能感觉得到
动物的直觉最准了
你有伴了
祖寇
模模
这儿没有人
卡塔拉有麻烦了，我就知道
哦，糟了
等等，有人来了
事实上，我知道来人是谁
是我的一位老朋友
看到你没事了，真好
我需要你们的帮忙
你们俩居然认识
我们在森林里有过一面之缘
我当时把他撞倒了
之后他给我茶喝，还给了我很好的建议
我能进来吗？
阿祖拉在永固城
卡塔拉肯定是被她抓走了
她也抓走了我皇侄
那我们就合伙斗阿祖拉吧
把卡塔拉和祖寇给救出来
喔，等等，你是说救祖寇？
我知道你们怎么看我的皇侄
不过请相信我，他也有好的一面
光有好的一面有什么用？
他那坏得一面已经害得我们好惨了
卡塔拉有危险，整个永固城都很危险
只有协同作战，我们才有胜算
我还带了个人，他应该能帮到咱们
阿祖拉和长风正打在筹划叛乱
他们想推翻土强王
他们把我妹妹、卡塔拉关哪儿了?
他们被关在老永固城的水晶地陵中，就在皇宫下面
所有的将军和土强王都将按计划一步步地除去
很好，那位烈火国公主合作吗？
哦，是的，她不只是合作
现在都已经全权接管了
她态度令人畏惧，不过却很鼓舞士气
这种感觉很难说清楚
他们为什么把你关在这儿？
哦，等等，让我猜猜，这是个陷阱
当安昂来救我时，你就可以趁机偷袭抓住他
你可真是坏得冒泡了，你说说你
总是跟着我们，追捕神通
试图消灭使世界恢复和平的最后希望
你当然不会在乎了，你可是烈火王之子
宣扬战争和暴力是你的本职
憎恨一直流淌在你的血液之中
你根本就不知道自己在说些什么
我不知道？真是大言不惭！
你知道这战争从我身上夺走了什么？
只剩下孤零零的我
火宗人夺走了我妈妈的生命
我很抱歉
你的痛我能感同身受
你们猜怎么着
这下面的确有座古城，不过埋的很深
我们分头行动吧，安昂
你和艾洛去救卡塔拉和那个愤青
我这么说你不介意吧
我不会放在心上的
我和拓芙去找土强王戳穿阿祖拉的阴谋
那个，拓芙说你曾给她很好的建议
你泡的茶也很好喝
诀窍就在于泡茶的时间
你在烦心什么？
那个，我去见了个古鲁
他说能帮我掌握神通形态
让我学会如何控制那股巨大的力量
不过若要修成正果，只有放弃我所爱的人
我就是做不到
所谓的完美和力量都是身外之物
我想你选择幸福和爱情是明智之举
如果我不能拯救所有人并战败阿祖拉该怎么办？
如果不能使用神通形态
我得力量不足以完成使命该怎么办？
我也不知道答案
有时生活就像这条黑暗的隧道
隧道的尽头不可能永远都有明灯指路
不过只要你不断前行
总会到达更好的地方的
那是郝将军
你们要干嘛？
我们奉命将您软禁
他们正在实行颠覆行动
我们得去警告土强王
太好了，幸好还来的及
来的及干嘛？
是啊，你要来得及干嘛啊？
帅哥？
嗯，我已经名草有主了，跟苏琪
跟谁？
她们不是虚子武士
抱歉让你失望了
咱们好像在一起跳舞啊
不用打了，已经分清胜负了
把他们给我带走
抱歉我欺骗了你
戴笠，把烈火国公主给我拿下
我说，把她拿下
你们愣在那儿干嘛？
因为他们还没下定决心
他们在等着看后面的好戏呢
你在说什么胡话？
从你的眼睛就可以把你看穿
你生来就一无所有
所以你拼命挣扎、不惜代价的爬上仕途
不过你确是具备登基称皇的能力
实际上，他们不确定皇冠将会带在谁的头上
而谁又会成为阶下囚
不过我知，你也知
怎样
没想到我居然在自己的游戏中输给了你
别抬举自己了
这场游戏你根本就没有玩的资格
抱歉我之前冲你嚷嚷
没关系
只不过一直以来，一提到敌人
我眼前浮现的就是你的脸
我的脸，我明白了
不，不，我不是那个意思
没关系，我脸上的疤已经成为我的标志了
那是被驱逐的王子的标志
是要永远追逐神通的诅咒
不过最近，我意识到
我可以自由选择自己的命运
尽管我脸上的伤疤永远也消除不掉了
也许我可以帮你
真的？
我有治愈的能力
那可是疤，治不好的
这水来自于北极的灵洲
它有特殊的功效
所以我一直留着它以备不时之需
虽然我还不知道它是否有效，不过...
安昂！
安昂，我就知道你会来救我的
皇叔，你怎么会和神通在一起？
当然是为了救你啊
祖寇，咱俩该好好聊聊了
去帮你们的朋友吧
我们随后就来
为什么，皇叔？
祖寇，你已经不是原来的你了
你比以前更强壮，更聪慧，更自由
现在你正站在命运的岔路口上
是时候该作出选择了，是时候该弃暗投明了
我早就料到皇叔会背叛火宗的
不过祖寇，祖寇王子殿下
你并不一样，你绝不是个叛徒
对吧？
赶快放了他！
祖寇，现在还为时不晚
你还可以将功赎罪
她分明是想害你，不要信她
皇叔，为什么不让他自己决定呢？
我需要你，祖寇
为了今天，我谋划好了每一步
今天将被载入烈火国的史册
只有我们合作才能胜利
今天结束后，你将夺回你的荣耀
还会赢回父皇对你的爱，你将会得到你想要的一切
祖寇，我求你了，扪心自问
问问自己想要的到底是什么
你自己选择吧
我们得找到索卡和拓芙
附近有戴笠的人吗？
没有
四周无人
咱们走
我不能丢下波斯科不管
我原以为你已经改变了
我的确改变了
来嘛，很简单的
你只是用前掌走路
而不用后腿，像这样
功夫不错啊
这熊你们尽管带走吧
他们人数太多了
只有忘却她，你才能掌握神通形态
卡塔拉，对不起
你们赶紧逃出去
我在这儿尽量拖住他们
祖寇，我们成功了
烈火国为了征服永固城已经花费了年
我背叛了皇叔
不，是他背叛了你
祖寇，等你班师回朝
父皇会视你为英雄
不过我没抓住神通，父皇又怎会恢复我的荣耀
祖寇，其实并不需要父皇
今天你已经找回了自己的荣耀
土强国...亡了
