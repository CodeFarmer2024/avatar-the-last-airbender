      [Introduction sequence]

      [“Previously on Avatar” includes clips from The Awakening, The Beach, The
      Library, and The Earth King]

      Act I

      (After the preview, the camera pans upward over a field of sleeping
      Koala-Sheep. Appa, Aang, Sokka, Katara, Toph and Momo come into the scene
      through a large hedge. Cut to closer shot of Sokka and his friends.)

      Sokka: (looking at a map) This is it, the official rendezvous point for
      the invasion force.

      (Camera pans over mountains and fields of Koala-Sheep)

      Toph: How did you pick this place‌
      Sokka: Before we split up, my dad and I found this island on a map.
      It&#x27;s uninhabited, and the harbor (cut to aerial shot of the cliff face)
      surrounded by cliffs seemed like the perfect secluded place.
      Katara: (cut to close-up ground level shot of the gang preparing for bed)
      Nice choice Sokka. And we&#x27;re here four days ahead of schedule.
      Aang: (shocked) Wait, (shoots out of bed and high into the air) four days!
      (close up of Aang’s horrified face) The invasion&#x27;s in four days!‌
      Sokka: (close shot of the inside of Sokka’s mouth, which pan’s out to
      reveal him yawning) Whatever. (nonchalant) That&#x27;s like…four days from now.
      (lays back onto his mat) Let&#x27;s just calm down, and ... (snore)

      (Cut to Sokka sleeping in the fore ground. Katara and Aang are in the
      background)

      Katara: Sokka&#x27;s got the right idea Aang. We&#x27;re here, we&#x27;re ready… (lays
      down on her mat) the best thing we can do now is get plenty of rest.

      (close-up shot of Aang.)

      Aang: Uh.. (looks around frantically but everyone seems to be asleep) I
      guess. (Aang curls up on the grass. The camera zooms in on his face and
      the scene fades to black)

      (The scene fade back in with a close shot of a large ornate Fire Nation
      symbol, it pans backward quickly, revealing that it is a large, ornate and
      intimidating door. The door busts open, revealing a boy with large hair, a
      headband and a yellow/orange jump suit with his back to us. He enters the
      room with a series of dramatic gestures. It is revealed that it is
      actually Aang who is in this strange garb. Aang takes an intense jump on
      to a rock tower. Cut to wider shot of Aang standing on the rock tower
      surrounded by floating broken pillars.)

      Aang: (continually making a series of comically fast and dramatic
      ninja-like moves during this speech) Your days of tyranny are over Fire
      Lord. I&#x27;m bringing you down!

      (Cut to close shot of an elaborately dressed Fire Lord with Kabuki-like
      facial features. He is about to take a bite of a bundle of grapes, but
      stops and looks down at who ever is disturbing him. The camera pans out
      quickly to reveal he is actually a giant when compared to Aang and
      surrounded by a pit of fire.)

      Fire Lord Ozai: Really, (bends his giant face close to Aang’s) how do you
      plan on doing that (cut to Aang’s horrified face) when you&#x27;re not even
      wearing pants!

      (Aang looks down to discover this is true and screams. He quickly covers
      himself with a fuzzy white water tribe shield pulled out of thin air. The
      camera pans out to a larger shot of Aang shaking with embarrassment.
      Suddenly, giant eyes begin to appear all around him. The eye’s close and
      disappear back into the walls. Cut to shot of the giant Fire Lord laughing
      as Aang slowly backs out the door. The Fire Lord raises his arms to the
      ceiling, while surrounded by flames, laughing heartily.)

      Aang: (cut to shot of Aang waking up startled) Uah! (Aang feels all around
      to make sure he is wearing pants, and then sighs with relief. Momo
      approaches him) It was just a dream Momo, I still have my pants. (cut to
      wide ground shot of Aang getting up) Well, I better keep training.

      (Close shot of Aang with an extremely intense look on his face. The camera
      pans out to reveal he is kicking a bush. Wide shot of Momo looking on at
      Aang kicking the bush. Momo’s ears go down in a gesture of displeasure and
      he curls up for sleep.)

      (Cut to wide shot of an elaborate Fire Nation palace. Cut to shot of
      servants carrying a robe, which is placed around and buttoned onto Prince
      Zuko.)

      1st Servant: (a servant steps forward with a bowl) Fresh fruit, Prince
      Zuko‌ (Zuko gestures him away)
      2nd Servant: (eagerly) May I wash your feet, sir‌ (Zuko again gestures a
      decline)
      1st Servant: Head massage‌ (Zuko looks away)
      2nd Servant: (close shot of some neatly bundled and steaming towels) Hot
      towel‌

      (Zuko looks at this option a little longer, sighs and then picks up a
      towel, rubs his face and places it back on the plate of towels. The
      servant bows and smiles. Aerial shot of large elaborate gate opening as
      prince Zuko walks through. He is greeting by a large crowd of admirers and
      giggling females. Cut to shot of Zuko looking pleased. Cut to shot of a
      large, awkward looking girl. She gets overly excited by Zuko’s entrance
      and must be restrained by the guards. Cut back to shot of Zuko, who is
      approached from behind by some servants carrying a beautiful and elaborate
      Palanquin.)

      Palanquin Servant: Prince Zuko, is something wrong‌ You didn&#x27;t take the
      palanquin.
      Zuko: I&#x27;m just going to Mai&#x27;s house, it&#x27;s not far.
      Palanquin Servant: It&#x27;s not a Prince&#x27;s place to walk anywhere, sir.

      (Cut to close shot of a pensive Zuko, looking across the courtyard and
      then back at the Palanquin. He smirks and approaches the Palanquin. Cut to
      a wide shot of the Palanquin being carried a comically short distance to
      Mai’s large residence. Cut to shot of Zuko sitting inside. He pulls back
      the curtain and smiles at Mai, who waves from a large ornate doorway.)

      (Cut to shot of the top of a tree shaking. The camera pans down to reveal
      a shirtless Aang punching the tree. Cut to close shot of Aang looking
      extremely intense and concentrated on this task. Cut to a shot of the
      others slowly waking up from the sound of the punching. Katara, looking
      drowsy turns, toward Sokka. Sokka shrugs and Katara gets up. She
      approaches a very fierce looking Aang from behind.)

      Katara: Hey, how long have you been up‌
      Aang: A couple hours. (Aang circles the tree, doing some fancy footwork
      and varying the type of punches) I got a lot more skills to refine if I&#x27;m
      going to fight Ozai.
      Katara: (close shot of Aang, very out of breath) You know there is such a
      thing as over-training.

      (Aang gives a final extremely hard punch, which reverberates through his
      body in a comedic fashion. He falls backward, stuck in his punching
      position. After a pause, the all the leaves fall from the tree at once.
      Cut to shot of Katara looking on in disbelieve. Sokka’s and Toph’s heads
      pop out from behind her. Cut to close sot of Aang, eyes wide, with gray
      bags under them. He holds up his hands in a defensive pose. Leaves fly
      from his body.)

      Aang: You don&#x27;t get it, do you‌ (Aang circles Katara, who looks half
      frightened half amused, as Aang does a variety of air punches and
      defensive maneuvers) My form is bad. I&#x27;m sloppy. And I still don&#x27;t know
      any fire bending, not even the basics.

      (Aang’s eye twitches. Cut to shot of Katara, moving Aang’s hand away from
      her face with a worried smile. Cut to shot of Sokka relaxing on the grass
      looking at his map.)

      Sokka: That&#x27;s okay Aang. The eclipse will block all firebending anyway,
      you don&#x27;t need to know any. (he looks toward Aang) Plus it&#x27;s a stupid
      element.
      Aang: Okay, (raises his arms and then begins a series of comic and sloppy
      attempts at chops, punches and kicks) well, I still have to work on
      everything else.
      I&#x27;d better spend the whole day training.

      (Aang bows quickly toward everyone and then creates an air ball and rides
      away on it. Cut to Sokka looking worried and then hiding his face behind
      the map. Toph sits bored in the background, totally unaffected by
      everything that has gone on that morning.)

      (Cut to night. Aang slinks back to camp in a zombie like fashion. He turns
      to the camera, gives a long yawn and falls back onto the ground.)

      Aang: (wide shot of the group on the cliffside) Good night Katara. Good
      night Sokka. Good night Toph. Good night Appa. Good night Momo. Good night
      Appa and Momo.

      (A large speech bubble emerges with a very angry chibi Toph inside.)

      Toph: (yelling) Go to sleep already!

      (Cut to Aang cringing, and then laying back relaxed. His eyes slowly close
      and the camera pans upward into darkness.)

      (Cut to shot of Aang busting through the same large Fire Nation door from
      his previous dream. He is again dressed in odd clothing. This time he has
      chains, a high collared yellow vest, a headband, boots and spiky hair. He
      snaps, and dramatic fog enters through the doors. He runs through the room
      and jumps to the rock tower opposite the fire lord.)

      Aang: (He points coolly) Your days of tyranny are over Fire Lord. I&#x27;m
      bringing you down…and this time I brought pants. (The camera pans down to
      reveal the chains are meant to lock on the pants)

      Fire Lord Ozai: (Cut to very close shot of the Fire Lord) So it seems. (He
      stands up and a giant abacus falls from the ceiling) But are you prepared
      for your mathematics test‌
      Aang: (close shot of Aang in a panic) Math test‌! Oh no! (he turns toward
      the camera) I forgot all about the math test! (Aang falls through the air
      yelling, and is crushed between the giant abacus beads. He wakes up
      startled, sweat dripping from his brow.) I&#x27;ve got to be ready!

      (Aang gets up and walks away. Cut to shot of Aang circling some sleeping
      Koala-Sheep, practicing various defensive moves. Katara approaches.)

      Katara: Aang, it&#x27;s the middle of the night. You need to go back to sleep.
      Aang: (ground level shot of Aang looking wild and still concentrated on
      the Koala-Sheep) But I forgot my pants and my math test.
      Katara: (Katara sighs, and then breathes in deeply, she moves forward and
      grabs Aangs shoulders. Aangs very bloodshot eyes turn toward her) Aang,
      sleep. Please…for me.

      (Shot of Aang looking confused and rubbing his eyes. Katara leads him back
      toward their camp. A Koala-Sheep bleats after them.

      Cut to very wide aerial shot of the Fire Nation Palace and it’s
      surroundings area. Cut to shot of Zuko and Mai lying down together on an
      ornate couch.)

      Zuko: Tell me, if you can have anything you wanted right now, what would
      it be‌
      Mai: Hmm. A big fancy fruit tart, with rose petals on top.
      Zuko: (cut to close up shot of Zuko and Mai) You know, being a prince and
      all, I might just be able to make that happen.
      Mai: (giggles) That would be impressive.

      (Shot of two fire nation servants in a curtained doorway. The back of the
      couch lies in the center of the scene. Zuko and Mai sit up come into
      view.)

      Zuko: Do you think (the guards turn towards the couple and bow) you can
      find a fresh fruit tart for the lady, with rose petals on top.
      Royal Servant: (shot of the two guards bowing) Excellent choice, sir.
      Mai: (close shot of Zuko and Mai. The camera begins to pan out slowly) I
      guess there are some perks that come with being royalty. (they lie back
      down) Though, there is annoying stuff too, like that all-day war meeting
      coming up.
      Zuko: (Zuko sits up completely, surprised, and turns toward Mai, who is
      also surprised) War meeting‌ What are you talking about‌
      Mai: Azula mentioned something, (Zuko turns away and looks down. Cut to
      close shot of Mai speaking to a disgruntled Zuko) I assumed you were going
      too.
      Zuko: (closes his eyes and turns away) I guess I wasn&#x27;t invited.

      (Aerial shot of the rendezvous point where Aang and the others are
      staying. Cut to a close up shot of Aang asleep on the grass.)

      Fire Lord Ozai: Wake up Aang. (Aang’s eyes begin to open. Cut to an out of
      focus swaying shot of the Fire Lord standing over Aang) Wake up
      sleepy-head. Rise and shine. You over-slept. (The Fire Lord bends in
      close, and then even closer) You missed the invasion.

      (He laughs and then the shot pans out to reveal he is riding on a flying
      hippo pig. The creature breaths fire and flies skywards as the Fire Lord
      laughs menacingly. Cut to shot of Aang waking up in a panic. He turns to
      Sokka who is still sound asleep and shakes him vigorously.)

      Aang: Sokka get up! I need to know what day it is! (Aang pulls on Sokka’s
      eyelids and lips in a comedic fashion.)
      Sokka: What! (jumps up) Who’s talking! (Sokka thrust forward with his
      sword, but hits a rock head-on before he can complete his swing. He falls
      back on to his sleeping mat, his body stiff, frozen in the swinging
      position)
      Toph: (cut to Toph sitting up, Katara visible in the background) Relax,
      it&#x27;s still two days before the invasion.
      Aang: (cut to Aang hopping around the sleepy Sokka, tugging on various
      limbs) Sokka, you&#x27;ve got to get up and drill your rock climbing exercises.

      Sokka: What‌
      Aang: (cut to close shot of Aang, looking unfocused and tired. He makes
      overly large comedic gestures during his speech and often looks confused)
      In one of my dreams, you were running from fire nation soldiers, trying to
      climb this cliff, but you (cut to close shot of Sokka looking disgruntled)
      were too slow and they got you. (Sokka springs up to stand before Aang)
      Sokka: But that was just a dream, (points at Aang) I&#x27;m a great climber.

      (Cut to shot of Aang and Sokka standing at the bottom of a cliff.)

      Aang: (points upward) Then climb that cliff. Climb it fast!

      (The camera pans upward to reveal the cliff is quite large and steep. The
      camera pans back down to show Sokka looking up at the cliff summit,
      looking back at Aang and then pointing to himself. Aang nods and Sokka
      slinks off toward the cliff. Cut to close shot of Sokka beginning to
      climb.)

      Sokka: (annoyed) Stupid Avatar. Stupid cliff. Stupid dream! I can climb
      fast!

      (Aang looks pleased and relieved at Sokka’s climbing. Suddenly he turns
      around to Katara and Toph. Toph has just put her lips to a satchel of
      water.)

      Aang: (Yells, causing Sokka to startle and slip down the cliff face) Don&#x27;t
      drink that!

      (Cut to shot of Toph and Katara sitting. Toph throws away the satchel and
      spits the water all over Katara, who is disgusted.)

      Toph: (perturbed) Why, is it poisoned‌ (an annoyed Katara water bends the
      water off herself)

      (Cut to Aang approaching the girls. His eyes are crossed.)

      Aang: In my dream, we were right in the middle of the invasion, and you
      had to stop to use the bathroom. We died because of your tiny bladder.
      (Aang mimics holding his bladder) And you (addressing Katara) need to
      start wearing your hair up. (Aang gestures his hair and then starts
      pulling and stretching his forehead) In my dream, your hair got caught in
      a train, and ...
      Katara: (cut to Katara holding Aang’s cheek) Aang, I know you&#x27;re just
      trying to help. But you really need to get a grip. You&#x27;re unraveling.

      (The camera pans in on Aang who looks around unsettled. He looks extremely
      tired and has dark circles under his eyes. Aang lets out a sigh.)

      Aang: You&#x27;re right. I&#x27;m losing my mind.

      (The camera pans over to Sokka, who is nearly to the top of the cliff. He
      suddenly slides down.)

      Sokka: Ahhh!

      Act II

      (The scene opens with the sun beating down. Cut to a extreme close up of
      Aang’s twitching eye.)

      Aang: It&#x27;s like every time I think about how stressed I am, (Cut to shot
      of Aang twittering his fingers in a nervous fashion) I just end up more
      stressed. (Cut to wide shot of Aang pacing back and forth. His friends sit
      in the background. They are absorbed in their own tasks and seem to be
      ignoring Aang’s ravings) I&#x27;m like a big, growing snowball of nerves.
      Sokka: (turning toward Aang) Of course you are. That&#x27;s &#x27;cause you&#x27;ve got
      to fight the Fire Lord, (extreme close shot of Aang’s horrified face) the
      baddest man on the planet. And you better win, or we&#x27;re all done for. (The
      camera pans left to reveal an angry Katara standing up and turning to
      Sokka)
      Katara: Sokka, you&#x27;re not helping!
      Sokka: (standing up) What‌ It&#x27;s true. That&#x27;s the deal, he knows it.
      (Katara pushes Sokka to a sitting position angrily)

      (Cut to close shot of Katara looking on at Aang worried. Cut to shot of
      Aang shaking and chattering with fear. Katara approaches him.)

      Katara: You know what‌ I&#x27;ve got just the thing. (places her arms on Aang’s
      shoulders, smiling) Get ready to be “de-stress-i-fied”. (Cut to wide shot
      of the outside of a steaming crater. Cut to shot of Aang and Katara
      standing beside the steaming water inside the crater) These yoga stretches
      can really work wonders if you do them in extreme heat. Reach up. (Aang
      and Katara reach upward) Reach for the sun. (Aang and Katara sway from
      side to side) Feel your chi paths clearing. (They bend over and touch
      their heads to the ground) Now close your eyes. How are you feeling‌
      Aang: (cut to close up shot of Aang upside down. The camera spins and pans
      inward, in a dizzying motion) I feel…really warm.
      Katara: Good, good. Go on.
      Aang: Like there&#x27;s the warm feeling all around me. This heat…like I&#x27;m in
      the Fire Lord&#x27;s palace, and he&#x27;s shooting a bunch of fire balls at me. And
      the whole world is being engulfed in flames. (flames shoot across the
      scene and spiral inward. There is a flash. Cut to Aang rolling out of the
      yoga position and on to his back. Katara looks up and the tired and out of
      breath Aang)
      Katara: Maybe your stress is the kind you need to talk out.

      (Cut to shot of clear blue skies and the green fields of the cliff face.
      Cut to closer shot of Aang laying his head on a Koala-Sheep. Sokka sits
      beside him dawning the ‘Wang Fire’ beard. His elbows are propped up on a
      Koala-Sheep. He looks pensive.)

      Sokka: (speaking in a mocking, old man sounding, psychiatric tone) Why
      don&#x27;t you get right down to business and tell me what&#x27;s been bothering
      you.
      Aang: (close aerial shot of Aang looking disgruntled) You know what&#x27;s
      bothering me. I have to fight the Fire Lord in a few days.
      (Cut to close shot of Sokka.)
      Sokka: Mhm. (nods and gestures toward Aang) Tell me more about this, &#x27;Fire
      Lord.&#x27; Why are you so afraid of him‌
      Aang: (The camera pans over a wider aerial shot of Aang, Sokka and the
      Koala-Sheep) You said it yourself. He&#x27;s the baddest man on the planet. I&#x27;m
      supposed to defeat him and save the world.
      Sokka: Hmm. (close shot of Sokka with his eyes closed and nodding deeply)
      Life does feel that way some times, doesn&#x27;t it‌ (cut back to shot of Aang,
      now getting frustrated) Like we&#x27;re all trying to save the world from evil.

      Aang: Okay, but what can I do to feel better‌
      Sokka: Want to try screaming into this pillow‌

      (Close shot of Aang being presented with a fluffy Koala-Sheep. Aang
      screams into it and the Koala-Sheep bleats comically. Sokka scratches his
      head and then gives Aang the thumbs up sign and nods. Aang shakes his head
      indicating the negative.

      Cut to an up close shot of some long black hair in a pool of water. An
      ornate gold comb brushes though the hair. The camera pans right to reveal
      that it is Azula’s hair that’s being combed. Cut to wide shot of the
      ornate palace room. Zuko approaches Azula.)

      Azula: Hello Zu-zu. I&#x27;ve you&#x27;ve come for a royal hair combing, I&#x27;m afraid
      you&#x27;ll have to wait.

      (Cut to close shot of Zuko standing over Azula.)

      Zuko: So I guess there&#x27;s a big war meeting coming up, huh. And apparently
      I&#x27;m not welcome there.
      Azula: What do you mean‌ Of course you&#x27;re welcome there.
      Zuko: (close shot of Zuko, perturbed) Oh yeah‌ I guess that&#x27;s why no one
      bothered to tell me about it.

      (Cut to close shot of Azula and the two maids brushing her hair. Azula
      eyes Zuko.)

      Azula: Oh Zuko, don&#x27;t be so dramatic. I&#x27;m certain Dad wants you there.
      You probably weren&#x27;t invited, because it&#x27;s so obvious that you&#x27;re supposed
      to be there.
      Zuko: (close up on Zuko, questioning) Well, were you invited‌
      Azula: (close shot of Azula, looking smug) Of course. I&#x27;m the Princess.
      Zuko: (annoyed) And I&#x27;m the Prince!
      Azula: Exactly, so stop acting (gestures) like a paranoid child. (close up
      shot of Zuko looking annoyed) Just go to the meeting.
      Zuko: Forget it, I&#x27;m not going.

      (Zuko walks out of the room. Cut to shot of Aang laying on a bed of pillar
      shaped rocks with his eyes closed. Toph stands next to him.)

      Toph: Alright, what you need is a good old fashioned back poundin&#x27; to
      relieve your stress.
      Aang: Pound away. (Toph begins to stomp her feet causing the pillars to
      pummel Aang) Ahh! Ow! Uh! Toph! (close shot of Aang in serious pain) I ...
      think ... this ... is ... bruising ... me! (Toph stops and Aang falls off
      the bed of rock pillars)
      Toph: Sorry, I forgot you have baby skin. (close shot of Toph looking
      pensive) Well, there&#x27;s one other thing we can try… (Toph stops and a
      porcupine flies into her hand from a nearby bush. It uncurls and bears its
      needles. Toph gives a large grin) acupuncture!
      Aang: (Aang looks at the porcupine, screams and runs away) Ahhhh!

      (Cut to shot of Zuko looking out an open window. Mai approaches him from
      behind.)

      Mai: Zuko, it&#x27;s just a dumb meeting. Who cares‌
      Zuko: I don&#x27;t.

      (Close up shot of Mai talking to Zuko, while Zuko still looks out into the
      distance.)

      Mai: Well good. You shouldn&#x27;t. Why would you even want to go‌ (Cut to shot
      of Zuko and Mai standing in the window, the Fire Nation Palace before
      them. Mai puts her arm around Zuko) Just think about how things went to
      the last war meeting you went to.
      Zuko: (sighs) I know.
      Mai: (cut to shot of Mai, circling Zuko, attempting to distract him) You
      know what will make you feel better‌ Ordering some servants around! I
      might be hungry for a whole tray of fruit tarts! And maybe a little
      palanquin ride around town…Double time!

      (Zuko looks away from Mai. Mai backs away from him, looking worried.

      Cut to shot wide shot of Appa and the others at their camp. Cut to close
      shot of Aang sitting in a curled up position, looking sickly.)

      Aang: Thanks for everything guys.
      Katara: (Cut to shot of Katara and the others looking toward Aang with
      smiles) So do you feel less stressed‌ Ready for a good night sleep‌
      Aang: (close shot of Aang looking confused) Uhh...I kinda think I sorta
      might ... slightly feel a little better ... maybe.
      Sokka: (cut to shot of Sokka) Then our work here is done.

      (Sokka yawns, stretches and falls back onto his sleeping mat. The others
      do the same. Aang is the only one left awake and alone. Aang lays back and
      closes his eyes and the scene fades to black.)

      (Cut to a red hued scene of Aang flying Appa through a huge storm. Some
      giant arms swing at him but he dodges them. It is revealed to be a giant
      Momo that is attacking them. Momo grabs Appa and Aang. Cut to shot of Aang
      breaking through cement in front of the Fire Nation Castle. Aang is
      transported to the front steps, through the door and down some hallways in
      a choppy dream-like horror sequence. Cut to close up shot of Aang’s eye. A
      creepy image of Toph flashes in his pupil. Cut to shot of the creepy Toph,
      she floats close to him and her hair blows out of her face to reveal that
      she has no eyes! Cut to shot of Toph falling through the floor and Aang
      looking scared.

      Cut to shot of Sokka running though a tunnel. Some gooey tentacles reach
      for him, he struggles but they swallow him up. Cut to a close up shot of a
      scared Katara. Fire flashes in her eyes. Fire surrounds her. Aang attempts
      to save her but is bound at his feet by ice. The ice crawls up his whole
      body leaving him frozen. Cut to shot of Aang frozen on an ice cliff. A
      large fire in the shape of the fire lord looms over him, cackling madly.
      It bites at Aang causing him to melt and he falls into a deep abyss and
      then into a pool of water.

      The scene flips upside down and Aang swims upward only to discover he is
      trapped under ice. He pounds at the ice as Prince Zuko stands over him
      motionless. Sozin’s comet flies by Zuko’s head in the background. Cut to
      close shot of the comet. Cut to close shot of Aang holding his breath
      under the ice. Cut to close shot of the comet speeding downward. Cut to
      close shot of Momo. Momo holds his finger to his lips and whispers ‘Shhh’.
      Cut to shot of Aang floating and overlooking a beautiful valley. Suddenly,
      the comet hits the valley, turning everything to black and gray. The scene
      fades to white and then comes back and the Valley is now nothing but fire
      and lava. )

      (Cut to scene of Aang waking up and screaming. He continues to scream. Cut
      to shot of everyone waking up. Cut to shot of Appa jumping with fright,
      causing Momo to fall off his back. Katara, Toph and Sokka rush over.)

      Katara: (worried) What happened Aang‌
      Aang: (Aang turns away from his friends and slumps over, bowing his head
      to the ground) It&#x27;s the nightmares. They just get worse and worse.
      Sokka: (cut to close shot of Sokka) Looks like it&#x27;s time for… (he spins
      around and now dons the ‘Wang Fire’ beard) another therapy session.
      Aang: (Aang looks up at him, disgusted and then turns around and speaks
      angrily) No, that won&#x27;t help. Nothing helps. (close shot of Aang looking
      determined) There&#x27;s only one thing I can do. I&#x27;m going to stay awake
      straight through to the invasion.

      (Aang twitches, and the camera pans up to see Katara’s shocked face and
      Sokka’s beard fall off. Toph seems to find this amusing.)

      Act III

      (The scene opens with Katara stretching on a scenic cliff above the ocean.
      Aang stumbles into the scene in a zombie like trance and nearly stumbles.)

      Aang: Invasion. All aboard for the invasion.
      Katara: You don&#x27;t look so good. (approaches Aang) You sure you can&#x27;t just
      lie down for a little nap.
      Aang: (cut to close up shot of Aang turning towards Katara) I told you, I
      can&#x27;t go back to sleep.

      (Cut to wide shot of the two of them, a scenic sunset on the ocean is in
      the background.)

      Katara: Aang, staying up can&#x27;t be good for you.
      Aang: Actually staying up all night has given me some time to think. (Aang
      walks toward the ocean, Katara follows him) And I&#x27;ve realized some big
      things Katara.
      Katara: (close up shot of Katara) What big things‌
      Aang: (looking out into the sunset) I see everything so clearly now…what
      really matters. Why I&#x27;m really doing this. I&#x27;m doing it to save the world,
      (turns toward Katara) but more than that. I&#x27;m doing it for the people I
      love. (close up shot of Aang stepping right up to Katara) I&#x27;m doing it for
      you Katara.
      Katara: Aang, what are you saying‌
      Aang: I&#x27;m saying…I love you.

      (Aang kisses Katara. Katara looks shocked, then smiles and kisses Aang
      back, throwing her arms around him. Cut to a wide shot of the two of them
      kissing in the sunset. Cut to close up shot of the kiss. They pull apart.)

      Katara: What are we doing‌
      Aang: What our hearts (lifts arms into the air in a grand gesture) have
      been telling us to do for a long, long time. Baby, (swings Katara on to
      her back and goes in for another kiss) you&#x27;re my forever girl.

      (Close up shot of Aang with comically huge, puffy and drool strewn lips
      making a kiss face.)

      Katara: Aang‌
      Aang: Huh‌

      (The scene pans out to reveal Aang is holding and kissing air. Katara is
      standing behind him looking at him strangely.)

      Katara: I was just saying you should take a nap.
      Aang: Oh, (straightens up and faces Katara) I guess I kinda drifted off
      into a day-dream.
      Katara: What was your dream about‌
      Aang: (looks embarrassed) Uhh, living under water‌
      Katara: (looks skeptical, then smiles) Sounds neat.
      Aang: (close up shot of Aang breathing a sigh of relief) Heh. Phew.

      (Cut to an outside wide shot of Mai’s House. Cut to close up shot of
      Prince Zuko. The camera pans out to reveal he is laying on the couch. Mai
      sits next to him pouring tea. A servant enters.)

      Messenger: Prince Zuko, (bows to the ground) everyone&#x27;s waiting for you.
      Zuko: (Zuko and Mai approach him) What‌

      Messenger: The high admirals, high generals, the war ministers, and the
      princess have all arrived. (close up shot of the messenger raising his
      head to Zuko) You&#x27;re the only person missing.
      Zuko: (close up shot of Zuko and Mai. Mai is smiling) So, my dad wants me
      at the meeting‌
      Royal Messenger: The Fire Lord said he would not start until you arrived,
      sir. (bows his head again)

      (Zuko smiles and looks towards Mai, still smiling. Cut to shot of Aang
      hiding in the bushes. He jumps out, does a summersault and hides against a
      rock. He pops out from behind the rock.)

      Aang: Put &#x27;em up, Fire Lord.

      (Cut to shot of Sokka’s noodle Ozai picture and a red target fastened to a
      tree. Aang shoots a kick of Air at it and misses, knocking Sokka to the
      ground.)

      Sokka: Hey, I&#x27;m trying to build Appa some armor here so he doesn&#x27;t have to
      go into the invasion naked. He&#x27;s your bison ...
      Aang: (close up shot of Aang, his arm reached out in front of him at some
      imaginary enemy) Ozai&#x27;s defense is impeccable. I&#x27;ll have to try a
      different approach. (Aang jumps up into the air with a yell and beings to
      shoot balls of air down at the noodle Ozai. All 4 shots miss.) You think
      you&#x27;re untouchable, don&#x27;t you Mr. Fire Lord.

      (Aang approaches the noodle drawing but a strange voice speaks from behind
      him)

      Voice: Boy, you are really starting to lose it kid.

      (Aang turns around to see Momo sitting there on a rock.)

      Aang: Momo, did you hear something.

      (Aang turns back around, but the voice comes again.)

      Momo: No, but I said something.
      Aang: Uhh. (Aang bends in toward Momo looking very confused. Cut to close
      shot of Momo)
      Momo: You my friend are just a few plumbs short of a fruit pie.

      (Cut to close up shot of Aang looking at Momo in disbelief. He backs away
      and shakes his head vigorously. He covers his eyes and then peeks through
      them. Momo is speaking in his normal animal language again.)

      Aang: That&#x27;s more like it. (pets Momo) I&#x27;m so tired, that for a second
      there I imagined you were talking to me. (Momo cocks his head to one side
      as if he is confused) Oh, Momo…let me explain.

      (Cut to shot of Aang attempting to speak Momo’s animal language. Toph,
      Katara and Sokka stand in the background looking very confused and
      worried. Momo and Aang seem to be carrying on their own private
      conversation. Aang even laughs a few times.)

      Katara: Aang‌ (Aang and Momo look up in surprise. Cut to shot of Katara.)
      We&#x27;re all starting to get a little worried about you.
      Sokka: (camera pans right to Sokka) You&#x27;ve been awake too long.
      Toph: (camera pans right to Toph) And you&#x27;re acting downright weird.
      Appa: (camera pans right to Appa, who is standing on his hind legs like a
      human and pointing his finger as if to give a lecture) You&#x27;ve got to take
      care of yourself. You can&#x27;t go on like this.
      Aang: Uhh. (bows his head, frustrated, and then lifts his finger to make a
      point. Cut to wide scene of Aang talking to everyone. Appa is still
      standing there like a human) I appreciate what you guys are saying. But
      the stress and the nightmares, they were too much. Staying awake is the
      best way for me to deal with it.

      Momo: (Momo stands up and points his finger at Appa) Yeah, leave the kid
      alone.
      Appa: (Appa points back down at Momo, looking Angry) Hey, who asked you‌

      (Wide shot of Aang and Momo snarling at one another)

      Aang: Guys…come on.
      Appa: (Close up shot of Appa looking angry) No! I&#x27;m sick of this guy
      always mouthing off, (Cut to shot of Momo who is very mad) and telling me
      what to do.
      Aang: Oh, you don&#x27;t like it‌ Well let&#x27;s go right now.

      (Cut to close up shot of Aang running up to Sokka and grabbing on to his
      shirt collar.)

      Aang: Sokka, what should we do‌
      Sokka: About what‌
      Aang: About that! (turns toward Appa and Momo)

      (Cut to shot of Momo dressed in Samurai garb. Momo scratches his cheek.

      Koala Sheep: Appa! Appa! Appa!

      (Cut to another crowd of cheering Koala-Sheep on the opposite side.)

      Koala Sheep: Momo! Momo! Momo!

      (Cut to shot of Momo peering behind him at Appa, both are ready for the
      next attack, swords drawn. Appa draws his many swords and suddenly turns
      into a giant tornado! He spins towards Momo. Momo is able to defend his
      attacks. Cut to shot of Aang walking up to the scene, looking confused and
      worried.)

      Aang: Come on guys, (cut to shot of Momo and Appa fighting with a ring of
      Koala-Sheep cheering around them. Aang stands outside the ring trying to
      get everyone’s attention) we&#x27;re all on the same side!

      (A multi-armed Guru Pathik floats into the scene on a cloud. He is playing
      a sitar-like instrument and singing merrily, while Appa and Momo continue
      their sword fight in the background. Aang stands before it all in
      disbelief.)

      Guru Pathik: Chakras, chakras, everybody loves chakras! (Cut to close shot
      of the Guru. A golden light surrounds his head. He bends in towards the

      (Cut to shot of Appa and Momo in some very intense fighting. Cut to close
      up shot of the Koala-Sheep cheering them on.)

      Koala Sheep: Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay!

      (Cut to close up shot of Aang’s confused eyes. Cut to a wider shot of the
      forest. Suddenly some snake-like lines of rocks move on their own towards
      the field. Aang looks down at the rock snakes confused. One of them
      circles around him and then drifts away.)

      Aang: Huh‌ Huh!

      (Cut to shot of the crowd of Koala-Sheep cheering.)

      Koala Sheep: Yay! Yay! Yay!

      (Cut to shot of the tree Aang used earlier for target practice. It still
      has Sokka’s noodle Ozai on the face. It also wears a red target apron. It
      has taken on human like limbs and shape and begins to dance around and
      throw some punches. Cut to wide shot of the entire scene. Appa and Momo
      still fight in the background. The rock snakes have risen up into
      slithering pillars. Aang is surrounded by a ring of rocks and a ring of
      cheering Koala-Sheep. Cut to close shot of Aang looking panicked.)

      Aang: (yelling) I just need a jump in a cold waterfall.

      (Aang screams and runs out of the scene into the forest.

      and she follows him.)

      Mai: So, how did it go‌
      Zuko: When I got to the meeting, everyone welcomed me. (cut to close up
      shot of Zuko) My father had saved me a seat. He wanted me next to him.
      (cut to wider shot of Zuko and Mai walking) I was literally at his right
      hand.
      Mai: Zuko, that&#x27;s wonderful. (grabs on to him) You must be happy‌

      (Zuko and Mai pause at the end of the hallway. The camera pans upward to a
      large ornate picture of Ozai, who is made to look incredibly powerful. Cut
      to shot of Zuko looking up at this picture and Mai looking concerned at
      him.)

      Zuko: During the meeting, I was the perfect prince. (close up shot of
      Ozai’s face in the picture) The son my father wanted. But I wasn&#x27;t me.
      (close up shot of Zuko, he bows his head. Cut wide shot of them standing
      in the wide empty palace hallway.)

      (Cut to shot of the rendezvous point at nighttime. Cut to shot of Aang
      walking, suddenly he is engulfed in a cloud of mist. In the middle of the
      mist is a large fluffy white pad. Aang approaches it. He comically pops
      around all sides of the pad, feeling and inspecting it’s fluffiness. Cut
      to close shot of Aang, his cheek pressed to the fluffy pad. He looks at it
      very skeptically.)

      Aang: Oh look, another hallucination. An imaginary bed, made out of
      clouds.

      (The camera pans sideways to reveal Toph, Katara and Sokka standing there,
      observing Aang.)

      Toph: Hey! It&#x27;s real! We spent hours working on it.
      Sokka: We made it for you. (the camera pans further right to reveal a herd
      of recently shaved and shivering Koala-Sheep.) A good night sleep will
      probably take the crazy away…we hope.

      (Cut to shot of Aang crouched defensively on the fluffy white bed of
      Koala-Sheep wool. He hops off and approaches his friends.)

      Aang: Look, you guys keep telling me I need to sleep, but I can&#x27;t, the
      invasion&#x27;s tomorrow.
      Katara: (imploringly) Aang…
      Aang: (determined) No Katara, there&#x27;s still so much I haven&#x27;t learned. I
      don&#x27;t need sleep. What I need is practice. Quick, hit me. (raises his
      fists in a feeble attempt)
      Katara: I&#x27;m not going to hit you.
      Toph: (eager) You want me to do it‌
      Katara: Listen to me, (grabs Aang’s shoulder) you&#x27;ve been training for
      this since the day we&#x27;ve met. I&#x27;ve seen your progress. You&#x27;re smart,
      brave, and strong enough.
      Aang: (close shot of Aang turning to Katara) You really think so‌
      Sokka: (cut to Toph and Sokka. Sokka’s arms open) We all do. You can do
      this. You&#x27;re ready.
      Toph: You&#x27;re the man, (points at Aang) Twinkle-toes.
      Aang: Thanks guys. (close shot of Aang smiling. He yawns and Katara helps
      him onto the fluffy Koala-Sheep wool bed.) You know what‌ I think I am
      ready.

      (The camera pans upward to black. Cut to shot of Aang breaking through the
      same dream door to the Fire Lord’s palace. He is in yet another set of
      unusual yellow/orange clothing. This time he has long hair and a samurai
      sword. He flies into the room sword first. A giant Fire Lord stands in the
      fire pit as before, although this Fire Lords features are much more
      similar to Ozai’s.)

      Aang: (standing on the ledge below the Fire Lord) Your days of tyranny are
      over, Fire Lord.
      Fire Lord Ozai: (cut to close shot of the Fire Lord) Really‌ You&#x27;re going
      to take me out‌ You&#x27;re not even wearing pants. (smiles menacingly)
      Aang: (smiles slyly) No Fire Lord Ozai, (raises his sword) you&#x27;re not
      wearing pants.
      Fire Lord Ozai: (Ozai looks down and screams in surprise) No! (he covers
      himself with a fluffy fire nation shield) My royal parts are showing!

      (Cut to shot of the floating Fire Nation dream castle. Cut to shot of Aang
      smiling in his bed of Koala-Sheep wool surrounded by mist. The scene fades
      to white.)

00:02:38,897 --&gt; 00:02:40,649
是吗？

45
00:02:40,649 --&gt; 00:02:42,693
那你打算怎么做呢？

46
00:02:42,693 --&gt; 00:02:46,530
连裤子都没穿，你又能做些什么呢？

47
00:02:47,406 --&gt; 00:02:49,783
哦，糟了

48
00:03:11,054 --&gt; 00:03:12,973
只是个梦而已，模模

00:03:13,098 --&gt; 00:03:14,975
我的裤子还在

50
00:03:16,685 --&gt; 00:03:20,522
那个，我还是继续修炼吧

51
00:03:35,203 --&gt; 00:03:37,956
祖寇殿下，新鲜的水果，请您享用

52
00:03:38,039 --&gt; 00:03:40,542
殿下，用我服侍您洗脚吗？

53
00:03:40,667 --&gt; 00:03:43,336
需要头部按摩吗？

54
00:03:43,420 --&gt; 00:03:46,006
要热毛巾吗？

55
00:04:05,859 --&gt; 00:04:08,069
祖寇殿下，发生什么事了？

56
00:04:08,153 --&gt; 00:04:09,362
为什么不乘轿子呢？

57
00:04:09,446 --&gt; 00:04:11,906
我只是想去梅的府上看看，并不很远

58
00:04:11,990 --&gt; 00:04:15,618
哪有让您王子殿下步行的道理啊？

59
00:04:51,612 --&gt; 00:04:54,323
嘿，你已经起来多久了？

60
00:04:54,448 --&gt; 00:04:56,284
有个把小时了吧

61
00:04:56,409 --&gt; 00:04:58,828
如果要与烈火王欧宰决斗的话
我还要精进以下我的武艺

62
00:04:58,870 --&gt; 00:05:02,498
难道你不知道过度训练的后果吗？

63
00:05:11,590 --&gt; 00:05:13,259
我看你还不明白

64
00:05:13,384 --&gt; 00:05:17,847
我的招式不精，不，我简直太滥了
况且我还没有学会御火术

65
00:05:17,930 --&gt; 00:05:21,267
连个皮毛都还不了解

66
00:05:21,392 --&gt; 00:05:24,478
没事的，安昂，日食会抑制御火术的

67
00:05:24,562 --&gt; 00:05:26,021
你干嘛还要费力学它

68
00:05:26,147 --&gt; 00:05:27,690
再说了，火本身就是个愚蠢的元素

69
00:05:27,773 --&gt; 00:05:30,860
那倒是，不过我还有其他的招式需要研习

70
00:05:30,943 --&gt; 00:05:33,988
我最好全天都用在修炼上

71
00:05:53,173 --&gt; 00:05:54,341
晚安，卡塔拉

72
00:05:54,425 --&gt; 00:05:56,009
晚安，索卡

73
00:05:56,135 --&gt; 00:05:57,928
晚安，拓芙

74
00:05:58,053 --&gt; 00:06:00,431
晚安，阿柏，晚安，模模

75
00:06:00,556 --&gt; 00:06:01,974
晚安，阿柏和模...

76
00:06:02,099 --&gt; 00:06:04,017
少废话，赶快睡

77
00:06:21,994 --&gt; 00:06:24,287
你的暴政就要玩完了，烈火王

78
00:06:24,371 --&gt; 00:06:26,540
我今天就要消灭你

79
00:06:26,665 --&gt; 00:06:30,544
这次我可是穿着裤子来的

80
00:06:30,669 --&gt; 00:06:32,504
果然穿了

81
00:06:32,587 --&gt; 00:06:37,175
不过你准备好进行数学测验了吗？

82
00:06:37,259 --&gt; 00:06:38,969
数学测验？

83
00:06:39,052 --&gt; 00:06:42,305
哦，糟了，我完全忘记了

84
00:06:48,311 --&gt; 00:06:50,605
我得做好准备

85
00:06:59,447 --&gt; 00:07:01,908
安昂，现在可是半夜

86
00:07:01,992 --&gt; 00:07:04,035
赶快回去继续睡觉

87
00:07:04,160 --&gt; 00:07:07,205
不过我忘了穿裤子
就连数学测验也忘了

88
00:07:11,376 --&gt; 00:07:12,752
安昂，去睡吧

89
00:07:13,128 --&gt; 00:07:16,047
拜托了，就当是为我

90
00:07:28,685 --&gt; 00:07:30,812
告诉我，你现在最想要的是什么

91
00:07:30,895 --&gt; 00:07:32,730
说来听听

92
00:07:32,814 --&gt; 00:07:37,151
嗯，一个巨大的水果蛋糕
上面要洒满玫瑰花瓣

93
00:07:37,276 --&gt; 00:07:41,447
作为一名王子，这点要求应该难不倒我

94
00:07:41,572 --&gt; 00:07:44,492
你可真好

95
00:07:44,492 --&gt; 00:07:47,078
为这位女士弄一个新鲜的水果蛋糕

96
00:07:47,203 --&gt; 00:07:48,830
上面要洒满玫瑰花瓣

97
00:07:48,913 --&gt; 00:07:50,248
这就去办，殿下

98
00:07:50,331 --&gt; 00:07:53,876
身为皇族真是不赖啊，要风得风，要雨得雨

99
00:07:53,960 --&gt; 00:07:56,295
要是不用搭理那些烦人的国事就好了

100
00:07:56,420 --&gt; 00:07:59,090
那个全天的战事会议你要参加吧

101
00:07:59,215 --&gt; 00:08:01,759
战事会议，我怎么会不知道？

102
00:08:01,884 --&gt; 00:08:03,052
我是听阿祖拉说的

103
00:08:03,177 --&gt; 00:08:05,721
我，我还以为你也要去呢

104
00:08:05,805 --&gt; 00:08:09,225
看来我并不在邀请之列

105
00:08:12,019 --&gt; 00:08:12,687
安昂，快醒醒

106
00:08:13,854 --&gt; 00:08:16,691
起来吧，小懒虫

107
00:08:16,816 --&gt; 00:08:18,859
都已经日上三竿了

108
00:08:18,943 --&gt; 00:08:20,736
你已经睡过头了

109
00:08:20,820 --&gt; 00:08:22,571
你没赶上侵入计划

110
00:08:30,788 --&gt; 00:08:33,833
索卡，快起来，今天到底是几号了?

111
00:08:33,958 --&gt; 00:08:36,210
啥，谁在讲话？

112
00:08:37,878 --&gt; 00:08:42,174
别紧张，离入侵还有两天呢

113
00:08:42,258 --&gt; 00:08:45,344
索卡，你得赶紧起来，好好练习一下你攀岩技巧

114
00:08:45,427 --&gt; 00:08:46,845
说啥？

115
00:08:46,845 --&gt; 00:08:49,932
我梦见有许多火宗士兵在追你

116
00:08:50,015 --&gt; 00:08:51,433
你试图爬上悬崖

117
00:08:51,517 --&gt; 00:08:53,477
可是你爬得太慢，最后被他们抓住了

118
00:08:53,560 --&gt; 00:08:56,563
那不过是个梦罢了，我的攀岩功夫可不是盖的

119
00:08:56,689 --&gt; 00:09:00,317
那就爬那个悬崖试一试，快爬

120
00:09:07,116 --&gt; 00:09:11,036
蠢神通，做的什么蠢梦啊
偏要爬这个蠢悬崖

121
00:09:11,161 --&gt; 00:09:12,037
我爬得可快着呢

122
00:09:13,831 --&gt; 00:09:16,250
别喝！

123
00:09:16,333 --&gt; 00:09:18,585
为啥，水中有毒？

124
00:09:18,669 --&gt; 00:09:21,213
我梦见，咱们正在进行侵入计划的时候

125
00:09:21,338 --&gt; 00:09:23,674
你停下来说要上厕所

126
00:09:23,799 --&gt; 00:09:25,801
你那个小膀胱把我们都拖累死了

127
00:09:25,926 --&gt; 00:09:28,136
你从现在开始最好把头发盘起来

128
00:09:28,261 --&gt; 00:09:30,389
我梦见，你的头发被搅在火车里了，还有...

129
00:09:30,389 --&gt; 00:09:32,224
安昂，我知道你想帮忙

130
00:09:32,265 --&gt; 00:09:34,267
不过你得控制住自己

131
00:09:34,393 --&gt; 00:09:35,644
别再胡话连篇的了

132
00:09:37,938 --&gt; 00:09:43,318
你说的没错，我有点失去理智

133
00:09:48,114 --&gt; 00:09:50,408
我总是害怕自己变得紧张起来

134
00:09:50,534 --&gt; 00:09:52,285
反而搞得自己更紧张了

135
00:09:52,410 --&gt; 00:09:54,704
我感觉自己的焦虑就像个雪球一样越滚越大了

136
00:09:54,829 --&gt; 00:09:56,581
这也不能怪你

137
00:09:56,665 --&gt; 00:09:59,793
你可是要和烈火王决斗，他可是世界的头号大坏蛋

138
00:09:59,918 --&gt; 00:10:01,962
你最好取胜，不然我们也都要玩完

139
00:10:01,962 --&gt; 00:10:03,546
索卡，别在那儿帮倒忙

140
00:10:03,630 --&gt; 00:10:04,798
啥？

141
00:10:04,923 --&gt; 00:10:08,718
我说得没错啊，这事地球人都知道啊

142
00:10:11,012 --&gt; 00:10:13,348
跟我来吧，我有办法

143
00:10:13,473 --&gt; 00:10:16,893
准备好卸下压力的包袱吧

144
00:10:19,896 --&gt; 00:10:23,817
如果在酷热的环境下进行这些
瑜伽的舒展动作，将会有奇效

145
00:10:23,942 --&gt; 00:10:25,193
向上伸展

146
00:10:25,193 --&gt; 00:10:27,362
向着太阳伸展

147
00:10:27,445 --&gt; 00:10:31,824
感受你体内的气路正在慢慢净化

148
00:10:31,950 --&gt; 00:10:34,160
现在闭上你的眼睛

149
00:10:34,285 --&gt; 00:10:35,870
你有什么感觉？

150
00:10:35,954 --&gt; 00:10:38,039
我感觉...

151
00:10:38,122 --&gt; 00:10:39,749
非常的暖和

152
00:10:39,832 --&gt; 00:10:41,834
不错，不错

153
00:10:41,960 --&gt; 00:10:43,294
继续

154
00:10:43,419 --&gt; 00:10:46,673
我感觉一种温暖的感觉在包围着我

155
00:10:46,756 --&gt; 00:10:48,633
这热量

156
00:10:48,758 --&gt; 00:10:53,554
就像我已身处烈火王的皇宫
他向我射了一堆火球一样

157
00:10:53,638 --&gt; 00:10:57,809
全世界都要被火焰吞没了

158
00:10:57,934 --&gt; 00:11:01,395
也许你应该把你的那种焦虑说出来

159
00:11:04,440 --&gt; 00:11:09,070
为什么不直奔主题，谈谈那些困扰你的事情呢？

160
00:11:09,153 --&gt; 00:11:10,863
你知道什么在困扰我

161
00:11:10,988 --&gt; 00:11:13,532
不日我就要大战烈火王

162
00:11:13,658 --&gt; 00:11:18,204
嗯，跟我多讲讲这个...烈火王

163
00:11:18,329 --&gt; 00:11:20,706
为什么你这么怕他？

164
00:11:20,831 --&gt; 00:11:23,042
不是你告诉我的吗，他是世界上头号大坏蛋

165
00:11:23,167 --&gt; 00:11:25,920
只有打败他我才能拯救全世界

166
00:11:26,003 --&gt; 00:11:29,590
嗯，生活有时候就是这样的，不是吗？

167
00:11:29,673 --&gt; 00:11:33,427
我们都试图从恶魔手中拯救这个世界

168
00:11:33,511 --&gt; 00:11:35,888
好吧，不过我怎么样才能感觉好点呢？

169
00:11:35,971 --&gt; 00:11:41,227
试试冲着枕头尖叫吧

170
00:11:58,325 --&gt; 00:11:59,410
好啊，祖祖

171
00:11:59,535 --&gt; 00:12:02,663
如果你也是来享受皇家梳头服务的
那你可要等上一阵了

172
00:12:03,289 --&gt; 00:12:05,624
这么说要开一次大型作战会议喽，对吗？

173
00:12:05,749 --&gt; 00:12:07,626
而且显然我在那儿不会受欢迎

174
00:12:07,710 --&gt; 00:12:10,629
你此言怎讲啊，当然欢迎你去参加了

175
00:12:10,754 --&gt; 00:12:11,422
哦，是吗？

176
00:12:11,463 --&gt; 00:12:13,966
那你为何不来通知我一下呢

177
00:12:14,091 --&gt; 00:12:16,552
哦，祖寇，耍什么小脸子嘛

178
00:12:16,635 --&gt; 00:12:18,512
父皇当然想让你列席会议啊

179
00:12:18,595 --&gt; 00:12:20,264
哪里还用什么邀请

180
00:12:20,389 --&gt; 00:12:23,350
很显然你必定要参与那次会议的嘛

181
00:12:23,475 --&gt; 00:12:25,227
那，你被邀请了吗？

182
00:12:25,352 --&gt; 00:12:27,896
当然啦，我可是公主

183
00:12:27,980 --&gt; 00:12:29,648
我还是王子哩

184
00:12:29,773 --&gt; 00:12:32,609
没错啊，别像个偏执的小孩一样

185
00:12:32,609 --&gt; 00:12:34,236
去开会不就得了

186
00:12:34,361 --&gt; 00:12:36,530
算了，我不会去的

187
00:12:39,867 --&gt; 00:12:43,704
好吧，你需要的是一次老式的背部推拿

188
00:12:43,787 --&gt; 00:12:45,789
这对缓解压力有奇效

189
00:12:45,914 --&gt; 00:12:48,375
那开始吧

190
00:12:53,130 --&gt; 00:12:58,176
拓芙，我身上都被弄青了

191
00:13:00,595 --&gt; 00:13:04,099
抱歉，忘了你的皮肤太嫩了

192
00:13:04,224 --&gt; 00:13:09,312
那咱们再试试其他办法吧

193
00:13:09,396 --&gt; 00:13:11,398
针灸咋样

194
00:13:16,862 --&gt; 00:13:19,573
祖寇，不就是个破会嘛

195
00:13:19,698 --&gt; 00:13:21,366
谁在乎啊？

196
00:13:21,491 --&gt; 00:13:22,784
我不在乎

197
00:13:22,909 --&gt; 00:13:24,953
那这不很好吗

198
00:13:25,036 --&gt; 00:13:27,330
我是说，你干嘛要想去那种会议呢？

199
00:13:27,455 --&gt; 00:13:31,001
难道你忘了上次会议之后发生的事了吗？
（上次会后，祖寇和欧宰在烈火祭队战）

200
00:13:31,126 --&gt; 00:13:33,420
我知道

201
00:13:33,503 --&gt; 00:13:36,840
你知道什么会让你好过点吗？

202
00:13:36,965 --&gt; 00:13:38,425
咱们叫点外卖吧

203
00:13:38,425 --&gt; 00:13:42,554
我都饿死了，自己就能吃下一碟水果蛋糕

204
00:13:42,679 --&gt; 00:13:47,267
不如咱们乘轿子去城里转转吧，兜它两圈

205
00:13:54,774 --&gt; 00:13:56,776
伙计们，多谢你们的帮助

206
00:13:56,860 --&gt; 00:14:01,072
这么说你觉得好点了，那就好好的睡一觉吧

207
00:14:01,072 --&gt; 00:14:06,119
呃，我想我稍微觉得好过一点了

208
00:14:06,244 --&gt; 00:14:06,953
也许吧

209
00:14:07,120 --&gt; 00:14:10,289
那我们就大功告成了

210
00:15:27,074 --&gt; 00:15:28,867
怎么了，安昂？

211
00:15:28,951 --&gt; 00:15:30,577
又是个噩梦

212
00:15:30,661 --&gt; 00:15:33,038
那些噩梦越来越糟了

213
00:15:33,163 --&gt; 00:15:36,500
看来有必要咱们再进行一个疗程

214
00:15:36,583 --&gt; 00:15:38,627
不，那不会管用的

215
00:15:38,752 --&gt; 00:15:40,170
啥也不管用

216
00:15:40,295 --&gt; 00:15:42,381
我能做的只有一件事

217
00:15:42,464 --&gt; 00:15:45,634
我只能在入侵计划前不睡不休了

218
00:15:54,059 --&gt; 00:15:55,686
入侵...

219
00:15:55,811 --&gt; 00:15:58,313
大家都准备好了

220
00:15:58,397 --&gt; 00:16:00,357
你看起来不太好

221
00:16:00,440 --&gt; 00:16:03,402
不如躺下来眯上一会儿吧

222
00:16:03,527 --&gt; 00:16:06,488
我不是跟你说过吗，我睡不着

223
00:16:06,613 --&gt; 00:16:09,408
安昂，整夜不睡会搞垮你的

224
00:16:09,491 --&gt; 00:16:12,536
事实上，整夜没睡让我有时间能够思考

225
00:16:12,577 --&gt; 00:16:15,080
卡塔拉，我想通了一些大事

226
00:16:15,163 --&gt; 00:16:16,665
什么大事？

227
00:16:16,790 --&gt; 00:16:19,000
现在一切在我看来都是那么地清晰

228
00:16:19,084 --&gt; 00:16:22,379
弄清为什么要进行入侵计划是首要大事

229
00:16:22,462 --&gt; 00:16:25,382
我这么做是要拯救世界，不过更重要的是...

230
00:16:25,507 --&gt; 00:16:27,759
我要为了我爱的人而战

231
00:16:27,884 --&gt; 00:16:30,220
卡塔拉，我要为你而战

232
00:16:30,303 --&gt; 00:16:32,597
安昂，你在说什么啊？

233
00:16:32,722 --&gt; 00:16:35,892
我是说...我爱你

234
00:16:43,900 --&gt; 00:16:46,069
我们这是干嘛啊？

235
00:16:46,194 --&gt; 00:16:50,240
其实我们的心好久之前就已经在一起了

236
00:16:50,323 --&gt; 00:16:53,076
亲爱的，你是我永远的爱

237
00:16:53,201 --&gt; 00:16:55,245
安昂

238
00:16:55,745 --&gt; 00:16:59,374
我只是问你要不要眯一觉

239
00:16:59,499 --&gt; 00:17:03,002
哦，我想我有点走神了
可能做了个白日梦

240
00:17:03,127 --&gt; 00:17:06,673
你梦见什么了？

241
00:17:06,756 --&gt; 00:17:08,758
呃，在水下生活

242
00:17:08,841 --&gt; 00:17:10,885
听起来挺有趣的

243
00:17:18,643 --&gt; 00:17:21,020
祖寇殿下，大家都在等你呢

244
00:17:21,104 --&gt; 00:17:22,897
什么？

245
00:17:22,939 --&gt; 00:17:26,150
陆、海军司令长，军机部长以及公主殿下都到了

246
00:17:26,275 --&gt; 00:17:27,944
只有您仍未到场

247
00:17:28,069 --&gt; 00:17:31,572
这么说，父皇想让我参加会议？

248
00:17:31,697 --&gt; 00:17:34,617
殿下，烈火王说您抵达后会议才会开始

249
00:17:43,334 --&gt; 00:17:46,712
接招吧，烈火王

250
00:17:51,968 --&gt; 00:17:53,886
嘿，我正在这儿给阿柏做铠甲呢

251
00:17:54,011 --&gt; 00:17:56,263
你不是想让它赤身裸体的去打仗吧

252
00:17:56,389 --&gt; 00:17:58,015
他可是你的野牛

253
00:17:58,099 --&gt; 00:17:59,767
欧宰的防御毫无破绽

254
00:17:59,892 --&gt; 00:18:02,978
我得尝试不同的攻法

255
00:18:12,488 --&gt; 00:18:14,907
还在自命不凡呢吗，烈火王？

256
00:18:15,157 --&gt; 00:18:18,494
哎，孩子，开来你真得要输啊

257
00:18:18,619 --&gt; 00:18:23,165
模模，你听见什么动静没？

258
00:18:23,249 --&gt; 00:18:26,168
没，不过我刚才说了句话

259
00:18:27,336 --&gt; 00:18:30,673
伙计，我的朋友，跟你打个比方吧
现在的你就像上面少了几个李子的水果派

260
00:18:38,889 --&gt; 00:18:41,642
这样还差不多

261
00:18:41,767 --&gt; 00:18:45,729
我刚才可能是太累了，你怎么能开口说话呢

262
00:18:46,438 --&gt; 00:18:49,233
哦，模模，我来跟你解释一下吧

263
00:18:58,951 --&gt; 00:19:00,285
安昂？

264
00:19:00,410 --&gt; 00:19:03,622
我们都开始有点担心你了

265
00:19:03,747 --&gt; 00:19:05,916
你好些天没睡了

266
00:19:06,041 --&gt; 00:19:09,044
现在你的行为明显有些怪异了

267
00:19:09,127 --&gt; 00:19:11,963
你得学会照顾自己

268
00:19:12,047 --&gt; 00:19:14,549
你不能再这样下去了

269
00:19:14,633 --&gt; 00:19:18,345
我很感激你们所说的

270
00:19:18,470 --&gt; 00:19:20,847
不过那些压力和恶梦...

271
00:19:20,972 --&gt; 00:19:21,848
我真的是无法忍受了

272
00:19:21,973 --&gt; 00:19:24,726
只有保持不睡才能克服它们

273
00:19:24,851 --&gt; 00:19:27,062
没错，别来烦这个孩子

274
00:19:27,187 --&gt; 00:19:29,314
嘿，你算老几啊？

275
00:19:29,397 --&gt; 00:19:31,608
伙计们，别这样

276
00:19:31,691 --&gt; 00:19:34,152
不，我烦透这家伙了

277
00:19:34,236 --&gt; 00:19:36,571
总是口无遮拦，对我发号施令

278
00:19:36,571 --&gt; 00:19:37,948
哦，想挑衅是吗？

279
00:19:38,031 --&gt; 00:19:39,407
不服就放马过来吧

280
00:19:39,532 --&gt; 00:19:42,077
索卡，我们该怎么办啊？

281
00:19:42,160 --&gt; 00:19:42,952
什么怎么办？

282
00:19:43,078 --&gt; 00:19:46,539
你自己看哪

283
00:20:04,641 --&gt; 00:20:07,185
阿柏，阿柏，阿柏

284
00:20:07,310 --&gt; 00:20:09,938
模模，模模，模模

285
00:20:19,280 --&gt; 00:20:21,949
别打了，伙计们，咱们可是一家人啊

286
00:20:22,492 --&gt; 00:20:26,829
***脉轮，脉轮，谁人不爱***

287
00:20:26,954 --&gt; 00:20:29,749
***脉轮，脉轮***

288
00:20:29,874 --&gt; 00:20:32,668
***脉轮三明治，美味无法挡，好吃~***

289
00:21:00,196 --&gt; 00:21:02,865
我还是跳进冰瀑布里冷静冷静吧

290
00:21:12,249 --&gt; 00:21:14,585
会开得怎么样？

291
00:21:14,668 --&gt; 00:21:18,255
我到场时，大家都很欢迎我

292
00:21:18,339 --&gt; 00:21:20,341
我父亲还给我留了个座位

293
00:21:20,466 --&gt; 00:21:22,218
他让我坐在他身边

294
00:21:22,301 --&gt; 00:21:24,845
我成为了他的左膀右臂

295
00:21:24,970 --&gt; 00:21:26,805
祖寇，那真是太好了

296
00:21:26,889 --&gt; 00:21:27,890
你一定很高兴吧

297
00:21:33,646 --&gt; 00:21:37,191
与会期间，我是个完美的王子

298
00:21:37,316 --&gt; 00:21:40,819
是父皇期盼的那种皇子

299
00:21:40,903 --&gt; 00:21:43,822
不过那并不是我

300
00:21:59,379 --&gt; 00:22:01,882
哦，看哪，又是一个幻觉

301
00:22:01,965 --&gt; 00:22:04,593
居然看见了个用云彩做的床

302
00:22:04,676 --&gt; 00:22:06,219
嘿，那可不是假的

303
00:22:06,303 --&gt; 00:22:08,221
我们可是做了几个时辰呢

304
00:22:08,347 --&gt; 00:22:09,640
这是我们专门为你做的

305
00:22:09,723 --&gt; 00:22:11,767
睡个好觉也许你就不会发神经了

306
00:22:11,850 --&gt; 00:22:13,185
希望是那样

307
00:22:13,226 --&gt; 00:22:16,730
你们一直劝说我需要好好睡一觉
不过我就是睡不着

308
00:22:16,813 --&gt; 00:22:17,731
入侵行动就在明天

309
00:22:17,898 --&gt; 00:22:19,399
安昂

310
00:22:19,524 --&gt; 00:22:21,485
不，卡塔拉，我还有些东西没学会呢

311
00:22:21,610 --&gt; 00:22:24,988
我不需要睡觉，我需要的是继续修炼

312
00:22:25,071 --&gt; 00:22:27,449
快，攻击我

313
00:22:27,532 --&gt; 00:22:29,034
我不会攻击你的

314
00:22:29,159 --&gt; 00:22:30,702
需要我动手吗？

315
00:22:30,827 --&gt; 00:22:32,162
听我说

316
00:22:32,245 --&gt; 00:22:35,040
我们相遇的那天开始，你就一直在修行

317
00:22:35,123 --&gt; 00:22:36,917
我们见证了你的进步

318
00:22:37,000 --&gt; 00:22:39,294
你聪明，勇敢又坚强

319
00:22:39,419 --&gt; 00:22:41,421
真的吗？

320
00:22:41,546 --&gt; 00:22:42,964
我们都这么认为

321
00:22:43,048 --&gt; 00:22:45,467
你能行的，你已经准备好了

322
00:22:45,550 --&gt; 00:22:48,261
你就是救世主，亮脚趾

323
00:22:48,345 --&gt; 00:22:52,390
谢了，伙计们

324
00:22:58,855 --&gt; 00:23:00,732
你们知道吗？

325
00:23:00,857 --&gt; 00:23:03,693
我想我准备好了

326
00:23:11,826 --&gt; 00:23:14,412
烈火王，今天我就要结束你的暴政

327
00:23:14,495 --&gt; 00:23:16,956
真的吗，你真得要除掉我吗？

328
00:23:16,956 --&gt; 00:23:20,251
不过你裤子都没穿，看你怎么跟我打

329
00:23:20,376 --&gt; 00:23:23,921
不，欧宰，没穿裤子的人是你

330
00:23:26,924 --&gt; 00:23:28,634
不

331
00:23:28,760 --&gt; 00:23:31,804
我以后该怎么见人啊！

气和国

5
00:00:10,600 --&gt; 00:00:14,044
很久以前，这四大国和谐共处

6
00:00:14,527 --&gt; 00:00:18,532
然而，烈火国发起的战争结束了和平

7
00:00:18,955 --&gt; 00:00:22,749
只有同时掌握四种元素的降世神通才能结束战争

8
00:00:22,750 --&gt; 00:00:26,056
然而在大家最需要他的时候，他却消失了

9
00:00:26,432 --&gt; 00:00:29,824
100年后，我和哥哥发现了转世的降世神通

10
00:00:30,198 --&gt; 00:00:32,066
他是个御气师，名叫“安昂”

11
00:00:32,101 --&gt; 00:00:34,474
尽管他的御气术着实了得

12
00:00:34,509 --&gt; 00:00:37,135
在拯救苍生之前，他要学的还有很多

13
00:00:38,134 --&gt; 00:00:41,127
但是我坚信 安昂能拯救这个世界

降世神通 前情提要

16
00:00:49,541 --&gt; 00:00:51,567
没有了土强国军队的兵力支持

17
00:00:51,602 --&gt; 00:00:52,912
我们无法发动大规模的侵入行动

18
00:00:52,947 --&gt; 00:00:56,574
不过日食仍会使火宗人丧失抵抗的能力

19
00:00:56,722 --&gt; 00:00:58,686
所以我们正在谋划一次小规模的侵入

20
00:00:58,721 --&gt; 00:01:02,486
整个队伍由我们的朋友和土强国的睦邻组成

21
00:01:02,568 --&gt; 00:01:05,218
我说，你们一直在劝我睡觉

22
00:01:05,219 --&gt; 00:01:08,008
可我就是睡不着，入侵行动明天就要开始了

23
00:01:08,009 --&gt; 00:01:10,572
自打我们见面的第一天你就在修行

24
00:01:10,660 --&gt; 00:01:12,811
你能做的到的，你已经准备好了

25
00:01:13,149 --&gt; 00:01:15,097
与会期间，我是个完美的皇子

26
00:01:15,330 --&gt; 00:01:16,955
我是那个父王所期望的儿子

27
00:01:17,115 --&gt; 00:01:18,435
不过那个人并不是我
