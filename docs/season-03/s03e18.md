      [Introduction sequence]

      [“Previously on Avatar” sequence, including clips from The Ember Island
      Players, The Avatar State, The Awakening, The Avatar and The Fire Lord,
      The Day of Black Sun Part 1 &amp; 2, The Boiling Rock Part 1 &amp; 2 and The
      Southern Raiders]

      Act I

      (The episode opens up to an overhead view Fire Lord Ozai’s old beach house
      on Ember Island. Cut to Aang’s boot shifting to the side into a stance.
      Camera zooms out to reveal a full body shot of Aang practicing in front of
      the beach house with the rest of the Gaang resting on steps in the
      background. Aang proceeds to firebend arcs with his arms, right leg
      followed by his left leg. He walks towards the camera as he does so. Then
      he firebends a flurry of small shot, circles rapidly with his arms. Cut to
      Zuko who is looking sternly at Aang’s training with his arms crossed.)

      Zuko: More ferocious!

      (Aang’s fist firebends into the camera’s view and his head comes into view
      as he walks forward. He has an intense look of concentration on his face.)

      Zuko: Imagine striking through your opponent’s heart.

      (Aang firebends another big shot of fire towards the camera and turns
      towards Zuko with his arms in a frustrated gesture.)

      Aang: Ugh! I’m trying.
      Zuko: Now let me hear you roar like a tiger-dillo!

      (Aang turns back to the camera instantly, stretches his arms and roars
      rather softly with weak streams of fire coming out from his palm and
      mouth. Aang grins sheepishly at his weak attempt.)

      Zuko: That sounded pathetic! (Cut back to Zuko lashing out) I said roar!

      (Cut to Aang’s backview. Camera quickly cuts to Aang’s frontview. He turns
      around, roars ferociously and firebends rather strongly out of both hands
      and his mouth. The camera changes to an overhead shot to show the
      intensity of the flames. Momo can be seen scurrying towards Zuko. Cut to
      Zuko’s legs as Momo seeks refuge behind them. Camera moves up to show Zuko
      nodding his head in approval. Cut to Katara holding two watermelons with
      straws in them.)

      Katara: Who wants a nice, cool glass of watermelon juice‌

      (Cut back to Aang who comically has an exclamation mark over his head. His
      eyes widen with greed.)

      Aang: Ooo, ooo, (turns around) me, me, me! (he begins to run towards the
      house)
      Zuko: Hey, (Zuko’s hand comes into screen and holds Aang back by his
      robes) your lesson’s not over yet! (Aang tries to break free of his grip
      and his tongue comically sticks out to show that he is thirsty.) Get back
      here.

      (Aang gets pulled up and the camera zooms out to show Zuko pulling him up
      effortlessly with Aang looking rather disappointed.)

      Suki: (off screen) Come on, Zuko. (Cut to Suki and Sokka lounging on the
      steps. Sokka drinks his watermelon juice and looks on.) Just take a break.
      What’s the big deal‌
      Zuko: Fine.

      (He releases Aang and Aang dashes off, leaving a trail of dust behind.)

      Zuko: If you want to lounge around (Cut to the top of the steps to show
      Aang running towards Katara and accepting the watermelon with glee and
      proceeds to slurp the juice noisily and greedily) like a bunch of
      snail-sloths all day, then go ahead! (Zuko turns and walks away)
      Sokka: (off screen) Maybe Zuko’s right. (Cut back to Sokka.) Sitting
      around the house has made us pretty lazy. But I know (lays his watermelon
      aside and stands up slowly) just the thing to change that. Beach party!

      (He removes his outer coat, revealing a pair of brown undershorts
      underneath and dives excitedly out of the camera’s view. Camera changes
      scene to the ocean to show that he entered the water with a splash. Sokka
      surfaces with seaweed on his head and he blows water from his mouth. He
      grins goofily.

      Cut to Katara jumping off the shore into the water as she waterbends a
      surfboard made of ice. She proceeds to surf as the water displaced by her
      movements splashes against the camera. Cut to the underside of the ice
      surfboard as Katara jumps off a wave of water and her image is silhouetted
      against the Sun. She lands back into the water with ease and continues
      surfing. Cut to Suki laying on a beach mat in her red beach outfit. She
      smiles as Sokka walks into screen carrying seaweed in his arms. She looks
      puzzled as Sokka grabs empty pails and exits the screen before re-entering
      a spilt second later with the buckets full of water and a huge smile
      plastered on his face.

      Cut to Aang who is holding a big piece of wood in his hand. Camera zooms
      out to show him placing the piece of wood as a horn into his sand
      sculpture of Appa. )

      Aang: (raises both arms) Check out my Appa sand sculpture. (Camera zooms
      and shows the real Appa growling at the sight. Toph walks into screen.)
      Toph: Not bad, baldy. But I’ve been working on my sandbending. (stretches
      and cracks her fingers) You’re gonna love this.

      (Cut to the area in front of Toph. She moves her hands and sends clouds of
      sand dust everywhere. The dust clears to reveal a miniature replica of Ba
      Sing Se in the sand. Cut to the top view to show the huge Earth King’s
      palace in the middle with tiny houses surrounding it. Aang walks towards
      it and kneels down, scrutinising the details.)

      Aang: Whoa. (he looks at the sand replica of Earth King Kuei and his bear,
      Bosco) Wow, you even made a little Earth King and Bosco.

      (Cut to Sokka who is frantically carving at his sculpture, sending specks
      of sand flying everywhere. Toph &amp; Aang walk into screen behind him.)

      Toph: Try and top that, Sokka.
      Sokka: Ta-da!

      (He reveals his sand sculpture with seaweed for hair, stones for eyes, a
      red starfish for a nose, and some stones and seashells as a smile.)

      Aang: Is that a blubbering, blob monster‌
      Sokka: No, (stomps the ground defensively) it’s Suki. (Cut to Aang with an
      animated look of shock and surprise on his face as both he and Toph burst
      into a fit of laughter.)
      Toph: Suki, we’ll all understand if you break up with him over this.
      Suki: I think it’s sweet. (Sokka runs and slides into screen on his knees
      as he grabs Suki by her shoulders and kisses her on the cheek.)
      Aang: But it doesn’t even look like…

      (A burst of fire hits the sand sculpture, sending waves of send
      everywhere. Aang yells in surprise and shields himself from the impact.
      The dust clears and Aang looks up at the cliff. Cut to Zuko running and
      jumping off the cliff, firebending at Aang at the same time. Aang narrowly
      misses the flames and jumps across Toph’s sand sculpture. Cut to the
      bottom of the sculpture as Aang flies across it. A ball of fire hits one
      of the sand houses, breaking it into a wave of sand instantly. Aang lands
      on the other side near his sand sculpture as he turns around and looks
      frightened. He then jumps over his sand sculpture.

      Cut to the inside of Toph’s sand sculpture as Zuko lands in front of it.
      He runs on the sculpture towards Aang. Aang peeks out from behind Appa’s
      sand head.)

      Aang: What are you doing‌!
      Zuko: (Cut to Zuko’s boot stopping in the sand. Cut to Zuko’s face.)
      Teaching you a lesson!

      (He firebends towards the Appa sculpture. Aang looks away before the
      camera zooms out to show him jumping away from the impact. The stream of
      fire “cuts” the Appa sculpture in half, destroying it into a pile of sand.

      Cut to Zuko’s sideview as Aang lands a distance away from him. Zuko turns
      and firebends towards Aang but he misses as Aang jumps onto the cliff.
      Zuko firebends towards the cliff repeatedly as Aang struggles to run
      across the uneven surface. Zuko’s last blast shatters the top part of the
      cliff into rubble. Cut to an overhead shot of Zuko as he runs towards the
      cliff and proceeds to scale it.

      Cut to Katara who surfs back to shore.)

      Katara: What happened‌
      Sokka: Zuko’s gone crazy! I made a sand sculpture of Suki (tries to pick
      up the fallen sand to mould the sculpture back into shape) and he
      destroyed it! Oh, and he’s attacking Aang.

      (Suki grabs Sokka and they run back to help Aang.

      Cut back to Aang with Zuko hot on his heel. Zuko firebends at him but Aang
      jumps out of the way in time. The fire clears and Zuko is still chasing
      after Aang angrily. Cut to the side of a huge rock as Aang runs to the top
      of it and jumps off before Zuko sends strong blasts of fire at the rock,
      disintegrating it into pieces. Aang grabs onto the top of a trunk of a
      nearby tree as Zuko jumps off the rock and somersaults to the bottom.

      Cut to Zuko landing on the sand with a roll and firebending at the top of
      the tree. Aang jumps away. Camera zooms out to show that the tree has
      caught fire and Aang lands somewhere on the beach house’s roof, out of
      view. Cut to Zuko who jumps onto the beach house’s railings as he scales
      and flips his way to the roof. Cut to rooftop as Zuko’s head appears into
      screen and he pushes himself with his arm and lands in a stance. Camera
      zooms out to show Aang waiting for him in a similar stance.)

      Aang: Get a grip before I blast you off this roof!
      Zuko: Go ahead and do it!

      (He then firebends with his fists and feet one after another. Cut to Aang
      sliding down the roof as jets of fire sets the path he was on alight. Aang
      reaches the end of the roof and he grabs onto the edge as he swings
      himself into a nearby room through the window. He slides across the floor
      on his knees to hide behind a drawer. A huge blast of fire through the
      roof sends some debris into the room and Zuko lands. He gets into a stance
      and looks around the room warily. Aang then kicks the drawer towards Zuko.
      He blocks it by disintegrating the drawer into pieces with a firebending
      punch.

      Cut to the end of the corridor as Aang runs out from the room followed
      shortly by Zuko. Zuko firebends huge whips and arcs of flame around
      himself. Cut to Zuko’s back view as he sends the tunnel of fire towards
      Aang. Cut to Aang running away desperately and time slows down as Aang
      looks back to find himself being slowly engulfed by the fire. Time resumes
      back to normal as he airbends the fire away, creating a safe space for him
      to land on without get burnt. Cut to Aang’s face as the fire reflects off
      his eyes.)

      Aang: (furiously) Enough!

      (He airbends a huge tunnel of air towards Zuko, extinguishing the flames
      at the same time. Cut to Zuko yelling in surprise as he gets pushed back
      by the strong air pressure. Cut to the outside of the house as its side
      gets ripped open by the visible tunnel of wind, throwing out some wooden
      debris along with Zuko. The sound effects suggests that Zuko is sliding
      down some tree branches. Cut to the grass as Zuko lands on it and attempts
      to stand up, grabbing his head and moaning slightly. The others come into
      screen behind Zuko.)

      Katara: What’s wrong with you‌! (Aang jumps off the balcony and lands near
      the group.) You could have hurt Aang.
      Zuko: What’s wrong with me‌ What’s wrong with all of you! (Cut to Zuko’s
      front view as he stands up and throws his arm to the side in anger) How
      can you sit around having beach parties when Sozin’s Comet (Camera slowly
      pans through the rest of the group who have guilty looks on their faces)
      is only 3 days away!

      (Cut to a top view of the group.)

      Zuko: Why are you all looking at me like I’m crazy‌
      Aang: About Sozin’s Comet… (takes a step forward) I was actually going to
      wait to fight the Fire Lord until after it came.
      Zuko: After‌
      Aang: I’m not ready. (looks unconfident and unsure) I need more time to
      master firebending.
      Toph: And frankly, your earthbending could still use some work too. (Aang
      looks disappointed)
      Zuko: So… You all knew Aang was going to wait‌
      Sokka: Honestly, if Aang tries to fight the Fire Lord right now, he’s
      gonna lose. No offence.
      Katara: The whole point of fighting the Fire Lord before the comet was to
      stop the Fire Nation from winning the war. But they pretty much won the
      war when they took Ba Sing Se. Things can’t get any worse. (drops her head
      in worry)
      Zuko: You’re wrong. (turns head towards camera) It’s about to get worse
      than you can even imagine.

      (Scene fades to the corridor leading to the Fire Lord’s war room.)

      Zuko: (voiceover) The day before the eclipse, my Father asked me to attend
      an important war meeting. (Zuko’s servants help him wear and tighten his
      armor shoulder pads as he walks towards the room) It was what I dreamed
      about (the servants bow in respect) and wanted (Cut to Zuko standing in
      front of the war room’s curtain entrance) for so many years. My Father
      (Camera slowly zooms in on Zuko’s back and he raises both hands) had
      finally accepted me back. (Cut to the opposite side of the curtain as Zuko
      thrusts the curtain apart, revealing his presence. He walks forward. Cut
      to the top of Fire Lord Ozai’s throne to show the whole room. There is a
      map of the Earth Kingdom spread out on a table with generals seated around
      the length of the table.)

      Fire Lord Ozai: Welcome, Prince Zuko. We waited for you.

      (Cut to the generals glancing at Zuko. Cut to full view of the throne.
      Azula is already seated on Ozai’s left. Ozai gestures to his son to take
      his seat and Zuko bows before sitting down. Cut to a close up sideview of
      Ozai watching his son.)

      Fire Lord Ozai: General Shinu, your report.
      General Shinu: (Cut to Shinu who bows his head in acknowledgement) Thank
      you, sir. (He stands up) Ba Sing Se is still under our control. (Cut to an
      area behind Ozai and shows Shinu slowly pacing his way to the end of the
      table) However, earthbender rebellions have prevented us from achieving
      total victory in the Earth Kingdom.
      Fire Lord Ozai: (Cut to Ozai who frowns at the news) What is your
      recommendation‌
      General Shinu: Our army is spread too thin but once the eclipse is over
      and the invasion defeated, we should transfer more domestic forces into
      the Earth Kingdom.

      (Cut back to a close up sideview shot of Ozai. Zuko is slouching and
      appears uninterested.)

      Fire Lord Ozai: Hmm… (turns his head to his son) Prince Zuko, (Zuko looks
      at his father) you’ve been among the Earth Kingdom commoners. Do you think
      that adding more troops will stop these rebellions‌
      Zuko: (Cut to the front view of Zuko as he drops his head and thinks) The
      people of the Earth Kingdom are proud and strong. They can endure anything
      as long as they have hope.
      Fire Lord Ozai: Yes, you’re right. (Cut to a close up shot of his face as
      he gives an evil, lethal look) We need to destroy their hope.
      Zuko: (Cut to a sideview of Father and son) Well, that’s not exactly what
      I…
      Azula: (interrupts) I think you should take their precious hope (fingers
      her fringe and tosses it aside without a care) and the rest of their land,
      (looks at the table fiercely) and burn it all to the ground.

      (The princess crosses her arms and smiles at her own brilliant
      suggestion.)

      Fire Lord Ozai: Yes… (Smiles evilly) Yes, you’re right, Azula. (Cut to
      Azula who smiles at her Father’s acknowledgement of her plan. Ozai gets up
      and walks towards the table.) Sozin’s Comet is almost upon us (Cut to a
      full view of the table and throne and Ozai stops near the edge of the
      table) and on that day it will endow us with the strength and power of a
      hundred Suns. No bender will stand a chance against us.
      General Shinu: (Cut to an area behind Ozai’s back as his generals and
      Shinu look on) What are you suggesting, sir‌
      Fire Lord Ozai: When the comet last came, my grandfather, Fire Lord Sozin,
      used it to wipe out the Air Nomads. Now, I will use its power to end the
      Earth Kingdom. (Cut to Zuko and the camera slowly zooms in on him. He is
      shocked as his Father’s cruel revelation.) Permanently. (Cut to the front
      view of Ozai as he grins from ear to ear and walks across the table) From
      our airships, (Cut to the Earth Kingdom area of the map and the camera
      slowly zooms out as Ozai’s shadow covers the East side of the continent)
      we will rain fire over their lands. A fire that will destroy everything.
      (Ozai walks across from one side of the map to middle of it) And out of
      the ashes, (he opens his arms to the side) a new World will be born. A
      World in which all the lands are Fire Nation and I am

      (Cut back to the front view of Ozai as he raises his arms high) the
      supreme ruler of everything! (the generals burst into applause.)

      Zuko: (Cut to the sideview of Zuko’s scarred eye as he looks down) I
      wanted to speak out against this horrifying plan. (Cut to an area behind
      Zuko’s head as it slowly zooms in on the back of his head. The generals
      are still applauding and Ozai basks in the excitement.) But I’m ashamed to
      say I didn’t. (Cut back to present day Zuko) My whole life I struggled to
      gain my Father’s love and acceptance. (Cut to show the whole Gaang looking
      at Zuko who is sitting on a rock) But once I had it, I realized I lost
      myself getting there. (Katara raises her hand to her forehead in despair)
      I forgotten who I was.

      (Katara drops down to the ground on her knees. Sokka grabs Suki by the
      shoulder in an assuring gesture.)

      Katara: I can’t believe this. (shakes her head)
      Sokka: I always knew that the Fire Lord was a bad guy but his plan is just
      pure evil. (Suki shakes her head)
      Aang: What am I going to do‌
      Zuko: I know you’re scared. (he stands up and walks towards Aang) And I
      know that you’re not ready to save the World. But if you don’t defeat the
      Fire Lord before the comet comes, (Cut to Zuko who is looking very
      serious) there won’t be a World to save anymore.

      (Camera slowly zooms in on Aang who looks stunned and blur. Cut to
      commercial break.)

      Act II

      (Scene returns with Aang facing the group.)

      Aang: Why (points to self) didn’t you tell me (turns around and walks off
      screen) about your Dad’s crazy plan sooner‌
      Zuko: (takes a step forward) I didn’t think I had to. I assumed that you
      were still going to fight him before the comet. No one told me you decided
      to wait!
      Aang: This is bad. (places both hands on head in despair) This is really,
      (shakes his head and drops to his knees) really bad. (Cut to a close up of
      Aang whose face is full of worry and despair)
      Katara: (off screen) Aang, you (Cut to a side shot where Katara is
      standing behind Aang. He looks up at her) don’t have to do this alone.
      (Toph and Zuko walk into screen)
      Toph: Yeah. (Suki and Sokka join in) If we all fight the Fire Lord
      together, we got a shot at taking him down.
      Sokka: Alright! (raises arm in enthusiasm) Team Avatar is back! (points
      confidently) Air. (Cut to Aang) Water. (Cut to Katara) Earth. (Cut to
      Toph) Fire. (Cut to Zuko) Fan (picks up a palm leaf in a shape of a fan
      from the ground into Suki’s hands) and sword! (He thrusts a blade of leaf
      into the air. The background music makes a comical sound and the tip of
      the leaf falls)
      Aang: Fighting the Fire Lord is going to be the hardest thing we’ve ever
      done together. But I wouldn’t want to do it any other way. (The group
      laughs and they engage in a group hug but Zuko remains standing where he
      is)
      Toph: Yeah.
      Sokka: Alright.
      Katara: Get over here, Zuko. Being part of the group also means being part
      of group hugs.

      (Zuko looks to the side with a “Do I have to this‌” look on his face and
      fits into the opening Suki &amp; Toph created. Appa growls off screen, the
      Gaang looks up and they get tackled to the ground by the giant sky bison.
      Momo chatters away on Appa’s head.

      Cut to an overhead view of the courtyard in the beach house.)

      Zuko: There’s one technique you need (Cut to a close up shot of Zuko
      standing in front of Aang. Katara and Momo sit at the side, spectating) to
      know before facing my Father. How to redirect lightning. (Aang grins with
      anticipation) If you let the energy in your own body flow, (He stretches
      his left arm out and the fingers on his right hand touch the fingers on
      his left hand and swiftly traces a path down his arm, shoulder, stomach
      and back out the other side) the lightning will follow it. (His left hand
      touches his right, they are parallel to each other) You turn your
      opponent’s energy against them.

      (He repeats the motion to the left side of his body.)

      Aang: That’s like waterbending.
      Zuko: Exactly. My Uncle (Aang begins to mimic Zuko’s movements) invented
      this technique himself by studying waterbenders.
      Aang: So… Have you ever redirected lightning before‌
      Zuko: Once. Against my Father.
      Aang: What did it feel like‌ (Zuko stops whatever he is doing and does a
      cool down motion with his hands)
      Zuko: Exhilarating. (Cut to a flashback of Ozai throwing lightning at Zuko
      and he re-directing it back during their confrontation in “The Eclipse”)
      But terrifying. (Cut back to Aang who has raised both arms eagerly to his
      chest but his face falls when Zuko says those two words) You feel so
      powerful (Aang’s hands drops back to the side. He slouches with
      disappointment) holding that much energy in your body. But you know that
      you make the wrong move, it’s over.
      Aang: Heh. (laughs nervously) Well, not over over, right‌ I mean there’s
      always Katara and a little spirit water (moves his hand in a watery
      movement) action… Am I right‌ (turns to Katara)
      Katara: (matter-of-factly) Actually I used it all up after Azula shot you.

      Aang: Oh.
      Zuko: (stares at Aang seriously) You’ll have to take the Fire Lord’s life.
      Before he takes yours.
      Aang: Yeah… I’ll just do that.

      (Cut to an overhead view of the courtyard as Zuko walks away. Fade to an
      area full of rocks at dusk.)

      Sokka: (off screen) Gather round Team Avatar. (Cut to a watermelon with
      some face carvings resembling a jack-o-lantern being dropped onto a wooden
      structure with a red cloth draped over it. Camera zooms out to reveal
      Sokka standing in front of the Melon Lord and the rest of the group
      walking towards him and proceeding to sit in a circle) In order to take
      out the Fire Lord, or in this case, the “Melon Lord”, our timing has to be
      perfect. (He kneels down) First, Suki and I will draw his fire. (He takes
      a stick and draws a line curving to the left towards the melon symbol on
      the ground) Then, Katara and Zuko (He draws a straight line in the middle)
      charge in with some liquidy hot offence and while the “Melon Lord” is
      distracted, Aang swoops in and “BAM!” (He draws a line curving to the
      right which runs through the melon symbol) He delivers the final blow.
      (Cut to who Aang stares at the drawing with slight disgust)
      Toph: Err… (Camera shifts to the right) what about me‌
      Sokka: (off screen) For now, you’re the Melon Lord’s forces.
      Toph: So I get to chuck flaming rocks at all of you‌
      Sokka: Whatever makes the training feel more realistic.
      Toph: Sweetness. (smiles)

      (Camera fades to reveal the Melon Lord with 2 sticks at arms opened up in
      a V-shape. Toph appears into screen in front of the scarecrow with the
      same pose.)

      Toph: Muahahahahahaha!

      (Cut to an overhead view of Toph’s area. She is surrounded by a ring of
      huge boulders covered with seaweed-like things. A ring of fire in bowls
      sits outside the boulders.

      Cut to Zuko and Katara who are hiding behind some rocks, looking at Toph.
      Zuko turns his head. Cut to Aang who appears out from behind another
      hiding spot with Momo in tow. He looks to the side. Cut to Suki and Sokka
      who peer out of their own hiding places. Sokka is wearing his Water Tribe
      wolf armor. Cut to the area where Toph is and the camera zooms out rapidly
      to reveal Sokka who signals with his arm to go.

      Cut to an overhead view of where the rest are hiding. Sokka, Suki, Zuko
      and Katara all make their way towards Toph except for Aang who stays put.

      Cut to Sokka and Suki who run before the ground shakes and pops up an army
      of Fire Nation soldiers made of rock charging at them. Cut to a side view
      of Sokka who cuts the rock in half. Suki jumps into camera as she spins
      and delivers a kick to another rock soldier, knocking it down. They
      continue to run before a flaming boulder drops into screen. Cut to a pair
      of hands touching the rock and the camera zooms out to reveal Suki cart
      wheeling over it. Cut to Sokka who is lying on the ground with his face
      mere inches away from being crushed.)

      Sokka: (shakes his fist) Watch it, Toph!
      Toph: (Cut back to Toph who is clearly enjoying herself) I am not Toph, I
      am “Melon Lord”! Muahahahahaha!

      (She earthbends a rock over the bowl of fire and it gets ignited
      immediately and she sends it towards Zuko and Katara who dodge it. Cut to
      an overhead view of Zuko and Katara running as a ring of rock soldiers
      surround them. Camera rotates around the duo as they fight back to back
      with fire and waterbending to destroy the rocks.)

      Sokka: (Cut back to Sokka who is running with his sword. Flaming rocks are
      being sent over his head continuously) Now, Aang!

      (Cut to Aang’s boot sole as he propels himself from the rock with his arms
      holding his staff in a ready to strike position. Cut to Aang’s serious
      face as he descends. Cut to the Melon Lord scarecrow from his point of
      view. Cut back to Aang as his face softens. Cut back to the scarecrow. Cut
      to a sideview of the scarecrow as Aang lands and brings his staff over his
      head but doesn’t deliver the final blow. The staff pauses inches away from
      the watermelon head. He looks at the scarecrow before slouching and
      pulling his staff back.)

      Zuko: (Cut to the group who are hiding behind a rock behind him) What are
      you waiting for‌ Take him out! (Camera slowly pans to Aang who looks
      unwillingly to perform the action)
      Aang: (shakes head) I can’t.

      (Cut to the sideview of the slope leading to the scarecrow. Sokka enters
      the screen and trudges up the slope. Cut to a closeup of Aang as Sokka
      walks up in front of him.)

      Sokka: What’s wrong with you‌ (points accusingly at Aang) If this was the
      real deal, (points at Aang again) you’d be shot full of lightning (he
      makes a beheading gesture against his neck) right now.
      Aang: I’m sorry, but it just didn’t feel right. I didn’t feel like myself.

      (Cut to Sokka who unsheathes his sword. Cut back to Aang as a slashing and
      squishing sound implies that Sokka cuts the watermelon off screen. He
      closes his eyes and grimaces at the act.)

      Sokka: (off screen) There. (Aang opens his eyes in shock) That’s how it’s
      done.

      (A piece of the watermelon falls off and hits the ground. Momo runs
      forward and begins to lick the insides.

      Camera zooms in on Aang who has a look of disbelief on his face. Scene
      changes to night time back at the courtyard. Cut to a plate of untouched
      food on Aang’s lap. Camera slowly pans up to reveal Aang looking down
      sadly while the rest of the group are heartily tucking in to their dinner.
      Katara walks in with a long scroll in her hands.)

      Katara: I have a surprise for everyone!

      Toph: (Cut to Toph holding her chopsticks in her bowl of rice) I knew it!
      You did have a secret thing with Haru!

      (She smiles while Katara gives an expressionless look in the background.
      Cut to Sokka, Suki and Zuko who are also equally expressionless.

      Camera zooms out to show the 3 of them staring at Katara while Toph is
      picking at her food.)

      Katara: Er, no. (All 4 of them suddenly start to shove rice into their
      mouths) I was looking for cooking pots in the attic and I found this.
      (Throws scroll downwards as it unrolls by itself.) Look at baby Zuko!
      (Camera zooms onto the scroll and reveals a baby smiling happily with his
      arms in the air, enjoying himself at the beach.) Isn’t he cute‌

      (Katara coos as everyone gushes and laughs. Cut back to Zuko with his eyes
      closed.)

      Katara: (off screen) Oh lighten up, I was just teasing.
      Zuko: (opens his eyes) That’s not me. It’s my Father. (Camera zooms out to
      show them again as Katara rapidly rolls the scroll)
      Suki: (points at the scroll and looks at Zuko) But he looked so sweet and
      innocent.
      Zuko: Well that sweet little kid grew up to be a monster. And the worst
      Father in the history of Fathers.
      Aang: But he is still a human being. (Everyone looks at him as the camera
      pans to Aang)
      Zuko: You’re going to defend him‌
      Aang: No, I agree with you. Fire Lord Ozai (stands up and faces the group)
      is a horrible person and the World will probably be better off without
      him. There’s gotta be another way.
      Zuko: (off screen) Like what‌
      Aang: (shrugs) I don’t know. Maybe (raises both arms as if he was holding
      a bowl) we can make some big pots of glue and then I can use gluebending
      to stick his arms and legs together so he can’t bend anymore.
      Zuko: (sarcastically) Yeah. Then you can show him his baby pictures and
      all those happy memories (everyone starts to laugh and snicker) will make
      him good again.
      Aang: (naively) Do you really think that would work‌
      Zuko: (seriously and sternly) No!
      Aang: (drops his head and sighs) This goes against (paces up and down,
      looking at his hands) everything I learned from the monks. I can’t just go
      around wiping out people I don’t like…
      Sokka: Sure, you can. You’re the Avatar. If it’s in the name of keeping
      balance, (Aang balls up his fist as he struggles to contain his temper)
      I’m pretty sure the Universe will forgive you.
      Aang: (Cut to Aang’s back as he rapidly turns around and bursts out) This
      isn’t a joke, Sokka! None of you understands the position I’m in!
      Katara: Aang, we do understand. It’s just…
      Aang: (rudely interrupts) Just what, Katara‌! What‌
      Katara: (Cut back to Katara who is visibly annoyed) We’re trying to help.
      Aang: (Cut back to Aang) Then when you (points at Katara) figure out a way
      for me (brings his hands back to his chest) to beat the Fire Lord without
      (makes a “no” gesture with his arm) taking his life, I love to hear it!
      (Raises his arms in exasperation and walks away.)
      Katara: Aang, don’t walk away from this. (She begins to walk towards him
      as a hand touches her shoulder to stop her from doing so.)
      Zuko: Let him go. He needs time to sort it out by himself.

      (Cut to an overhead view of the trees surrounding the house and the
      balcony Aang is sitting on. There is a table of fire in front of him. Cut
      to an area behind Aang’s shoulder to reveal 4 candles and some offerings
      consisting of bread, water and fruit on a tray. Cut to an area behind the
      candles as the camera slowly pans up to reveal Aang in the lotus position.
      Cut to Aang’s head and the camera slowly zooms up. Cut to Aang’s sideview
      as Momo glides in and tries to get Aang’s attention by touching his lap.)

      Aang: Hey, Momo. (pats Momo’s head) I don’t suppose you know what I should
      do. (Cut to Momo who makes a sound) I didn’t think so.

      (Momo lies on its side while Aang returns back to meditating. Camera fades
      to some moments later to reveal that Aang is fast asleep, lying on his
      side near Momo. The candles are already extinguished. Cut to the ocean in
      front of the house and camera zooms out in a rapid motion. Cut again to an
      area with trees on the ocean, still facing the house. Aang suddenly opens
      his eyes and sits up.

      Chanting starts to play continuously in the background. Camera slowly pans
      up from the balcony to reveal a forested area at the edge of the shore.
      Aang stands up, walks over the tray and climbs over the balcony railing.
      Momo is awakened and looks at his master. He jumps to the railing before
      flying off. Cut to a sideview of Aang who walks briskly on the path to the
      ocean as Momo circles around him in the air. Cut to a close up of Aang who
      appears to be sleepwalking. Cut to a path of footprints on the beach. The
      camera pans up to reveal Aang and Momo reaching the edge of the shore. Cut
      to Aang walking into the water and starts to swim. Cut to Momo who is
      still on the beach, watching his master swim out to sea, towards the
      forested area. Momo begins to fly after him. The chanting ends.

      Cut to commercial break.)

      Act III

      (Scene opens up to the sea the next morning. Camera pans down to the
      courtyard where everyone is gathered around Appa.)

      Sokka: Okay, that’s everything.

      Toph: (Cut to Toph’s back view. She is sitting on some stone steps) No,
      it’s not. (Everyone turns to face her) Where’s Aang‌ (Cut back to the rest
      who look surprised and run off to look for him. Cut to Appa who eats his
      hay nonchalantly.)
      Zuko: (Cut back to inside the house. Everyone runs up the steps to the
      corridor and looks around.) Aang‌ Aang!
      Toph: Come on lazy bones, let’s go.

      (Suki, Sokka &amp; Katara head to the right of the corridor while Toph &amp; Zuko
      head in the opposite direction. Cut to the inside of a dark room as the
      door is suddenly thrown open to reveal Zuko. He walks out of the room and
      meets Toph who does a “nothing” gesture with her hands. They walk off. Cut
      to the railing of the balcony. Aang’s staff is lying on it. Sokka walks
      onto the balcony, scratching his head. He sees the staff and looks
      surprised as the camera zooms out and Suki &amp; Katara walk in.)

      Sokka: (his gloved hand grabs the staff) He left his staff. That’s so
      strange.
      Zuko: Aang’s not in the house. Let’s check the beach. (He turns his head
      towards the beach and the camera zooms in onto the ocean. Cut to a broken
      docking area on the edge of the sea as 2 seagulls fly pass. The remaining
      of the Gaang can be seen near the shore as black shadows. )
      Sokka: Look! There’s his footprints. (Camera pans up to the path of
      footprints leading to the sea.) The trail ends here.
      Suki: So… He went for a midnight swim and never came back‌
      Katara: Maybe he was captured.
      Sokka: I don’t think so. There’s no sign of a struggle.
      Toph: (bends down) I bet he ran away again.
      Sokka: Ah-uh. He left behind his glider and Appa.
      Toph: Then what do you think happened to him oh sloozey one‌
      Sokka: It’s pretty obvious. (stands up and throws his hands to the side)
      Aang mysteriously disappears before an important battle‌ He’s definitely
      on a Spirit World journey. (His finger points up in an “I got it!”
      position)
      Zuko: But if he was, wouldn’t his body still be here‌
      Sokka: (slumps) Oh yeah, forgot about that.
      Katara: Then he’s gotta be somewhere on Ember Island. Let’s split up and
      look for him.
      Toph: (grabs Zuko’s arm swiftly and he blushes) I’m going with Zuko!
      (Camera pans out to show the rest looking at her curiously) What‌ Everyone
      else went on a life changing fieldtrip with Zuko. Now it’s my turn. (She
      hugs him tighter and Zuko is still blushing)

      (Cut to the camera being somewhere on the sea. Appa flies out from behind
      a cliff. Cut to Sokka on Appa’s head, looking around with a serious look
      on his face. Cut to the bustling town area of Ember Island. There’s a
      crowd surrounding someone in an air nomad outfit and they cheer for “Aang”
      repeatedly. Camera slowly zooms in on Suki &amp; Katara who are shocked to
      hear his name. They quickly run to the crowd and breaks a section apart.)

      Caricature Aang: (The tattooed head turns around) Avatar State, yip yip!
      (Caricature Toph lifts her up in the air as she poses in a flying position
      as the crowd cheers wildly. Cut back to Suki &amp; Katara who have an
      exaggerated anime look of anger and “WHAT‌!” on their faces.)
      Toph: (Cut to some beach houses and camera pans down to Toph in her Fire
      Nation outfit &amp; Zuko walking around) And then when I was nine, I ran away
      again.
      Zuko: Uh-huh.
      Toph: I know I shouldn’t complain, (Closes her eyes and opens her hands to
      the side. Zuko appears disinterested and looks away.) my parents gave me
      everything that I ever asked for. But they never gave me the one thing
      that I really wanted. Their love. You know what I mean‌ (Zuko drops his
      head and sighs audibly)
      Zuko: (Cut back to Zuko who turns around and looks at her) Look, I know
      you had a rough childhood but we should really focus on finding Aang. (Cut
      to the top view of the scene with 2 white birds feeding on a branch. Zuko
      walks on.)
      Toph: (Cut back to Toph who looks disappointed) This is the worst
      fieldtrip ever.

      (She blows her fringe in irritation. Cut back to the roof of Ozai’s beach
      house as the camera pans down to the group sitting on the steps
      despondently. Toph &amp; Katara are back in their respective nation’s outfits.
      Appa lands onto screen and growls.)

      Sokka: Judging by the looks on your faces, I’m guessing you guys didn’t
      find Aang either. (Cut back to the steps as Sokka jumps and lands in front
      of them)
      Zuko: No. It’s like he just… disappeared.
      Toph: (sits up) Hey, wait a minute, has anyone noticed that Momo’s missing
      too‌
      Sokka: (turns around in horror) Oh no! (kneels down and camera cuts to the
      top view of Sokka who is behaving hysterically) I knew it was only a
      matter of time. Appa ate Momo! (Cut to Appa as Sokka jumps in and lifts
      Appa’s jaws to peer into his mouth) Momo, (Cut to the inside of the mouth
      with the camera looking at Sokka) I’m coming for ya, buddy! (Sokka climbs
      onto Appa’s tongue and tries to crawl his way in.)
      Katara: (Cut back to Katara who staring calmly at her brother) Sokka, Appa
      didn’t eat Momo. He’s probably with Aang.
      Sokka: (Cut to outside Appa’s mouth as he turns around and looks at his
      sister) That’s just what Appa wants you to think. (He climbs further in
      and Appa closes his mouth around Sokka’s legs as they flail around.)
      Zuko: (off screen) Get out of the bison’s mouth, Sokka. (Cut back to Zuko
      who is not looking very pleased) We have a real problem here. Aang is
      nowhere to be found and the comet is only 2 days away.
      Katara: (Cut to the girls who are looking up at him) What should we do
      Zuko‌ (In the background, Sokka slides out of Appa’s mouth and his entire
      body is covered in Appa’s saliva.)
      Zuko: (stands up) I don’t know. (Cut to the rest who continue to stare at
      him) Why are you all looking at me‌ (Cut back to Zuko who looks around)
      Katara: (Cut back to the rest) Well, you are kind of the expert on
      tracking Aang.
      Toph: (In the background, Sokka is seen standing up and trying to rub off
      the spit.) Yeah, if anyone’s got experience hunting the Avatar, (Sokka
      takes a step and slips as he hits the ground with a very loud groan) it’s
      you. (Cut back to Zuko’s scarred side as he looks down. Cut to the ocean
      near dusk as Appa flies swiftly towards some dark clouds. Cut to the front
      of Zuko who is on Appa’s head while the rest watch him from the saddle.)
      Sokka: Zuko, I don’t want to tell you how to do your job but why are we
      heading towards the Earth Kingdom‌ There’s no way Aang’s there.
      Zuko: (Cut to Zuko’s unscarred side as his eye is shown looking back at
      Sokka) Just trust me.

      (Cut to Appa who picks up the pace and soars into the horizon and growls.

      Cut to an overhead view of the royal plaza in the Fire Nation. There’s a
      ship docked near the port and some contigents are seen on both sides of
      the red carpet. Cut to a group of Fire Nation citizens bowing down to a
      palanquin passing by with a silhouette of a person inside. Cut to a close
      up to Ozai’s face to reveal that he is the one currently in the palanquin.
      Cut to an overhead shot of the red carpet as Ozai’s palanquin proceeds
      forward.

      Camera pans up to reveal another palanquin a fair distance behind. Cut to
      the inside of that palanquin to reveal Azula sitting crossed legged and
      looking rather impatient as her eyes darts to the side. Cut to outside the
      palanquin as Azula throws the veil open.)

      Azula: Come on slowpokes, faster!

      (The palanquin bearers pick up the pace but they are visibly struggling
      with the weight. Cut back to Azula who is still not looking very pleased.
      Cut to an overhead view of the plaza as the palanquin is seen travelling
      to the port at a very fast speed. Cut to Ozai’s palanquin as a servant
      holds the veil aside. Cut to Ozai’s red and gold boot stepping out. Camera
      zooms out to reveal a crownless Ozai walking past a line of elite
      firebenders. Cut to the front of Ozai as he walks up the steps, leaving
      the plaza behind him. Azula comes into screen behind him and kneels down.)

      Azula: Sorry I’m late, Father. Good palanquin bearers (Her eyes look to
      the side menancingly) are so hard to come by these days. So, is everything
      ready for our departure‌ (turns her head to the side leisurely)
      Fire Lord Ozai: (off screen) There has been a change of plans, Azula.
      Azula: (She turns her head back and her eyes widen in shock) What‌
      Fire Lord Ozai: (Cut to Ozai’s back) I’ve decided to lead the fleet of
      airships to Ba Sing Se alone. (Cut to Azula who is still looking shocked.)
      You will remain here in the Fire Nation.
      Azula: (whines and begins to behave like a spoilt child) But I thought we
      were going to do this together.
      Fire Lord Ozai: (Cut back to Ozai’s back again) My decision is final.
      Azula: (Cut back to Azula who looks very unhappy) You… (Stands up and
      talks back to her Father) you can’t treat me like this. (Her face
      scrunches up into anger and annoyance) You can’t treat me like Zuko!
      (Throws her head forward to make her point)
      Fire Lord Ozai: (Cut to Ozai’s side view) Azula, silence yourself. (He
      frowns slightly)
      Azula: (Cut back to Azula who whines even more) But it was my idea
      (clenches her fist towards herself) to burn everything to the ground! I
      deserve to be by your side!
      Fire Lord Ozai: (Turns his head back fiercely and raises his voice
      sharply) Azula! (Azula stills her temper, closes her eyes and lowers her
      head in obedience) Listen to me. (Cut to an overhead view of where they
      are standing on. They are standing on a giant red and gold phoenix motif
      on the ground surrounded by a handful of fire sages and some elite
      firebenders. There’s a set of armor on a small platform in front of them.)
      I need you here to watch over the homeland, it’s a very important job (Cut
      back to Azula who opens her eyes) that I can only entrust to you.
      Azula: (looks up in disbelief) Really‌
      Fire Lord Ozai: And for your loyalty, (turns to face his daughter) I’ve
      decided to declare you the new Fire Lord.
      Azula: (Cut to a close up of her face) Fire Lord Azula‌ (Her face suddenly
      looks happy and turns her head to the side) It does seem appropriate. But,
      (turns her head back) what about you‌
      Fire Lord Ozai: (Cut to Ozai’s face) Fire Lord Ozai is no more. Just as
      the World will be reborn in fire, (Camera zooms out as the fire sages put
      on golden phoenix shoulder pad armor on him) I shall be reborn (a phoenix
      helmet is placed on his head) as the supreme ruler of the World. (Cut to a
      side view of Ozai) From this moment on, I will be known as… (raises his
      arms proudly) the “Phoenix King”!

      (A large, maroon phoenix motif banner is raised behind him. Cut to the
      line of firebenders holding the normal, red Fire Lord banners as another
      group of firebenders in front of them bring up the new, maroon Phoenix
      King banners. Cut to the other side as they do the same. Cut to 2
      firebenders poised beside a giant urn at the bottom of a pillar. Camera
      zooms in on the urn as they firebend into 2 openings at the side of the
      urn. Camera pans up the pillar as fire lights up at the top. Cut to the
      citizens as they bow down. The pillars on each side of the banner light up
      to resemble a pair of phoenix wings. Cut back to Ozai in his full phoenix
      armor as the camera slowly zooms out to show the banner and the fire
      pillars.

      Cut to a 3 storey building in the middle of a forested area. A group of
      people can be seen walking towards the door. Cut to the inside of the
      noisy building as dancing music from “The Headband” plays. Some patrons
      are gasping in shock and staring at something. Camera pans to the side as
      the door opens to reveal Zuko and the rest of the group)

      Katara: (observing warily) And the reason you brought us to a seedy Earth
      Kingdom tavern is what now‌
      Zuko: June.

      (Raises his arm and points. Cut to June sitting dismissively and sipping
      her tea as a huge burly man lunges as her. She stops him with her leg and
      pushes him down effortlessly as the man groans. The crowd gasps and are
      stunned. June smiles at her success.)

      Sokka: (off screen) Oh yeah (Cut to a close up of June’s eye) that weird
      bounty hunter with the giant mole.
      Suki: (off screen) Mole‌ Her skin is flawless.

      (Camera zooms out to show June quickly getting off her seat as another
      opponent dressed like Ryu from Street Fighter crashes into her bench,
      breaking it into pieces. The previous opponent quickly scrambles away as
      “Ryu” takes another shot.)

      Sokka: (off screen) No, (June deftly dodges and spins away with her tea
      cup still in hand. “Ryu” continues to fight) she has this giant mole
      creature she rides around on.
      Zuko: (Cut back to the group standing at the doorway) Her shirshu. (groans
      can be heard from the fight) It’s the only animal that can track Aang’s
      scent anywhere in the World. It’s the one shot we have of finding him.

      (Cut back to the fight as “Ryu” tries to throw punches at June. It
      narrowly misses her tea cup as she throws it up into the air and time
      slows down and the tea cup rotates slowly. Cut back to an angry and
      annoyed June and time resumes back to normal as she throws “Ryu” over her
      shoulder when he lunges at her. Cut to a table at a corner of the tavern
      as the patrons widen their eyes and scramble away. “Ryu” lands on the
      table a second later, knocking off all the dishes on the table. Cut back
      to June as she grabs her falling tea cup without spilling any of its
      contents and the music ends. She turns away and drinks her tea.)

      Toph: (Cut back to the group at the doorway) I don’t know who this June
      lady is but (crosses her arms and smiles widely) I like her.

      (Camera changes scene to Aang’s sleeping form in the forested area and the
      camera zooms in on his body. Cut to Aang’s face as Momo’s licks it. He
      stirs and begins to wake up.)

      Aang: (groans from sleepiness) Hey Momo, (sits up and rubs his head. Momo
      is clutching Aang’s head protectively as it looks around) I just had the
      strangest dream. (He opens his eyes with a surprised look on his face and
      surveys his surroundings. He turns his head towards the ocean) Wait…

      (Camera suddenly zooms in on the ocean and mysterious, eerie, chanting
      music plays. Cut back to Aang &amp; Momo as the camera rotates slightly around
      them. Cut to an area in the water looking at the forested area and zooms
      out. Scene fades to the vast ocean with the forested area appearing to be
      in the middle of no where)

      Aang: (off screen) Where are we‌

      (The music speeds up a little and ends abruptly. Fade to white.)

第十八回
苏进的彗星，第一部分
凤凰大帝

45
00:02:57,914 --&gt; 00:02:59,754
出招再猛一点

46
00:02:59,754 --&gt; 00:03:02,671
想象着用那拳击穿你对手的心脏！

47
00:03:03,794 --&gt; 00:03:05,457
啊，我正在努力呢

48
00:03:05,457 --&gt; 00:03:08,070
像虎犰狳一样喊出声音来！

49
00:03:10,721 --&gt; 00:03:12,031
你的发出的声音太可悲了

50
00:03:12,031 --&gt; 00:03:14,141
给我咆哮起来！

51
00:03:21,220 --&gt; 00:03:25,016
清凉可口的西瓜汁谁要喝啊？

52
00:03:25,016 --&gt; 00:03:27,003
哦，哦！我，我，我要！

53
00:03:27,003 --&gt; 00:03:28,829
嘿，你今天的训练还没完事呢

54
00:03:28,829 --&gt; 00:03:30,126
给我回来！

55
00:03:30,126 --&gt; 00:03:34,050
算了，祖寇，就让他休息一下吧，没什么大不了的

56
00:03:34,050 --&gt; 00:03:35,297
好吧

57
00:03:36,728 --&gt; 00:03:40,697
如果你们想像群臭烘烘的树懒
一样围在那儿，那就随你们的便好了

58
00:03:40,697 --&gt; 00:03:42,514
也许祖寇是对的

59
00:03:42,514 --&gt; 00:03:45,331
就这样坐在房子周围，显得咱们像无所事事似的

60
00:03:45,331 --&gt; 00:03:47,723
我知道有种方法能够改变咱们懒惰的形象

61
00:03:47,723 --&gt; 00:03:48,882
海滩派对！

62
00:04:09,450 --&gt; 00:04:11,176
沙雕版的阿柏大功告成

63
00:04:12,200 --&gt; 00:04:13,703
手艺不错嘛

64
00:04:14,643 --&gt; 00:04:17,016
我一直都在演练我的御砂术

65
00:04:17,016 --&gt; 00:04:18,766
这个你一定会喜欢的

66
00:04:25,217 --&gt; 00:04:29,101
哇哦，你居然还做了微缩版的土强王和巴斯科

67
00:04:30,600 --&gt; 00:04:32,756
索卡，看你能不能比我做的更好

68
00:04:36,160 --&gt; 00:04:39,631
那是一个哭泣的龙头妖兽吗？

69
00:04:39,631 --&gt; 00:04:41,274
才不是，这是苏琪

70
00:04:44,262 --&gt; 00:04:48,387
苏琪，如果你因为这个跟他分手，我举双手赞成

71
00:04:48,387 --&gt; 00:04:50,025
我真的很喜欢

72
00:04:51,000 --&gt; 00:04:53,064
这个雕塑哪点像...

73
00:05:06,759 --&gt; 00:05:08,848
你这是要干嘛？

74
00:05:10,118 --&gt; 00:05:11,612
给你点教训

75
00:05:26,964 --&gt; 00:05:28,152
怎么了？

76
00:05:28,152 --&gt; 00:05:29,726
祖寇他疯了

77
00:05:29,726 --&gt; 00:05:33,180
我刚做了个沙雕版的苏琪，居然被他给弄坏了

78
00:05:34,120 --&gt; 00:05:36,120
哦，他还攻击安昂

79
00:05:55,108 --&gt; 00:05:57,761
别惹我，否则我就把你从屋顶轰下去！

80
00:05:57,761 --&gt; 00:05:59,226
来吧，动手啊

81
00:06:31,877 --&gt; 00:06:33,531
够了！

82
00:06:42,822 --&gt; 00:06:45,797
你到底想干嘛？你可能会伤到安昂的

83
00:06:45,797 --&gt; 00:06:48,743
我有什么问题？我还想问问你们呢！

84
00:06:48,743 --&gt; 00:06:52,959
彗星三天后就到来了，你们居然还在那儿吃喝玩乐

85
00:06:55,595 --&gt; 00:06:57,370
你们干嘛那样看着我，好像我是个疯子似的

86
00:06:57,370 --&gt; 00:06:59,836
关于苏进的彗星

87
00:06:59,836 --&gt; 00:07:03,339
我打算在它到来之后再去与烈火王决一死战

88
00:07:03,339 --&gt; 00:07:04,387
之后？

89
00:07:04,387 --&gt; 00:07:08,055
我还没准备好，需要更多的时间来练习御火术

90
00:07:08,055 --&gt; 00:07:11,387
说实话，你的御土术也欠点火候

91
00:07:11,387 --&gt; 00:07:14,490
这么说你们都知道安昂的想法喽？

92
00:07:14,490 --&gt; 00:07:18,499
说实话，如果现在安昂与烈火王对战的话，他会输的

93
00:07:18,879 --&gt; 00:07:20,023
所以，还是先别打了

94
00:07:20,023 --&gt; 00:07:22,744
在彗星到来之前与烈火王决斗

95
00:07:22,744 --&gt; 00:07:25,069
是为了阻止火宗取得战争的胜利

96
00:07:25,069 --&gt; 00:07:27,945
但是他们在占领永固城时就已经奠定了胜局

97
00:07:27,945 --&gt; 00:07:29,967
事情不会变得更糟了吧

98
00:07:29,967 --&gt; 00:07:31,424
你们错了

99
00:07:32,582 --&gt; 00:07:35,187
不只会变糟，而且会糟到你们无法想象...

100
00:07:35,187 --&gt; 00:07:40,246
在日食日之前，父皇让我参加一个重要的作战会议

101
00:07:40,246 --&gt; 00:07:43,466
这一刻是我这些年来一直梦寐以求的

102
00:07:43,466 --&gt; 00:07:47,021
父皇终于接纳了我

103
00:07:49,209 --&gt; 00:07:51,615
欢迎你，祖寇王子

104
00:07:51,615 --&gt; 00:07:53,586
我们已经等候多时了

105
00:08:00,361 --&gt; 00:08:03,518
使弩将军，开始报告吧

106
00:08:03,518 --&gt; 00:08:04,796
是的，陛下

107
00:08:05,504 --&gt; 00:08:08,468
永固城仍在我们的掌控之下

108
00:08:08,468 --&gt; 00:08:14,593
不过，土宗的暴乱仍时有发生
使得我们还未取得土强国的全部控制

109
00:08:14,593 --&gt; 00:08:16,382
你有什么建议吗？

110
00:08:16,382 --&gt; 00:08:21,431
我们派出的兵力还远远不够，等日食过去、入侵被阻止后

111
00:08:21,431 --&gt; 00:08:25,246
我们应该派更多的兵力进驻土强国

112
00:08:26,663 --&gt; 00:08:30,698
祖寇，你曾经深入土强国的内部

113
00:08:30,698 --&gt; 00:08:34,200
你认为增加兵力可以阻止暴乱的发生吗？

114
00:08:36,099 --&gt; 00:08:39,309
土强国的子民骄傲而强壮

115
00:08:39,309 --&gt; 00:08:42,938
只要他们心怀希望就会忍耐下去

116
00:08:42,938 --&gt; 00:08:45,369
是啊，你说的没错

117
00:08:46,240 --&gt; 00:08:49,446
我们得毁了他们的希望

118
00:08:49,446 --&gt; 00:08:52,047
那个，我并不是那个...

119
00:08:52,047 --&gt; 00:08:54,455
我认为您应该夺走他们宝贵的希望

120
00:08:54,455 --&gt; 00:08:57,611
把他们剩余的土地都夷为平地

121
00:08:58,631 --&gt; 00:09:01,791
是啊，是啊，你说的没错，阿祖拉

122
00:09:01,791 --&gt; 00:09:05,528
苏进的彗星即将到来

123
00:09:05,528 --&gt; 00:09:10,736
那一天，彗星所聚集的能量可以与数百的太阳相匹敌

124
00:09:10,848 --&gt; 00:09:13,401
任何御术师都不会是我们的对手

125
00:09:13,401 --&gt; 00:09:15,849
陛下，你的意思是？

126
00:09:15,915 --&gt; 00:09:22,591
上次彗星来临之时，我的曾祖父
烈火王苏进利用它肃清了气宗部落

127
00:09:22,591 --&gt; 00:09:28,025
如今，我要利用彗星的力量彻底的铲除土强国

128
00:09:29,253 --&gt; 00:09:33,284
我们从气艇中向地面发动烈焰攻击

129
00:09:33,284 --&gt; 00:09:36,399
大火会烧损万物

130
00:09:36,399 --&gt; 00:09:40,597
新的世界将从灰烬中重生

131
00:09:40,597 --&gt; 00:09:47,644
天下疆土将纳入烈火国的版图，我将成为世界的主宰

132
00:09:49,500 --&gt; 00:09:52,455
我想说这是一个多么恐怖的计划

133
00:09:52,455 --&gt; 00:09:54,542
不过遗憾的是我并没有那种勇气

134
00:09:55,314 --&gt; 00:09:58,804
我的一生都在争取我父皇的爱与信任

135
00:09:58,804 --&gt; 00:10:03,434
可当一切成真之后，才发现我已失去了当初的斗志

136
00:10:03,434 --&gt; 00:10:05,570
失去了自我

137
00:10:06,305 --&gt; 00:10:08,069
这怎么可能

138
00:10:08,339 --&gt; 00:10:11,059
虽然我一直认为烈火王是个大坏蛋

139
00:10:11,059 --&gt; 00:10:13,713
但是我没想到他的计划居然如此邪恶

140
00:10:14,444 --&gt; 00:10:16,209
我该怎么做呢？

141
00:10:16,209 --&gt; 00:10:17,898
我知道你很害怕

142
00:10:17,898 --&gt; 00:10:20,533
我知道你还没有准备好拯救世界

143
00:10:20,533 --&gt; 00:10:24,504
但是如果你不在彗星到来之前战败烈火王

144
00:10:24,504 --&gt; 00:10:26,832
这个世界也就将不复存在了

145
00:10:29,615 --&gt; 00:10:33,020
你为啥不早告诉我你父皇的那个疯狂计划？

146
00:10:33,020 --&gt; 00:10:34,527
我原以为没这个必要

147
00:10:34,527 --&gt; 00:10:37,241
我想你反正都要在彗星到来之前结束烈火王

148
00:10:37,241 --&gt; 00:10:38,844
没人告诉我你打算推迟决战

149
00:10:38,844 --&gt; 00:10:43,382
真糟啊，这真是真是太糟了

150
00:10:43,382 --&gt; 00:10:46,639
安昂，你不用一个人去面对

151
00:10:46,639 --&gt; 00:10:51,160
是啊，只要我们齐心合力，烈火王肯定输定了

152
00:10:51,160 --&gt; 00:10:54,026
太好了，神通帮又回来了

153
00:10:54,026 --&gt; 00:10:55,101
气

154
00:10:55,101 --&gt; 00:10:56,090
水

155
00:10:56,090 --&gt; 00:10:57,140
土

156
00:10:57,140 --&gt; 00:10:58,065
火

157
00:10:58,065 --&gt; 00:11:00,190
扇女与剑客

158
00:11:01,198 --&gt; 00:11:05,321
与烈火王对战将是我们所做过的最困难的事情

159
00:11:05,321 --&gt; 00:11:08,159
不过我不会临阵退缩的！

160
00:11:10,358 --&gt; 00:11:11,999
-耶   -太好了

161
00:11:11,999 --&gt; 00:11:13,176
祖寇，过来啊

162
00:11:13,176 --&gt; 00:11:14,861
既然你已经是我们的一员

163
00:11:14,876 --&gt; 00:11:16,925
团队拥抱你怎么可以不参加呢？

164
00:11:25,644 --&gt; 00:11:28,708
在与父皇对战之前，还有一招绝学需要传授与你

165
00:11:29,571 --&gt; 00:11:31,017
那就是“闪电易向”

166
00:11:32,782 --&gt; 00:11:36,830
让闪电跟随你体内的能量流动，并顺势发出

167
00:11:36,830 --&gt; 00:11:39,118
你就可以以其人之道还施彼身

168
00:11:39,118 --&gt; 00:11:40,799
就像御水术一样对吧

169
00:11:40,799 --&gt; 00:11:41,676
没错

170
00:11:41,676 --&gt; 00:11:45,246
皇叔就是通过研习御水师的动作，发明了这门技艺

171
00:11:45,246 --&gt; 00:11:48,916
你之前曾经使用过这招吗？

172
00:11:48,916 --&gt; 00:11:49,905
用过一次,

173
00:11:49,905 --&gt; 00:11:51,424
是在对抗我父王的时候

174
00:11:51,424 --&gt; 00:11:52,500
那是一种什么样的感觉？

175
00:11:53,489 --&gt; 00:11:58,921
很强很恐怖

176
00:12:01,515 --&gt; 00:12:05,021
接住闪电时，你会感觉体内的力量如此强大

177
00:12:05,021 --&gt; 00:12:08,712
不过少有差池，你就会命丧黄泉

178
00:12:08,712 --&gt; 00:12:11,749
我不会真的挂掉吧

179
00:12:11,767 --&gt; 00:12:16,325
卡塔拉还有灵洲之水可助我还魂的，不是吗？

180
00:12:16,325 --&gt; 00:12:19,757
事实上，那瓶灵水在上次阿祖拉袭击你之后就用光了

181
00:12:20,614 --&gt; 00:12:25,016
你必须在烈火王杀死你之前取得他的性命

182
00:12:26,000 --&gt; 00:12:28,860
好吧，我会照做的

183
00:12:34,875 --&gt; 00:12:36,796
神通帮，集合了啊！

184
00:12:39,166 --&gt; 00:12:42,895
若要除掉烈火王，也就是本次演习中的西瓜王

185
00:12:42,895 --&gt; 00:12:44,946
我们必须掌握好时机

186
00:12:44,946 --&gt; 00:12:47,748
首先，苏琪和我会吸引他的火力

187
00:12:47,748 --&gt; 00:12:51,325
然后，卡塔拉和祖寇搭档进行灵活的强攻

188
00:12:51,325 --&gt; 00:12:55,670
趁西瓜王分心之时，安昂出其不意的出现

189
00:12:55,670 --&gt; 00:12:57,523
给他致命的一击

190
00:12:57,523 --&gt; 00:12:59,602
呃，那我该做些什么呢?

191
00:12:59,602 --&gt; 00:13:01,627
从现在开始，你就是西瓜王的左膀右臂

192
00:13:01,627 --&gt; 00:13:04,393
这么说我可以随便向你们扔石头喽？

193
00:13:04,393 --&gt; 00:13:06,602
你全力攻击吧，越接近实战越好

194
00:13:06,602 --&gt; 00:13:08,484
我喜欢

195
00:13:38,414 --&gt; 00:13:40,180
拓芙，你看着点啊

196
00:13:40,180 --&gt; 00:13:43,916
我不是拓芙，我是西瓜王

197
00:13:59,382 --&gt; 00:14:01,241
安昂，趁现在

198
00:14:11,665 --&gt; 00:14:13,225
你还犹豫什么呢？

199
00:14:13,225 --&gt; 00:14:14,422
干掉他

200
00:14:14,422 --&gt; 00:14:15,522
我下不了手

201
00:14:18,000 --&gt; 00:14:19,586
你到底是咋回事啊？

202
00:14:19,586 --&gt; 00:14:23,010
如果这是真实对决的话，你早就小命不保了

203
00:14:23,010 --&gt; 00:14:25,861
对不起，不过我觉得这么做不对

204
00:14:25,861 --&gt; 00:14:27,874
这不是我的作风

205
00:14:31,723 --&gt; 00:14:33,893
看到没，就应该这样手起刀落

206
00:14:46,819 --&gt; 00:14:49,028
我给大家带来了个惊喜

207
00:14:49,028 --&gt; 00:14:52,397
我就知道，你肯定和哈鲁之间有猫腻

208
00:14:54,825 --&gt; 00:15:00,600
呃，没有啦，我在阁楼找蒸罐时发现了这个

209
00:15:01,602 --&gt; 00:15:04,737
看婴儿时的祖寇，多可爱啊

210
00:15:07,377 --&gt; 00:15:09,954
看到这幅画让我心情好多了

211
00:15:09,974 --&gt; 00:15:13,296
那可不是我，是我的父皇

212
00:15:14,610 --&gt; 00:15:17,235
可是他看上去多么的可爱无邪啊

213
00:15:17,235 --&gt; 00:15:19,667
那个天真无邪的婴儿现在已长成了一个大魔头

214
00:15:19,667 --&gt; 00:15:22,384
他还是世界上最差的父亲之一

215
00:15:22,384 --&gt; 00:15:24,284
但是他仍然是个人

216
00:15:25,106 --&gt; 00:15:26,481
你是要为他辩护吗？

217
00:15:26,481 --&gt; 00:15:28,449
不，你说的我都同意

218
00:15:28,449 --&gt; 00:15:30,643
烈火王是个可怕的人

219
00:15:30,710 --&gt; 00:15:33,303
没有他将会天下太平

220
00:15:33,303 --&gt; 00:15:34,959
不过肯定会有其他的解决办法的

221
00:15:34,959 --&gt; 00:15:35,987
什么办法？

222
00:15:35,987 --&gt; 00:15:37,382
我还不知道

223
00:15:37,382 --&gt; 00:15:40,365
也许我们能作出一种强力胶水

224
00:15:40,365 --&gt; 00:15:42,790
然后我用御胶术粘住他的手脚

225
00:15:42,805 --&gt; 00:15:44,377
这样他就再也用不出御术了

226
00:15:44,471 --&gt; 00:15:46,781
是啊，然后给他看儿时的画像

227
00:15:46,781 --&gt; 00:15:48,850
让他回忆美好时光，他就会弃恶从善啦

228
00:15:48,904 --&gt; 00:15:50,247
这样真的可以吗？

229
00:15:50,247 --&gt; 00:15:51,526
才怪

230
00:15:54,059 --&gt; 00:15:57,030
现在要做的完全与长老们教我的背道而驰

231
00:15:57,030 --&gt; 00:16:00,277
我不能不喜欢谁就把他咔嚓掉

232
00:16:00,277 --&gt; 00:16:02,286
你当然能了，你可是神通啊

233
00:16:02,286 --&gt; 00:16:04,232
这可是替天行道

234
00:16:04,232 --&gt; 00:16:06,410
上苍肯定会原谅你的

235
00:16:06,636 --&gt; 00:16:08,815
索卡，这可不是什么玩笑

236
00:16:08,815 --&gt; 00:16:11,342
没人能理解我的处境

237
00:16:11,342 --&gt; 00:16:13,169
安昂，我们都了解，只是...

238
00:16:13,169 --&gt; 00:16:14,931
只是什么，卡塔拉？

239
00:16:14,931 --&gt; 00:16:16,757
-咋啦？ -大家只是想帮你

240
00:16:16,757 --&gt; 00:16:20,453
如果你们能想出不用取人性命也能救助天下的方法

241
00:16:20,453 --&gt; 00:16:22,164
我会洗耳恭听的

242
00:16:23,380 --&gt; 00:16:25,931
安昂，咱们还没谈完呢

243
00:16:27,341 --&gt; 00:16:28,609
让他走吧

244
00:16:29,510 --&gt; 00:16:33,038
给他点时间，他会自己想明白的

245
00:16:48,499 --&gt; 00:16:50,644
嘿，模模

246
00:16:50,644 --&gt; 00:16:53,136
你肯定不知道我该怎么做，对吧

247
00:16:54,613 --&gt; 00:16:56,114
你怎么会知道呢

248
00:17:53,493 --&gt; 00:17:55,127
好了，东西都齐了

249
00:17:55,127 --&gt; 00:17:57,857
不对，还没齐，安昂在哪儿？

250
00:18:02,000 --&gt; 00:18:04,726
安昂，安昂？

251
00:18:04,726 --&gt; 00:18:07,132
该走了，大懒虫

252
00:18:20,037 --&gt; 00:18:22,203
他的滑翼还在这儿

253
00:18:22,203 --&gt; 00:18:23,738
真奇怪

254
00:18:23,738 --&gt; 00:18:26,111
屋里找不到他，咱们就去海滩看看吧

255
00:18:28,864 --&gt; 00:18:31,320
快看，这里有一行脚印

256
00:18:31,320 --&gt; 00:18:33,092
到这儿就没有了

257
00:18:33,092 --&gt; 00:18:36,933
这么说他半夜去游泳，之后就一去不回了？

258
00:18:37,151 --&gt; 00:18:38,477
莫非他被抓走了

259
00:18:38,477 --&gt; 00:18:41,143
不应该，这里没有挣扎打斗的痕迹

260
00:18:41,143 --&gt; 00:18:42,819
他肯定又临阵脱逃了

261
00:18:42,819 --&gt; 00:18:45,669
不能，他连滑翼和阿柏都没带走

262
00:18:45,669 --&gt; 00:18:48,716
那你说他去哪儿了，聪明蛋

263
00:18:48,815 --&gt; 00:18:53,937
安昂在大战前神秘消失，这不是很明显吗

264
00:18:53,937 --&gt; 00:18:56,407
他肯定是去灵界了

265
00:18:56,407 --&gt; 00:18:59,257
如果是那样的话，他的肉身应该还在啊？

266
00:18:59,257 --&gt; 00:19:01,222
哎呀，我忘了这点了

267
00:19:01,222 --&gt; 00:19:03,342
那他应该还在余烬岛上

268
00:19:03,385 --&gt; 00:19:04,706
咱们分头去找

269
00:19:04,706 --&gt; 00:19:06,485
我要跟祖寇一队

270
00:19:06,485 --&gt; 00:19:11,124
咋了? 大家不是都跟祖寇搭伴做过野外旅行了吗

271
00:19:11,139 --&gt; 00:19:12,224
现在该轮到我了

272
00:19:20,850 --&gt; 00:19:27,664
安昂，安昂，安昂...

273
00:19:29,294 --&gt; 00:19:31,838
神通形态，驾，驾

274
00:19:34,630 --&gt; 00:19:37,370
九岁的时候，我又离家出走了

275
00:19:37,370 --&gt; 00:19:37,959
是吗

276
00:19:37,959 --&gt; 00:19:39,583
我知道我不应该抱怨的

277
00:19:39,583 --&gt; 00:19:41,966
我要什么我爸妈都能满足我的要求

278
00:19:41,966 --&gt; 00:19:45,132
不过我真正想要的，他们却从未给过我

279
00:19:45,172 --&gt; 00:19:46,073
他们的爱

280
00:19:46,073 --&gt; 00:19:47,529
你知道我的意思吗？

281
00:19:48,680 --&gt; 00:19:51,001
听着，我知道你的童年不好过

282
00:19:51,001 --&gt; 00:19:53,310
不过现在的当务之急是要找到安昂

283
00:19:54,377 --&gt; 00:19:56,818
这真是史上最烂的野外考察了

284
00:20:04,301 --&gt; 00:20:08,219
看你们的表情，想必你们也没找到安昂

285
00:20:09,219 --&gt; 00:20:13,750
没找到，他就好像... 人间蒸发了一样

286
00:20:13,750 --&gt; 00:20:17,973
嘿，等等，大家没发现模模也不见了吗？

287
00:20:17,973 --&gt; 00:20:22,149
哦，不！我就知道这件事迟早会发生的

288
00:20:23,254 --&gt; 00:20:25,197
阿柏把模模吃掉了

289
00:20:25,208 --&gt; 00:20:27,431
模模，我来找你了，伙计

290
00:20:27,431 --&gt; 00:20:30,280
索卡，阿柏没吃模模啦

291
00:20:30,280 --&gt; 00:20:32,022
它应该跟安昂在一起

292
00:20:32,022 --&gt; 00:20:34,354
你要是那么想，可就上了阿柏的圈套了

293
00:20:35,354 --&gt; 00:20:37,600
索卡，赶快从野牛的嘴里出来

294
00:20:37,600 --&gt; 00:20:39,364
这件事咱们得讨论一下

295
00:20:39,364 --&gt; 00:20:42,591
还有两天彗星即将出现，安昂又不知所踪了

296
00:20:42,591 --&gt; 00:20:43,949
祖寇，我们该怎么做？

297
00:20:45,283 --&gt; 00:20:46,517
我不知道

298
00:20:49,640 --&gt; 00:20:51,620
你们都看着我做什么？

299
00:20:51,620 --&gt; 00:20:54,686
你可是追踪安昂的行家里手啊

300
00:20:54,686 --&gt; 00:20:58,787
你在追踪神通方便经验丰富啊

301
00:21:03,553 --&gt; 00:21:05,881
祖寇，我不是想干涉你

302
00:21:05,881 --&gt; 00:21:07,980
不过我们为什么要去土强国呢？

303
00:21:07,980 --&gt; 00:21:09,329
安昂怎么会在那儿呢？

304
00:21:09,329 --&gt; 00:21:10,949
相信我没错的

305
00:21:30,879 --&gt; 00:21:33,402
快点，废物，再快点

306
00:21:53,933 --&gt; 00:21:56,628
对不起，父皇，我迟到了

307
00:21:56,628 --&gt; 00:22:00,021
这年头好轿夫真是越来越难找了

308
00:22:00,021 --&gt; 00:22:02,887
我们可以启程了吧？

309
00:22:02,887 --&gt; 00:22:05,541
阿祖拉，计划有变

310
00:22:05,541 --&gt; 00:22:06,129
什么？

311
00:22:06,129 --&gt; 00:22:10,467
朕决定独自指挥战舰开往永固城

312
00:22:10,967 --&gt; 00:22:13,294
你就留在烈火国这里吧

313
00:22:14,521 --&gt; 00:22:16,963
我们不是要一起作此大事的吗

314
00:22:16,963 --&gt; 00:22:19,246
朕意已决

315
00:22:19,757 --&gt; 00:22:22,682
您... 您不能这样对我，

316
00:22:22,682 --&gt; 00:22:24,644
您不能像对待祖寇那样对我

317
00:22:24,644 --&gt; 00:22:27,335
阿祖拉，给我冷静点

318
00:22:27,335 --&gt; 00:22:29,872
可把一切都烧为平地可是我的主意

319
00:22:29,872 --&gt; 00:22:32,015
我理应在您身旁与您并肩战斗

320
00:22:32,015 --&gt; 00:22:33,051
阿祖拉！

321
00:22:34,392 --&gt; 00:22:39,242
听我说，我想让你在后方看管烈火国

322
00:22:39,242 --&gt; 00:22:42,872
这个任务事关重大，我能信任的也只有你了

323
00:22:43,734 --&gt; 00:22:45,012
真的吗？

324
00:22:45,277 --&gt; 00:22:51,594
鉴于你一向忠心耿耿，我决定册封你为新的烈火王

325
00:22:51,594 --&gt; 00:22:53,976
烈火王阿祖拉？

326
00:22:53,976 --&gt; 00:22:58,658
这个称号对我来说太合适了，那您呢？

327
00:22:58,658 --&gt; 00:23:01,854
再也没有烈火王欧宰了

328
00:23:01,854 --&gt; 00:23:05,720
就像世界将从烈焰中重生一样

329
00:23:05,720 --&gt; 00:23:10,188
我将重生为世界的主宰

330
00:23:10,188 --&gt; 00:23:16,851
即刻起，我就是凤凰大帝

331
00:23:47,843 --&gt; 00:23:52,036
你为啥要把我们带到这个破土宗酒馆来啊？

332
00:23:52,036 --&gt; 00:23:52,741
珍

333
00:23:56,841 --&gt; 00:24:00,093
哦，她不就是那个有大鼹鼠的赏金猎人吗？

334
00:24:00,100 --&gt; 00:24:02,642
是因为她的无暇肌肤吗？

335
00:24:02,642 --&gt; 00:24:05,791
不，应该是借想用她的鼹鼠吧

336
00:24:05,791 --&gt; 00:24:10,418
那是麝鼠，是世上唯一可能追踪到安昂气味的动物

337
00:24:10,418 --&gt; 00:24:12,515
我们只能期望它能找到安昂了

338
00:24:25,187 --&gt; 00:24:29,112
虽不知这位珍小姐到底是何许人也，不过我喜欢她

339
00:24:35,915 --&gt; 00:24:39,833
嘿，模模，我刚才做了个怪梦

340
00:24:42,679 --&gt; 00:24:47,311
等等...

341
00:24:53,419 --&gt; 00:24:54,732
我们这是在哪儿啊？
（这意境好像LOST啊）

342
