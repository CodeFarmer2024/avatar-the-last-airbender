      [Introduction Sequence]

      [&quot;Previously on Avatar&quot; sequence includes clips from The Awakening]

      Act I

      (The episode opens with the camera panning up the outer slope of the Fire
      Nation capital city volcano. It pans up to the crater wherein lies the
      royal city, and pauses. Cut to the Fire Lord&#x27;s palace. Cut to Zuko&#x27;s
      bedroom. The prince is tossing and turning, unable to sleep. He rises from
      bed and dons a hooded cloak. Slipping by an unguarded path over the
      crater&#x27;s rim, he makes his way to a prison tower embedded in the slope of
      another, nearby volcano. As he stands in the prison courtyard, looking
      upward, a guard spots him.)

      Guard: Who&#x27;s there?

      (Without a word, Zuko turns and leaves.

      Cut to the Fire Nation outer islands, daytime. A mysterious cloud is
      scudding rapidly over the water. As it lights on one of the islands,
      voices emanate from it.)

      Aang: I think I see a cave below.
      Sokka: Shhush... keep quiet! (The cloud disperses with a blast of
      airbending to reveal the kids, riding Appa. Sokka dismounts and begins a
      furtive reconnaissance.) Great job with the cloud camo, but next time,
      let&#x27;s disguise ourselves as the kind of cloud who knows how to keep its
      mouth shut.
      Toph: (sarcastically) Yeah, we wouldn&#x27;t want a bird to hear us chatting up
      there and turn us in.

      Sokka: Hey! We&#x27;re in enemy territory. Those are enemy birds.

      (He points upward to four of the enemy, perched on a rock just behind him.
      One hops down onto his head and squawks plaintively. The kids laugh. Sokka
      is unamused. They walk toward the cave, Sokka lurking behind. Of a sudden,
      he leaps over their heads to ward off some [entirely imaginary] threat.
      Peering suspiciously about, he dashes into the cave, followed by the rest
      of the gaang.)

      Sokka: Well, this is it. This is how we&#x27;ll be living until the invasion
      begins. Hiding in cave after cave...after cave...after cave...

      (His head drops further to his chest with each repetition of the word.)

      Katara: Sokka, we don&#x27;t need to become cave people. What we need is some
      new clothes.
      Aang: Yeah, blending in is better than hiding out. If we get Fire Nation
      disguises, we&#x27;ll be just as safe as we would be hiding in a cave.
      Toph: Plus...they have real food out there. Does anyone wanna sit in the
      dirt and eat cave-hoppers?

      (She punches the cave wall and several hoppers hop out. Momo catches one
      and begins chowing down. The kids appear revolted.)

      Sokka: (to Momo) Looks like we got out voted, sport. (To the kids) Let&#x27;s
      get some new clothes.

      (The scene shifts to a nearby Fire Nation laundry. Several items of
      clothing are hung on lines outdoors, suspended over steam vents. The kids,
      hiding in some rocks close by, survey the scene.)

      Aang: I don&#x27;t know about this. These clothes belong to somebody.
      Katara: I call the silk robe!

      (She leaps from the rocks, runs to her prize and snatches it from the
      line.)

      Aang: But if it&#x27;s essential to our survival...then I call the suit!

      (Plunder ensues. The laundry&#x27;s lone attendant, stealing a nap in the
      doorway, is oblivious.

      Cut to a secluded beach nearby. The kids are trying on their new duds. A
      shot of Aang from behind, tying the belt from his suit around his forehead
      to conceal his arrow. He turns around.)

      Aang: Ta-dah! Normal kid.
      Toph: Hmm...I should probably wear shoes, but then I won&#x27;t be able to see
      as well. Sorry shoes! (Sitting down, she brings her knee up to her chest,
      pulling on the shoe&#x27;s upper and popping out the sole with her foot, which
      propels it into Sokka&#x27;s face. She stands up and evaluates her new
      customized footwear.) Finally, a stylish shoe for the blind earthbender.
      Katara: (partially visible in the right side of the screen, from behind)
      How do I look?

      (Cut to a full frontal shot of Katara, presumably from Aang&#x27;s p.o.v. The
      camera slowly pans upward from toe to top to reveal a ravishing Fire
      Nation beauty... with one false note. Aang, smitten, blushes, and then
      suddenly realizes the problem.)

      Aang: Uh...your mom&#x27;s necklace.
      Katara: (chagrined) Oh...oh, yeah. I guess it&#x27;s pretty obviously water
      tribe, isn&#x27;t it?

      (Relunctantly, she removes it.

      The scene changes to the bazaar of a nearby town, where Katara buys some
      new, more fire-themed neckware. Cut to an alley, where she puts it on and
      Toph and Sokka try on their own new accessories - a new headband for Toph
      and a topknot clasp for Sokka. For his part, Aang smoothes down Momo&#x27;s
      ears and tucks him beneath his coat.)

      Aang: I used to visit my friend Kuzon here a hundred years ago. So
      everyone just follow my lead and stay cool. Or as they say in the Fire
      Nation - &quot;Stay flamin&#x27;&quot;! (He saunters out, the kids following. A man is
      eating a meat shish kebab on the sidewalk. Aang waves to him as they walk
      by.) Greetings, my good Hotman!
      Fire Nation Citizen: (surprised) Uh, hi. I guess?

      (Aang&#x27;s lingo is perhaps a little out of date.

      Sokka leads the way to a butcher&#x27;s shop.)

      Aang: Oh, we&#x27;re going to a meat place?
      Sokka: Come on, Aang. Every one here eats meat...even the meat!

      (He indicates a nearby cow-hippo, greedily scavenging a pile of fly-blown
      fish.)

      Aang: (unconvinced) You guys go ahead. I&#x27;ll just get some lettuce out of
      the garbage.

      (They enter. Aang turns around and begins dispensing affable greetings to
      his new countrymen.)

      Aang: Hotman. Hotman. Hotman. Hotman. Hotman.

      (Three imposing, official-looking figures approach him.)

      Fire Nation Officer: It&#x27;s over, we caught you.
      Aang: Who me?
      Fire Nation Officer: It couldn&#x27;t be more obvious that you don&#x27;t belong
      here. (Aang cringes, expecting the worst.) Next time you play hooky, you
      might want to take off your school uniform.
      Aang: Heh, heh. Uh!

      (He is seized by the collar and pulled towards the camera.

      Cut to the exterior of the Fire Nation school, dominated by a large statue
      of Ozai. Cut to an interior classroom. The door opens and Aang is thrust
      in. He and his new classmates stare at each other in mutual astonishment.)

      Teacher (Ms. Kwan): Oh! Is this a new mind ready for molding?
      Aang: That&#x27;s right. (He knocks himself on the head to indicate its lack of
      contents.) Let the molding begin.

      (The truant officers turn to leave.)

      Ms. Kwan: Wait a minute. (The officers stop and turn around.) You&#x27;re not
      from the Fire Nation! (Suspenseful moment. Ms. Kwan approaches Aang with a
      critical eye.) Clearly you&#x27;re from the colonies.
      Aang: (relieved) Yeah, the colonies. Of course. The Fire Nation colonies
      in the Earth Kingdom.
      Ms. Kwan: Your etiquette is terrible. In the homeland, we bow to our
      elders. Like so.

      (She bows her head, making a fist with her right hand, holding her left
      hand open and pointed upward so that the palm is perpendicular to her
      body, and bringing the two hands together so that the proximal phalanx of
      her infolded right index finger just touches the base of her left palm,
      again perpendicularly. The effect is of a small, stylized flame.)

      Aang: Sorry ma&#x27;am.

      (Aang attempts the salute, but reverses hands and meets his right palm
      with his entire left fist, instead of just the index finger. Ms. Kwan taps
      his fist with her ferrule, obviously disapproving. Aang looks around for
      help. A girl in the front row [On Ji] catches his eye and demonstrates the
      proper technique. Aang smiles, reverses hands, and lowers his fist.)

      Ms. Kwan: (tapping his head with her ferrule) And we don&#x27;t wear head
      coverings indoors.
      Aang: Um, I have a scar. It&#x27;s really embarrassing.
      Ms. Kwan: Very well. What is your name? Or should we just call you,
      &quot;Mannerless Colony Slob&quot;?
      Aang: (chuckling) Just &quot;Slob&quot; is fine. (This doesn&#x27;t go over well. He
      tries a different tack.) Or, uh... Kuzon.

      (He turns to face the class with a friendly smile.

      Cut to a shot of a bell ringing, signaling school&#x27;s out. Kids stream out
      the doors. Aang walks toward the camera, pulling open his jacket and
      whispering to Momo.)

      Aang: We made it through the day, Momo. And...it was pretty fun!
      On Ji: (from behind him) Don&#x27;t let the headmaster catch you with that
      monkey.
      Aang: (concealing Momo and turning around with an innocent grin on his
      face) What monkey?
      On Ji: Don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;m not a tattletale. My name&#x27;s On Ji. I like your
      headband, by the way.

      (Aang smiles, meditating a reply, when he is suddenly jostled from behind
      by a tall Fire Nation boy [Hide], who walks past him to stand by On Ji.)

      Hide: (contemptuously) On Ji, you don&#x27;t have to baby-sit the new kid.
      Aang: (amiably) Wow. (He bows, Fire Nation style.) You must be one of
      those popular kids I&#x27;ve been hearing about.
      Hide: That&#x27;s right. Now listen, friend...I know you&#x27;re from the colonies,
      so I&#x27;ll say this slowly. (He enunciates carefully, getting in Aang&#x27;s face
      as he does so.) On Ji...is...my...girlfriend. Don&#x27;t forget it.

      (He pokes Aang in the chest. Momo stirs and complains beneath Aang&#x27;s
      jacket. Aang smoothes him down and grins sheepishly at Hide&#x27;s suspicious
      glare. Hide points at his eyes and then at Aang to indicate that he&#x27;ll be
      keeping an eye on him. He turns and walks away with his arm around On Ji.)

      Aang: It was nice meeting you.
      Small Fire Nation Boy (Shoji): (approaching Aang) I don&#x27;t believe it. He
      didn&#x27;t beat you up. Not even a little.
      Aang: (modestly) I guess I&#x27;m just lucky.
      Shoji: We were on our way to play hide-and-explode. You wanna come?
      Aang: I&#x27;d love to!

      (Cut to the exterior of the cave, night. Aang slides down the roof of the
      cave to its entrance and walks in. The kids are seated around a fire.)

      Katara: Where have you been? We&#x27;ve been worried sick!
      Aang: (covered in burn marks) I got invited to play with some kids after
      school.
      Sokka: (standing up, flummoxed) After what?
      Aang: (happily) I enrolled in a Fire Nation school, and I&#x27;m going back
      tomorrow.
      Sokka: Enrolled in what?!

      (He keels over.

      Cut to the prison tower. An interior shot of feet walking down a corridor.
      The guard from the beginning of the episode hears the footsteps and spins
      around, leveling his spear. He recognizes the hooded figure.)

      Guard: You again? Stop where you are. (The figure raises its head,
      revealing a well-known face with a telltale scar.) Prince Zuko?! (Zuko
      grabs him by the collar and slams him against the wall.) Uhg!
      Zuko: (in a tone of insolent menace) I&#x27;m going in for a visit. You&#x27;re
      gonna stand guard here, and no one is going to know about this.

      (Cut to an overhead shot of Iroh&#x27;s cell. The cell is bisected by a wall of
      bars so that one half is accessible from the door and the other half
      serves as a cage. Iroh, unkempt and dressed in rags, is seated crosslegged
      on a mat, facing the wall to the right of the cell door as one enters it.
      Zuko walks in and up to the bars.)

      Zuko: Uncle. It&#x27;s me.

      (He removes his hood. Iroh turns away to face the back of his cell,
      scowling. Cut to commercial.)

      Act II

      (Scene: the interior of the cave. The kids are seated around the fire.)

      Sokka: Aang, I&#x27;m trying to be mature and not immediately shoot down your
      idea. But it sounds...really terrible.
      Toph: Yeah, we got our outfits. What do you need to go to school for?
      Aang: Every minute I&#x27;m in that classroom. I&#x27;m learning new things about
      the fire nation. I already have a picture of Fire Lord Ozai. (He holds it
      up towards the camera.) And here&#x27;s one that I made out of noodles!

      (He displays his masterpiece to the camera.)

      Sokka: Impressive, I admit. But I still think it&#x27;s too dangerous.
      Aang: (deviously) I guess we&#x27;ll never find out about the secret river
      then. It goes right to the Fire Lord&#x27;s palace. We were supposed to learn
      about it in class tomorrow...
      Sokka: Hmm... I am a fan of secret rivers. (relenting) Fine, let&#x27;s stay a
      few more days.
      Aang: Flamey-o, Hotman!

      (He runs off in excitement.)

      Sokka: (turning to Katara) Flamey-o??
      Katara: (shrugging her shoulders) Mmm-mm?

      (Cut back to Iroh&#x27;s cell.)

      Zuko: (standing at the bars) You brought this on yourself, you know. We
      could have returned together. You could have been a hero! (Iroh turns a
      shade further away from Zuko.) You have no right to judge me Uncle. I did
      what I had to do in Ba Sing Se, and you&#x27;re a fool for not joining me.
      (Iroh is silent.) You&#x27;re not gonna say anything? (Enraged, he kicks a
      stool and bends a blast of fire at the wall.) Ahhrr! You&#x27;re a crazy old
      man! You&#x27;re crazy, and if you weren&#x27;t in jail, you&#x27;d be sleeping in a
      gutter!

      (He leaves, slamming the door behind him. Iroh bows his head, closing his
      eyes.

      Cut to the Fire Nation classroom. Ms. Kwan enters and the children rise.)

      Ms. Kwan: Good morning, class. Recite the Fire Nation oath.

      (They turn to the larger-than-life portrait of Ozai that dominates the
      room&#x27;s rear wall, bow Fire Nation style and begin reciting. Aang stands up
      awkwardly, a few beats behind everyone else, and does his best to follow
      along.)

      Students: My life, I give to my country. With my hands, I fight for Fire
      Lord Ozai and our forefathers before him...
      Aang: Fire Lord...forefathers...
      Students: With my mind, I seek ways to better my country, and with my
      feet...
      Aang: (desperately) Firebenders...Fire Lord...blah, blah, blah, blah.

      (The other students stop reciting and begin giggling helplessly. Ms. Kwan
      scowls. The kids turn back around and sit down.)

      Ms. Kwan: (rising and striking the open book before her with her ferrule
      for emphasis) Since it&#x27;s obviously hilarious to mock our national oath,
      we&#x27;ll begin with a pop quiz on our Great March of Civilization.

      (The students groan and take pens and paper in hand.)

      Ms. Kwan: Question one: What year did Fire Lord Sozin battle the Air
      Nation Army? (Aang raises his hand. She acknowledges him suspiciously.)
      Kuzon?
      Aang: (rising) Is that a trick question? The Air Nomads didn&#x27;t have a
      formal military. Sozin defeated them by ambush.

      (The entire class stares openmouthed at this brazen heresy.)

      Ms. Kwan: (flustered) Well, I don&#x27;t know how you could possibly know more
      than our national history book. Unless you were there a hundred years ago.

      Aang: (thinking better of it and sitting down) I&#x27;ll just write down my
      best guess.

      (Cut to band practice, in a different classroom. The music teacher taps
      his stand and the amateur orchestra commences playing. Aang, armed with a
      Tsungi horn, pauses a few moments to draw in a deep breath and suddenly
      lets fly a boisterous blast of something resembling music, maniacally
      dancing in place as he does so. The rest of the class stops playing,
      dumbfounded.)

      Music Teacher: Kuzon?
      Aang: (stops playing) I know. I&#x27;m a terrible Tsungi hornist.
      Music Teacher: No, child. That hullabaloo going on with your feet. Is that
      a nervous disorder?
      Aang: I was just dancing. You do dances here in the homeland, right?
      Shoji: (sitting beside him) Not really, no.
      Music Teacher: (walking to the window) Dancing is not conducive to a
      proper learning environment. Young people must have rigid discipline and
      order.
      Aang: But what about expressing yourself?
      Music Teacher: (walking back to his stand) I know sometimes we&#x27;re so moved
      by our love for our nation, that we can&#x27;t control our own bodies.
      (Overcome with emotion, he claps his hand to his face and reconsiders.) If
      you must, you may march in place quietly next time the urge hits you.

      (The orchestra recommences, Aang marching quietly as directed but clearly
      malcontent.

      Cut to the school courtyard. It appears to be recess, or lunch, and kids
      are scattered about the yard. As Aang exits the school building and enters
      the yard, the kids spot him and begin whispering; clearly, he has caused a
      sensation.)

      On Ji: (approaching him) Oh, hi, Kuzon. I really liked that crazy dance
      you were doing.
      Aang: Thanks, On Ji. I could show it to you again, if you&#x27;d like.

      (He starts and yells as a blast of fire hits him from off-screen. Cut to
      Hide, across the yard, who has thrown the blast.)

      Hide: What&#x27;d you say, colony trash? You&#x27;re gonna show her something?

      (He approaches them.)

      Aang: Just some dance movements.
      Hide: Nobody shows my On Ji anything, especially movements.

      (He lunges at Aang, who steps neatly out of the way. For the next several
      seconds, Hide tries to land a blow on Aang, who is too quick and agile to
      be caught. At last, Hide is propelled by his own momentum onto the ground.
      At this unfavorable juncture, the School Headmaster enters the scene, and
      naturally assumes that Aang has been bullying Hide, rather than the other
      way around.)

      School Headmaster: Picking fights on your second day? We need to have a
      conference to discuss your punishment. Bring your parents to my office
      after school.
      Aang: Parents? But...
      School Headmaster: Don&#x27;t be late.

      (He turns and leaves, followed by a smirking Hide. Aang is momentarily
      crestfallen - but suddenly appears to have an idea.

      Cut to the Headmaster&#x27;s office. Pan down from the obligatory portrait of
      Ozai on the wall to the Headmaster, sitting directly beneath it.)

      School Headmaster: Thank you for coming, Mr. And Mrs...

      (The camera cuts to Sokka, Aang, and Katara, in that order, seated facing
      the Headmaster. Sokka is wearing a fake moustache and beard. Katara&#x27;s hair
      is tied up in two buns on either side of her head, and her waist is padded
      to mimic pregnancy.)

      Sokka: Fire! Wang Fire. This is my wife, Sapphire.
      Katara: Sapphire Fire, nice to meet you.
      School Headmaster: (dubiously) Mr. and Mrs...Fire, your son has been
      enrolled here for two days, and he&#x27;s already causing problems. He&#x27;s argued
      with his history teacher, disrupted music class, and roughed up my star
      pupil.
      Katara: My goodness! That doesn&#x27;t sound like our Kuzon.
      School Headmaster: (indulgently) That&#x27;s what any mother would say, ma&#x27;am.
      Nonetheless, you&#x27;re forewarned. If he acts up one more time, I&#x27;ll have him
      sent to reform school... (cut to a menacing close-up of the Headmaster&#x27;s
      face)...by which I mean the coal mines. Are we clear?
      Sokka: Don&#x27;t you worry, Mr. Headmaster. I&#x27;ll straighten this boy out
      somethin&#x27; fierce. (He blusters in Aang&#x27;s face.) Young man, as soon as we
      get home, you&#x27;re gonna get the punishment of a lifetime!
      School Headmaster: (with an air of subdued sadism) That&#x27;s what I like to
      hear.

      (The kids rise and leave, Sokka swaggering proudly...the role of
      overbearing father figure seems to suit him.

      Cut to a sheltered little plateau on the rim of the royal volcano. Zuko
      and Mai are enjoying a sunset picnic and a chance to canoodle in private.)

      Mai: (referring to the sunset) Orange is such an awful color.
      Zuko: (snickering) You&#x27;re so beautiful when you hate the world.
      Mai: I don&#x27;t hate you.
      Zuko: I don&#x27;t hate you, too.

      (They kiss.)

      Azula: (off-screen) Ahem! (The two lovers look up at her in irritation.)
      Zuko, could I have a word with you?
      Zuko: Can&#x27;t you see we&#x27;re busy?

      (He and Mai resume their &quot;business&quot;.)

      Azula: (not to be put off) Oh, Mai...Ty Lee needs your help untangling her
      braid.
      Mai: (complaisantly) Sounds pretty serious.

      (She gets up and leaves. Walking past Azula, towards the camera, she
      shoots the princess a quick, poisonous glance behind her back.)

      Azula: So...I hear you&#x27;ve been to visit your Uncle Fatso in the prison
      tower.
      Zuko: (standing, incensed) That guard told you.
      Azula: (smugly) No, you did. Just now.
      Zuko: (sitting back down) Okay, you caught me. What is it that you want,
      Azula?
      Azula: (solicitiously) Actually, nothing. Believe it or not, I&#x27;m looking
      out for you. If people find out you&#x27;ve been to see Uncle, they&#x27;ll think
      you&#x27;re plotting with him. Just be careful, dum-dum.

      (Zuko looks up at her suspiciously.

      Cut to the cave and a close-up of Sokka&#x27;s face, still bearded, as he bends
      over Aang and rants at him.)

      Sokka: That settles it. No more school for you young man!

      (He straightens up and strokes his beard imperiously.)

      Aang: I&#x27;m not ready to leave. I&#x27;m having fun for once, just being a normal
      kid. You don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s like, Sokka. You get to be normal all the
      time.
      Toph: (mockingly) Ha, ha.

      (Sokka scowls.)

      Aang: Listen, guys, those kids at school are the future of the Fire
      Nation. If we wanna change this place for the better, we need to show them
      a little taste of freedom.
      Sokka: What could you possibly do for a country of depraved little fire
      monsters?
      Aang: I&#x27;m gonna throw them...(he does a quick tap dance flourish)...a
      secret dance party!

      (The kids are stunned. Sokka is the first to recover.)

      Sokka: (pointing) Go to your room!

      (Cut to commercial.)

      Act III

      (Scene: the interior of the cave, later that same night. Toph earthbends a
      bandstand from the cave floor.)

      Sokka: (arranging candles) I can&#x27;t believe we&#x27;re having a dance party. It
      seems so... silly.
      Aang: Don&#x27;t think of it as a dance party, but as a cultural event
      celebrating the art of fancy footwork.

      (He demonstrates his fancy footwork as Katara bends beverage into an
      earthbended punchbowl in the background. Cut to a shot of Fire Nation kids
      approaching the cave. Cut back to the cave interior, where Toph has
      suddenly felt the vibrations of their feet.)

      Toph: They&#x27;re coming! Everyone stop bending!
      Aang: (approaching Appa) Sorry, buddy. You should probably wait out back.
      (Appa grumbles and shuffles into a tunnel at the back of the cave.) I
      know, you&#x27;ve got fancier feet than anybody...and six of &#x27;em!

      (Cut to a quick montage of Fire Nation kids playing various musical
      instruments on the bandstand. Cut to a wide shot of the entire band. Aang
      leaps in front of them exultantly and, facing them, spreads his arms
      wide.)

      Aang: Ladies and gentlemen, The Flamey-os! Yeah, this ought to get
      everybody moving.

      (He turns around. It hasn&#x27;t. The Fire Nation kids are standing, huddled
      together, uncertain.)

      Shoji: Now what do we do?
      Aang: This is when you start dancing.
      Fire Nation Boy 1: (as his head disappears into his collar like a turtle&#x27;s
      into its shell) I don&#x27;t think my parents want me dancing in a cave.
      Fire Nation Boy 2: Yeah, what if someone finds out?

      (He looks around anxiously and scuttles off-screen.)

      Aang: Oh, boy. Listen, guys...dancing isn&#x27;t something you think about.
      It&#x27;s a form of self-expression that no one can ever take away from you.
      Shoji: Maybe it was different in the colonies, Kuzon. But we don&#x27;t do that
      here.
      Aang: Sure you do. You have for generations. It just so happens that I
      know several classic fire nation dances. A hundred years ago, this was
      known as &quot;the Phoenix flight.&quot;

      (He runs in a circle, squatting and kicking his legs in the fashion of
      Russian folk dance, his arms stretched straight out behind him in
      imitation of wings. The students ooh and aah.)

      Aang: And this was the &quot;camelephant strut&quot;.

      (He hops on one foot toward the camera, alternating feet with each hop,
      passing his palms in front of his face as he does so. He turns a
      somersault through the air and lands in front of two girls, who giggle,
      embarrassed. He somersaults backwards and lands expertly on one foot,
      bowing. The students are amazed. Cut to Toph and Katara, sitting to the
      side, drinking beverage.)

      Toph: Who knew Twinkletoes could dance?

      (Katara smiles.

      Cut to the interior of Iroh&#x27;s cell. Zuko kneels and passes a packet of
      food through the bars.)

      Zuko: I brought you some komodo-chicken. I know you don&#x27;t care for it, but
      I figure it beats prison food. (Iroh, sitting down, is silent, his back to
      his nephew.) I admit it. I have everything I always wanted, but it&#x27;s not
      at all how I thought it would be. The truth is, I need your advice. (He
      clenches the bars.) I think the Avatar is still alive. I know he&#x27;s out
      there. I&#x27;m losing my mind. (desperately) Please, Uncle, I&#x27;m so confused! I
      need your help. (Iroh is motionless. Zuko stands, enraged.) Forget it!
      I&#x27;ll solve this myself! Waste away in here for all I care!

      (He walks to the door and opens it, turning back for just a moment, and
      then quickly slams the door. Cut to a close-up side profile of Iroh&#x27;s
      face. A single tear rolls down his cheek.

      Cut back to the cave. Aang, somersaulting through the air, lands in front
      of On Ji, who is looking away bashfully. A friend nudges her and she looks
      up at Aang, who extends his hand to her. She blushes as he leads her out
      to the dance floor.)

      Aang: And this is how they do it in the ballrooms of Ba Sing Se.

      (He passes his arms in an undulating motion across his chest, stepping
      from side to side as he does so. On Ji imitates him.)

      Sokka: Wow, they look pretty good together.
      Katara: (dismissively, looking away) Eh, if that&#x27;s what you like.

      (She steals a jealous glance at the couple.

      More of the kids join Aang and On Ji. The crowd is loosening up.)

      Aang: Yeah, that&#x27;s it. That&#x27;s the sound of happy feet. All right, go with
      that. Everybody freestyle!

      (Cut to a lengthy shot of a Fire Nation boy doing an elaborate &quot;freestyle&quot;
      dance, reminiscent of juba dancing. Cut to a shot of the remaining crowd,
      who are slowly beginning to get their groove on. Cut to Katara, sitting
      alone at a table with her head in her hand. She looks up. Aang is standing
      in front of her, hand outstretched.)

      Katara: I don&#x27;t know, Aang. These shoes aren&#x27;t really right for dancing,
      and I&#x27;m not sure
      that I know how to...
      Aang: (masterfully) Take my hand.
      Katara: Okay.

      (He leads her out to the center of the floor and whispers in her ear. They
      stretch out their arms and touch wrists, circling around the axis thus
      formed.)

      Katara: Aang, everyone&#x27;s watching.
      Aang: Don&#x27;t worry about them. It&#x27;s just you and me right now.

      (She looks into his eyes, blushing, and then confident. They begin an
      elaborate dance that seems to be based off capoeira, cartwheeling through
      the air, crouching, and kicking over one another&#x27;s heads. The crowd stops
      dancing and watches them, entranced.

      Cut to the exterior of the cave, some distance away. The Headmaster,
      accompanied by three truant officers and Hide, sees the light and hears
      the music from the cave and scowls.)

      School Headmaster: It is a dancing party. You did the right thing by
      telling me, Hide.

      Hide: (bowing) Anytime, Headmaster, sir.

      (Cut to the interior of the cave, where the party is in full swing.)

      Fire Nation Boy 1: (dancing) This is incredible. It&#x27;s like my inhibitions
      just disappeared. (The Headmaster and his entourage enter the cave, and
      the dancing grinds to a halt. The boy&#x27;s head shrinks back into his
      collar.) Okay. They&#x27;re...back again.

      (Aang, oblivious, dances across the screen.)

      Headmaster: He&#x27;s the one we want. (Aang looks up, alarmed.) The boy with
      the headband!

      (He points and the truant officers make a beeline for Aang.)

      Aang: Uh-oh.

      (Aang dashes into the crowd, an officer following close behind. The crowd
      parts in front of the officer to reveal a lone figure with his back turned
      to the camera, wearing a headband.)

      Officer: Got ya!

      (He grabs the figure by the shoulder and turns him around. It is Shoji,
      who has tied his belt around his head in imitation of Aang.)

      Shoji: (smiling) Looking for me?
      School Headmaster: That&#x27;s not the one! He&#x27;s here somewhere. Don&#x27;t let him
      leave the cave!

      (The officers dart through the crowd, the Headmaster joining them.
      Headbands are multiplying everywhere. One by one the officers snag them,
      only to discover one wide-eyed innocent face after another.)

      On Ji: Yes?
      Fire Nation Boy 2: Hi there.
      Fire Nation Boy 1: How we doing?
      Fire Nation Boy 3: Looking for someone?

      (The officers, disoriented, back into a small knot in the middle of the
      cave as the students encircle them. By now the entire student body has
      morphed into replicas of Aang. The camera sweeps across them.)

      Fire Nation Student: Who are you looking for?
      Shoji: Do you need something?
      Students: Over here.

      (Cut to the back of the cave. The gaang are escaping down the tunnel Appa
      disappeared into earlier. Aang, last out, stops and turns back for a
      moment. Shoji, at the edge of the crowd, turns and winks at him. Aang bows
      [Fire Nation style] and runs down the tunnel. Two walls of rock abruptly
      slam across the tunnel&#x27;s entrance, sealing it off. Shoji gapes as he
      realizes his new friend is a despised earthbender.

      Cut to the Headmaster, who is still standing, fuming, in the center of the
      cave, flanked by his officers. Two of them cannot restrain themselves and
      are discreetly swaying to the music [which miraculously is still playing].
      The Headmaster admonishes them.)

      Headmaster: Stop that. Stop that!

      (They quickly stand to attention.

      Cut to the gaang, safely ensconced in Appa&#x27;s saddle and flying away
      through the night sky.)

      Katara: We&#x27;re safe, Sokka. You can take off the moustache, now.
      Sokka: (smugly) Oh, no, I can&#x27;t. It&#x27;s permanently glued to my skin.

      (He strokes it, unaccountably pleased with himself.)

      Toph: Way to go, Dancypants. I think you really did help those kids. You
      taught them to be free.
      Aang: I don&#x27;t know. It was just a dance party, that&#x27;s all.
      Katara: Well, that was some dance party, Aang.

      (She leans over and kisses him on the cheek. He blushes. Cut to Sokka,
      sitting crosslegged near the pommel.)

      Sokka: (rocking lazily back and forth and clapping his hands slowly like a
      tranced-out beatnik) Flamey-o, sir. Flame-ee-o.

      (Cut to a seedy industrial quarter somewhere in the Fire Nation.
      Smokestacks cloud the night sky. Pan downward to a small yard bisected by
      railroad tracks. Zuko, hooded, walks into the middle of the yard and
      removes his hood. A clanking noise is heard off-camera. Two large boots,
      one of them metal, stamp into view to frame the screen, Zuko visible
      between them, facing the wearer of the boots.)

      Zuko: You&#x27;re sure you weren&#x27;t followed? (Cut to a side view. Zuko is
      speaking to an ominous looking figure twice his height.) I&#x27;ve heard about
      you. They say you&#x27;re good at what you do. And even better at keeping
      secrets. The Avatar&#x27;s alive. I want you to find him. (Cut to a close-up of
      Zuko&#x27;s face.) And end him.

      (Cut to a close-up of Combustion Man&#x27;s face. Cue the scary music. Zoom
      inward to the inverted eye tattoo on his forehead. Fade to credits.)

      [End Credits]

头饰带

29
00:01:58,817 --&gt; 00:01:59,660
谁在那儿？

30
00:02:12,570 --&gt; 00:02:14,286
我看到下面有一个山洞

31
00:02:14,286 --&gt; 00:02:16,181
嘘，小点声

32
00:02:23,826 --&gt; 00:02:26,085
这次迷彩云弄得不错，不过下一次

33
00:02:26,085 --&gt; 00:02:29,694
咱们最好伪装成不会说话的那种云彩

34
00:02:30,500 --&gt; 00:02:34,350
哼，莫非你怕那些鸟听见举报咱们

35
00:02:34,350 --&gt; 00:02:36,617
嘿，这可是敌人的领地

36
00:02:36,617 --&gt; 00:02:38,496
这些鸟也是敌鸟

37
00:02:54,796 --&gt; 00:02:56,900
好了，终于到了

38
00:02:56,900 --&gt; 00:02:58,801
在侵入计划实行之前我们就这么过吧

39
00:02:59,235 --&gt; 00:03:00,753
从一个山洞躲进另一个山洞...

40
00:03:00,753 --&gt; 00:03:05,755
又一个山洞....

41
00:03:05,755 --&gt; 00:03:07,464
索卡，我们没有必要变成穴居人

42
00:03:07,464 --&gt; 00:03:08,987
我们只是需要些新衣服

43
00:03:08,987 --&gt; 00:03:12,025
打入敌人内部是最佳的方法

44
00:03:12,448 --&gt; 00:03:14,430
如果我们有了火宗的伪装

45
00:03:14,430 --&gt; 00:03:16,629
那时，在外面就和我们躲在洞中一样安全

46
00:03:16,629 --&gt; 00:03:19,192
好有啊，他们那有真正能吃的东西

47
00:03:19,192 --&gt; 00:03:22,409
有谁还愿意坐在土里吃洞穴蚂蚱吗？

48
00:03:30,300 --&gt; 00:03:32,331
小家伙，你得少数服从多数了

49
00:03:32,567 --&gt; 00:03:33,892
弄新衣服去喽

50
00:03:36,536 --&gt; 00:03:37,824
这样做不好吧

51
00:03:37,824 --&gt; 00:03:39,722
这些衣服都是别人的

52
00:03:39,854 --&gt; 00:03:41,209
那件丝袍我要了

53
00:03:45,634 --&gt; 00:03:47,209
既然这是事关生死的大事

54
00:03:47,464 --&gt; 00:03:48,986
那件套装我要了

55
00:04:02,679 --&gt; 00:04:04,305
嗒哒，普通小孩

56
00:04:05,360 --&gt; 00:04:07,505
嗯，我是应该穿鞋的

57
00:04:07,688 --&gt; 00:04:09,640
不过那样我就啥也看不见了

58
00:04:10,903 --&gt; 00:04:11,936
抱歉了，鞋子

59
00:04:15,915 --&gt; 00:04:19,540
盲御土师的时尚女鞋绚丽登场

60
00:04:19,876 --&gt; 00:04:20,637
我看起来怎么样？

61
00:04:26,396 --&gt; 00:04:27,685
呃，你妈妈的项链

62
00:04:28,403 --&gt; 00:04:29,774
哦，哦，是啊

63
00:04:30,317 --&gt; 00:04:33,077
一看就知道是水族来的，对吧

64
00:04:48,686 --&gt; 00:04:53,054
一百年前，我曾经来这儿拜访过我的朋友 库赞

65
00:04:53,130 --&gt; 00:04:56,120
这儿我熟，听我的指挥，保持镇定

66
00:04:56,120 --&gt; 00:04:58,985
或者按火宗的说法：“别熄火了”

67
00:05:01,574 --&gt; 00:05:03,262
好啊，热血男儿

68
00:05:03,262 --&gt; 00:05:04,538
哦，好

69
00:05:05,960 --&gt; 00:05:06,815
你哪位啊？

70
00:05:09,098 --&gt; 00:05:10,539
哦，咱们这是要去肉铺？

71
00:05:10,539 --&gt; 00:05:13,007
来吧，安昂，这儿的人都吃肉

72
00:05:13,007 --&gt; 00:05:14,184
就连产肉的都吃

73
00:05:17,393 --&gt; 00:05:18,410
你们去吧

74
00:05:18,410 --&gt; 00:05:20,367
我去垃圾中拣几片莴苣好了

75
00:05:25,219 --&gt; 00:05:26,275
热血男儿好，热血男儿好

76
00:05:27,012 --&gt; 00:05:30,377
热血男儿好

77
00:05:31,502 --&gt; 00:05:33,343
你完了，被我们逮到了

78
00:05:33,343 --&gt; 00:05:34,300
说我吗？

79
00:05:34,300 --&gt; 00:05:37,091
再明显不过了，你不应该出现在这儿

80
00:05:38,297 --&gt; 00:05:39,833
下回旷课的话

81
00:05:39,833 --&gt; 00:05:42,246
记着先把校服给脱了

82
00:05:55,574 --&gt; 00:05:59,589
又是一位需要改造思想的学生？

83
00:05:59,589 --&gt; 00:06:01,027
没错

84
00:06:01,027 --&gt; 00:06:02,536
咱们怎么改啊

85
00:06:02,536 --&gt; 00:06:03,788
且慢

86
00:06:03,788 --&gt; 00:06:06,257
你不是火宗人

87
00:06:09,530 --&gt; 00:06:11,903
很明显你是殖民地来的

88
00:06:11,903 --&gt; 00:06:14,753
没错，殖民地，当然喽

89
00:06:14,753 --&gt; 00:06:17,092
我来自土强国的火宗殖民地

90
00:06:18,394 --&gt; 00:06:19,929
你真是太不成规矩了

91
00:06:19,929 --&gt; 00:06:22,779
遇见长者鞠躬行礼是最基本的礼仪

92
00:06:23,943 --&gt; 00:06:25,368
像这样

93
00:06:26,193 --&gt; 00:06:27,040
抱歉，老师

94
00:06:34,021 --&gt; 00:06:36,137
还有在室内不允许带头饰带

95
00:06:36,137 --&gt; 00:06:38,331
呃，我这儿有个疤

96
00:06:38,331 --&gt; 00:06:40,180
让大家看到我会很难堪的

97
00:06:40,180 --&gt; 00:06:41,275
那好吧

98
00:06:41,275 --&gt; 00:06:42,835
报上名来？

99
00:06:42,835 --&gt; 00:06:46,815
否则我们就叫你粗鲁的殖民地懒汉啦

100
00:06:47,520 --&gt; 00:06:49,637
“懒汉”听起来不错

101
00:06:50,480 --&gt; 00:06:52,511
或者，呃，叫我库赞吧

102
00:07:05,322 --&gt; 00:07:06,962
模模，我们终于熬过今天了

103
00:07:06,962 --&gt; 00:07:08,698
今天还挺有趣的

104
00:07:08,698 --&gt; 00:07:11,523
可别让校长发现你带小猴来上学

105
00:07:11,523 --&gt; 00:07:12,328
哪有小猴啊？

106
00:07:12,328 --&gt; 00:07:15,105
别担心，我不会打小报告的

107
00:07:15,105 --&gt; 00:07:16,070
在下 昂吉

108
00:07:16,070 --&gt; 00:07:17,791
对了，我挺喜欢你得头饰带的

109
00:07:19,454 --&gt; 00:07:22,927
昂吉，你没必要给这个新来的当保姆

110
00:07:24,131 --&gt; 00:07:27,314
我听说过你，你是这学校最受欢迎的几个人之一吧

111
00:07:27,314 --&gt; 00:07:28,469
算你有眼光

112
00:07:28,469 --&gt; 00:07:29,559
朋友，你给我听好了

113
00:07:29,559 --&gt; 00:07:30,816
我知道你是从殖民地来的

114
00:07:30,816 --&gt; 00:07:32,546
所以我说得慢点让你听仔细喽

115
00:07:32,546 --&gt; 00:07:35,992
昂吉是我的女朋友

116
00:07:35,992 --&gt; 00:07:37,689
你给我记住了

117
00:07:44,614 --&gt; 00:07:45,827
很高兴见到你

118
00:07:45,860 --&gt; 00:07:47,436
真不敢相信

119
00:07:47,436 --&gt; 00:07:48,708
他居然没扁你

120
00:07:48,708 --&gt; 00:07:50,095
就这么走了

121
00:07:50,095 --&gt; 00:07:51,421
我想是我运气好吧

122
00:07:51,421 --&gt; 00:07:53,737
我们要去玩火宗版捉迷藏

123
00:07:53,737 --&gt; 00:07:54,791
要一起玩吗？

124
00:07:54,791 --&gt; 00:07:56,006
当然啦

125
00:08:03,012 --&gt; 00:08:03,935
你去哪儿啦？

126
00:08:03,935 --&gt; 00:08:05,609
可把我们的担心死了

127
00:08:05,609 --&gt; 00:08:07,728
放学后几个孩子邀我一起玩游戏

128
00:08:09,415 --&gt; 00:08:10,666
什么之后？

129
00:08:11,000 --&gt; 00:08:13,028
我登记了一所火宗学校

130
00:08:13,032 --&gt; 00:08:14,693
明天我还要回去上课

131
00:08:14,693 --&gt; 00:08:16,676
登记了什么？

132
00:08:26,254 --&gt; 00:08:27,374
又是你？

133
00:08:27,487 --&gt; 00:08:28,440
站那儿别动

134
00:08:30,089 --&gt; 00:08:31,825
祖寇殿下？

135
00:08:34,465 --&gt; 00:08:36,340
我要进去探监

136
00:08:36,340 --&gt; 00:08:37,919
你给我乖乖的在这儿放风

137
00:08:37,919 --&gt; 00:08:40,385
要是让别人知道了，你的小命不保

138
00:08:53,629 --&gt; 00:08:56,493
皇叔，是我啊

139
00:09:04,741 --&gt; 00:09:08,365
安昂，我试着理智点，
这回不立即否定你的想法

140
00:09:08,365 --&gt; 00:09:10,842
不过这确实不像个好主意

141
00:09:10,842 --&gt; 00:09:13,051
是啊，我们已经吃穿都有了

142
00:09:13,051 --&gt; 00:09:15,192
你干嘛还要去那个学校？

143
00:09:15,572 --&gt; 00:09:17,186
在那教室的每一分钟

144
00:09:17,186 --&gt; 00:09:19,206
我都会学到关于火宗的新知识

145
00:09:19,206 --&gt; 00:09:21,847
我已经拿到了一张烈火王欧宰的画像

146
00:09:21,847 --&gt; 00:09:24,563
我还用面条做了一幅

147
00:09:24,563 --&gt; 00:09:26,221
我承认，你有点天赋

148
00:09:26,221 --&gt; 00:09:28,001
不过这个计划确实太危险了

149
00:09:28,001 --&gt; 00:09:31,729
那我想咱们不会知道秘河的情报了

150
00:09:31,729 --&gt; 00:09:34,291
据说这条河穿过烈火王的宫殿

151
00:09:34,291 --&gt; 00:09:37,751
我们明天上课就要讲这段内容

152
00:09:37,751 --&gt; 00:09:42,003
嗯，秘河的事一定要搞清楚

153
00:09:43,239 --&gt; 00:09:45,429
好吧，咱们就再逗留数日

154
00:09:45,712 --&gt; 00:09:47,233
沸腾吧，热血男儿

155
00:09:48,879 --&gt; 00:09:51,030
沸腾吧？

156
00:09:54,734 --&gt; 00:09:56,427
你知道的，你这是自作自受

157
00:09:56,427 --&gt; 00:09:58,208
我们本可以一起回来的

158
00:09:58,208 --&gt; 00:09:59,734
你可被视为英雄

159
00:10:01,861 --&gt; 00:10:03,850
皇叔，你没权力评判我

160
00:10:03,850 --&gt; 00:10:06,508
我在永固城作了该做的事情

161
00:10:06,508 --&gt; 00:10:08,518
你居然还敢螳臂当车，真是太蠢了

162
00:10:10,833 --&gt; 00:10:12,110
你就打算这样一言不发吗？

163
00:10:17,789 --&gt; 00:10:19,202
你这个疯老头

164
00:10:19,202 --&gt; 00:10:21,559
你这个疯子，就算你不进监狱

165
00:10:21,559 --&gt; 00:10:22,988
也只配在烂死在贫民窟

166
00:10:29,500 --&gt; 00:10:31,211
同学们，早上好

167
00:10:32,664 --&gt; 00:10:34,743
齐声背诵火宗誓约

168
00:10:36,214 --&gt; 00:10:38,070
我要将毕生奉献给我的国家

169
00:10:38,070 --&gt; 00:10:40,120
我要为烈火王而战哪怕肝脑涂地

170
00:10:40,120 --&gt; 00:10:40,828
烈火王

171
00:10:40,828 --&gt; 00:10:42,505
先辈

172
00:10:42,505 --&gt; 00:10:45,533
我要为把烈火国变得更好而殚精竭虑

173
00:10:45,533 --&gt; 00:10:47,194
我要...

174
00:10:47,194 --&gt; 00:10:48,312
御火师...

175
00:10:48,312 --&gt; 00:10:50,449
烈火王

176
00:10:50,449 --&gt; 00:10:52,396
那个啥，那个啥，那个那个啥

177
00:10:57,258 --&gt; 00:11:01,477
居然敢嘲弄火宗誓约取乐

178
00:11:01,477 --&gt; 00:11:04,479
那咱们就来个关于
我国重大战役的快速小测验吧

179
00:11:07,417 --&gt; 00:11:08,732
第一题

180
00:11:08,732 --&gt; 00:11:12,505
烈火王苏进是在哪年大败气和国军队的？

181
00:11:14,569 --&gt; 00:11:16,144
库赞？

182
00:11:16,144 --&gt; 00:11:18,177
这不是脑筋急转弯吧？

183
00:11:18,177 --&gt; 00:11:21,018
气宗并没有正规军

184
00:11:21,018 --&gt; 00:11:23,783
苏进是靠伏击取胜的

185
00:11:25,652 --&gt; 00:11:29,845
这可不是历时书上记载的内容
你又是怎么知道的？

186
00:11:29,845 --&gt; 00:11:32,166
莫非你去过一百年前

187
00:11:33,338 --&gt; 00:11:35,210
我还是把我的猜想写下来好了

188
00:11:47,358 --&gt; 00:11:48,412
库赞？

189
00:11:50,901 --&gt; 00:11:53,635
我知道我的号吹得很糟糕

190
00:11:53,635 --&gt; 00:11:54,764
吹得还好了，孩子

191
00:11:54,764 --&gt; 00:11:56,846
主要是你脚底发出的噪音太烦人了

192
00:11:56,846 --&gt; 00:11:58,703
难道你有焦虑失调症吗？

193
00:11:59,852 --&gt; 00:12:01,210
我只是在跳舞罢了

194
00:12:01,435 --&gt; 00:12:04,048
你们这里也跳舞的，对吧？

195
00:12:04,048 --&gt; 00:12:05,858
不跳的，没人跳

196
00:12:05,858 --&gt; 00:12:09,959
良好的学习环境之中岂能跳舞

197
00:12:09,959 --&gt; 00:12:13,083
年轻人必须遵守规矩条令

198
00:12:13,083 --&gt; 00:12:15,123
但是要宣泄自己的时候该怎么办？

199
00:12:15,123 --&gt; 00:12:18,855
我知道，有时候我们
总能被自己的爱国情怀所感动

200
00:12:18,855 --&gt; 00:12:21,158
我们的身体将不能自已

201
00:12:22,491 --&gt; 00:12:23,942
如果忍耐不住的话

202
00:12:23,942 --&gt; 00:12:27,424
你可以去僻静的地方自己解决

203
00:12:45,088 --&gt; 00:12:46,010
哦，你好啊，库赞

204
00:12:46,010 --&gt; 00:12:48,528
你那个疯狂舞蹈我挺喜欢的

205
00:12:48,528 --&gt; 00:12:49,489
谢啦，昂吉

206
00:12:49,489 --&gt; 00:12:51,658
如果你不嫌弃的话，我可以给你表演表演

207
00:12:52,756 --&gt; 00:12:54,468
你说啥呢，殖民地垃圾？

208
00:12:54,468 --&gt; 00:12:56,264
你要给她表演啥？

209
00:12:56,264 --&gt; 00:12:57,802
只是几个舞步而已

210
00:12:57,802 --&gt; 00:12:59,883
不允许别人在我的昂吉面前显摆

211
00:12:59,883 --&gt; 00:13:01,752
特别是你的那些破舞步

212
00:13:31,066 --&gt; 00:13:33,426
刚入学第二天就斗殴闹事？

213
00:13:33,426 --&gt; 00:13:36,472
看来我们需要开个碰头会
好好讨论一下对你的处分

214
00:13:36,472 --&gt; 00:13:38,576
放学后叫你的父母来我的办公室

215
00:13:38,576 --&gt; 00:13:40,122
父母，不过

216
00:13:40,122 --&gt; 00:13:41,505
不许迟到

217
00:13:50,314 --&gt; 00:13:51,937
多谢你们能来

218
00:13:51,937 --&gt; 00:13:53,667
怎么称呼？

219
00:13:53,667 --&gt; 00:13:56,406
免贵姓火，火旺

220
00:13:56,406 --&gt; 00:13:58,250
这是内人，塞菲尔

221
00:13:58,267 --&gt; 00:14:01,144
火塞菲尔，幸会

222
00:14:01,144 --&gt; 00:14:03,773
火先生和火太太

223
00:14:04,193 --&gt; 00:14:05,987
令郎才登记入学两天

224
00:14:05,987 --&gt; 00:14:07,724
就到处惹事生非

225
00:14:07,724 --&gt; 00:14:09,597
公开与历史老师争论

226
00:14:09,597 --&gt; 00:14:10,972
在音乐课上捣乱

227
00:14:10,972 --&gt; 00:14:12,844
居然还对优等生动粗

228
00:14:12,844 --&gt; 00:14:14,260
俺的天哪

229
00:14:14,260 --&gt; 00:14:16,034
怎么听起来不像我们的库赞啊

230
00:14:16,034 --&gt; 00:14:18,216
女士，每个当妈的都会这么说的

231
00:14:18,216 --&gt; 00:14:20,374
尽管如此，这次先提出警告

232
00:14:20,374 --&gt; 00:14:22,020
如有再犯

233
00:14:22,020 --&gt; 00:14:24,056
我将会送他去感化学校

234
00:14:24,056 --&gt; 00:14:26,237
说白了就是送去煤矿

235
00:14:26,853 --&gt; 00:14:28,000
明白了吗？

236
00:14:28,000 --&gt; 00:14:30,177
别担心，校长先生

237
00:14:30,177 --&gt; 00:14:33,065
我会严厉管教这个小子的

238
00:14:33,065 --&gt; 00:14:36,931
小子，等回家的
我非揍得你屁股开花不可

239
00:14:36,931 --&gt; 00:14:39,458
这样才像话嘛

240
00:14:45,190 --&gt; 00:14:47,418
橘黄色真是恶心

241
00:14:49,588 --&gt; 00:14:51,584
你愤世嫉俗的时候真美

242
00:14:51,584 --&gt; 00:14:53,307
我可不恨你

243
00:14:53,307 --&gt; 00:14:54,748
我也不恨你

244
00:14:58,344 --&gt; 00:15:00,786
祖寇，能单独跟你谈一下吗？

245
00:15:00,786 --&gt; 00:15:02,583
没看见我正忙着呢吗？

246
00:15:04,787 --&gt; 00:15:08,637
哦，梅，泰丽想让你帮她解辫子

247
00:15:08,637 --&gt; 00:15:11,214
看起来这事挺紧急的

248
00:15:16,691 --&gt; 00:15:20,972
听说你去天牢里探望过肥皇叔了

249
00:15:21,427 --&gt; 00:15:22,687
肯定是那个狱卒告诉你的

250
00:15:22,687 --&gt; 00:15:25,703
不是，是你刚刚告诉我的

251
00:15:26,627 --&gt; 00:15:28,648
算你恨，被你逮到了

252
00:15:28,648 --&gt; 00:15:30,791
阿祖拉，你到底想怎么样？

253
00:15:30,791 --&gt; 00:15:33,329
实际上我别无所求

254
00:15:33,329 --&gt; 00:15:36,080
不管你相不相信，我一直都在罩着你

255
00:15:36,080 --&gt; 00:15:38,611
如果别人知道你去见皇叔了

256
00:15:38,611 --&gt; 00:15:40,271
他们肯定以为你在和他密谋叛乱

257
00:15:40,271 --&gt; 00:15:42,043
要小心点啊，笨笨

258
00:15:47,819 --&gt; 00:15:49,168
就这么定了

259
00:15:49,168 --&gt; 00:15:51,076
小子，不准你再去学校了

260
00:15:52,015 --&gt; 00:15:53,316
我还不想走

261
00:15:53,316 --&gt; 00:15:54,865
我在这儿过得很开心

262
00:15:54,865 --&gt; 00:15:56,625
在这儿我觉得自己就象个普通的小孩一样

263
00:15:56,625 --&gt; 00:15:59,144
索卡，你不会了解我的感受的

264
00:15:59,144 --&gt; 00:16:01,038
你一直都很普通

265
00:16:03,115 --&gt; 00:16:06,442
听着伙计，这些学校里的孩子是烈火国的未来

266
00:16:06,442 --&gt; 00:16:08,871
如果希望改造这个国家

267
00:16:08,871 --&gt; 00:16:11,238
我们需要让他们知道自由的滋味

268
00:16:11,238 --&gt; 00:16:15,132
烈火国满是堕落的小怪物
要改造它谈何容易？

269
00:16:15,132 --&gt; 00:16:18,060
不如我们就从一个秘密舞会开始吧

270
00:16:19,210 --&gt; 00:16:20,743
滚回你的房间去

271
00:16:28,563 --&gt; 00:16:30,801
我们居然真的要办舞会

272
00:16:30,801 --&gt; 00:16:32,939
这简直太傻了

273
00:16:32,939 --&gt; 00:16:34,673
那就别当它是个舞会

274
00:16:34,673 --&gt; 00:16:38,301
就当作是交流曼妙步法
艺术的文化沙龙吧

275
00:16:41,620 --&gt; 00:16:42,611
他们来了

276
00:16:42,611 --&gt; 00:16:44,062
大家都别用御术了

277
00:16:44,801 --&gt; 00:16:46,057
抱歉了，伙计

278
00:16:46,057 --&gt; 00:16:47,994
委屈你去后面等吧

279
00:16:50,594 --&gt; 00:16:53,551
我知道你的脚比任何人都奇特

280
00:16:53,551 --&gt; 00:16:55,013
光是数量上就没人能比

281
00:17:04,548 --&gt; 00:17:06,129
女士们先生们

282
00:17:06,129 --&gt; 00:17:08,301
沸腾吧！

283
00:17:09,610 --&gt; 00:17:11,828
好吧，大家随着节奏动起来吧

284
00:17:15,845 --&gt; 00:17:17,409
现在我们该做什么？

285
00:17:17,409 --&gt; 00:17:19,351
大家开始跳舞吧

286
00:17:20,220 --&gt; 00:17:23,316
我家长肯定不会让我在洞穴中跳舞的

287
00:17:23,316 --&gt; 00:17:26,007
是啊，要是被人发现了该咋办？

288
00:17:27,046 --&gt; 00:17:27,982
哎呀，真是的

289
00:17:27,982 --&gt; 00:17:29,370
听我说，伙计们

290
00:17:29,370 --&gt; 00:17:31,602
舞蹈并不是你们想象的那样

291
00:17:31,602 --&gt; 00:17:33,140
只是一种自我宣泄的方式

292
00:17:33,140 --&gt; 00:17:35,756
没人可以将它从你身上夺走的

293
00:17:35,756 --&gt; 00:17:39,512
库赞，肯能你们殖民地与这儿不同
我们这儿不兴这个

294
00:17:39,512 --&gt; 00:17:40,685
谁说的

295
00:17:40,685 --&gt; 00:17:42,273
你们的舞蹈历史也是相当悠久

296
00:17:42,273 --&gt; 00:17:45,930
我都晓得几种经典的火宗舞蹈

297
00:17:45,930 --&gt; 00:17:47,469
一百年前

298
00:17:47,469 --&gt; 00:17:49,218
这种“凤翔舞”相当流行

299
00:17:52,843 --&gt; 00:17:55,645
这种舞步叫“驼象阔步”

300
00:18:03,275 --&gt; 00:18:05,489
没想到“亮脚趾”还真有两下子

301
00:18:10,418 --&gt; 00:18:11,886
我给你带来了点巨蜥鸡肉

302
00:18:11,886 --&gt; 00:18:14,041
你可能并不喜欢

303
00:18:14,041 --&gt; 00:18:16,038
不过这肯定比监狱的伙食强多了

304
00:18:16,038 --&gt; 00:18:17,445
我承认

305
00:18:17,445 --&gt; 00:18:19,580
我得到了我一直梦想的一切

306
00:18:19,580 --&gt; 00:18:22,268
不过并不全像我想要的那样

307
00:18:23,745 --&gt; 00:18:24,997
事实上

308
00:18:24,997 --&gt; 00:18:27,029
我需要您的建议

309
00:18:27,029 --&gt; 00:18:30,028
我认为降世神通仍然活着

310
00:18:30,028 --&gt; 00:18:32,053
他一定隐匿在某处

311
00:18:32,053 --&gt; 00:18:33,529
我已经失去理智了

312
00:18:33,529 --&gt; 00:18:38,278
求你了，皇叔，我太困惑了
急需你的帮助

313
00:18:40,834 --&gt; 00:18:41,939
算了

314
00:18:41,939 --&gt; 00:18:43,242
我会自己解决的

315
00:18:43,242 --&gt; 00:18:45,237
从此你是生是死都与我无关

316
00:19:04,149 --&gt; 00:19:06,700
这是永固城的舞厅中流行的舞步

317
00:19:12,770 --&gt; 00:19:14,878
哇哦，他俩看起来好配啊

318
00:19:14,878 --&gt; 00:19:16,748
呃，只有你是这么认为吧

319
00:19:19,833 --&gt; 00:19:21,316
对，就是这样

320
00:19:21,316 --&gt; 00:19:22,914
这就是欢快舞步的声音

321
00:19:28,183 --&gt; 00:19:29,547
好的，跟着节奏

322
00:19:29,547 --&gt; 00:19:31,134
大家自由的跳吧

323
00:19:48,740 --&gt; 00:19:50,172
安昂，不好吧

324
00:19:50,172 --&gt; 00:19:52,430
我这双鞋不适合跳舞

325
00:19:52,430 --&gt; 00:19:54,628
再说我也不确定我是否...

326
00:19:54,628 --&gt; 00:19:55,421
拉住我的手

327
00:19:55,421 --&gt; 00:19:56,998
好吧

328
00:20:18,000 --&gt; 00:20:19,912
安昂，大家都看着呢

329
00:20:20,363 --&gt; 00:20:21,282
别管他们

330
00:20:21,282 --&gt; 00:20:23,969
现在这里就只有我和你

331
00:21:07,635 --&gt; 00:21:09,784
的确是个舞会

332
00:21:09,784 --&gt; 00:21:12,130
海德，做的好，幸亏你向我报告了

333
00:21:12,130 --&gt; 00:21:14,140
校长，随时听您的指示

334
00:21:16,370 --&gt; 00:21:17,506
真是太不可思议了

335
00:21:17,506 --&gt; 00:21:19,913
好像我的压抑感都瞬间消失了

336
00:21:24,715 --&gt; 00:21:27,467
哦，他们又回来了

337
00:21:27,467 --&gt; 00:21:29,970
咱们要找的就是他

338
00:21:29,970 --&gt; 00:21:31,258
抓住那个带头饰带的男孩

339
00:21:39,542 --&gt; 00:21:40,347
抓到你了

340
00:21:40,347 --&gt; 00:21:41,316
在找我吗？

341
00:21:43,193 --&gt; 00:21:44,713
不是他

342
00:21:44,713 --&gt; 00:21:46,258
他肯定在这儿

343
00:21:46,258 --&gt; 00:21:47,758
别让他跑了

344
00:21:52,594 --&gt; 00:21:53,386
啥事？

345
00:21:58,343 --&gt; 00:22:00,031
你好啊，瞧我们咋样？

346
00:22:07,608 --&gt; 00:22:08,849
在找人吗？

347
00:22:10,958 --&gt; 00:22:11,883
你们在找谁啊？

348
00:22:11,883 --&gt; 00:22:13,036
用帮忙吗？

349
00:22:13,036 --&gt; 00:22:14,066
在这儿呢

350
00:22:29,100 --&gt; 00:22:30,093
给我停下

351
00:22:31,208 --&gt; 00:22:32,125
你也是

352
00:22:35,334 --&gt; 00:22:36,590
我们安全了，索卡

353
00:22:36,590 --&gt; 00:22:38,275
你现在可以把假胡子摘了

354
00:22:38,275 --&gt; 00:22:39,953
哦，不，我摘不下来了

355
00:22:39,953 --&gt; 00:22:42,446
好像这胡子已经长上了

356
00:22:42,446 --&gt; 00:22:44,567
好样的，舞神

357
00:22:44,567 --&gt; 00:22:47,266
我想你真的帮到了这些孩子

358
00:22:47,266 --&gt; 00:22:49,192
你教会了他们什么是自由

359
00:22:49,192 --&gt; 00:22:50,147
是吗

360
00:22:50,147 --&gt; 00:22:52,090
我只是办了个舞会而已

361
00:22:52,090 --&gt; 00:22:55,105
安昂，那个舞会真的很赞

362
00:22:57,843 --&gt; 00:22:59,325
沸腾吧，兄弟

363
00:22:59,325 --&gt; 00:23:00,904
沸腾吧

364
00:23:15,168 --&gt; 00:23:16,601
确定没人跟踪你吧？

365
00:23:16,601 --&gt; 00:23:18,437
我听说过你

366
00:23:18,437 --&gt; 00:23:20,922
据说你很专业

367
00:23:20,922 --&gt; 00:23:23,379
也很会保守秘密

368
00:23:23,379 --&gt; 00:23:25,455
神通还活着

369
00:23:26,419 --&gt; 00:23:27,989
我要你找到他

370
00:23:27,989 --&gt; 00:23:29,777
送他上西天

371
00:23:29,939 --&gt; 00:23:39,782

很久以前

6
00:00:12,243 --&gt; 00:00:14,911
这四大国和谐共处

7
00:00:15,013 --&gt; 00:00:19,182
然而，烈火国发起的战争结束了和平

8
00:00:19,283 --&gt; 00:00:23,387
只有同时掌握四种元素的降世神通才能结束战争

9
00:00:23,488 --&gt; 00:00:25,222
然而在大家最需要他的时候

10
00:00:25,323 --&gt; 00:00:27,190
他却消失了

11
00:00:27,291 --&gt; 00:00:30,961
100年后，我和哥哥发现了转世的降世神通

12
00:00:31,062 --&gt; 00:00:32,796
他是个御气师，名叫“安昂”

13
00:00:32,897 --&gt; 00:00:35,132
尽管他的御气术着实厉害

14
00:00:35,233 --&gt; 00:00:38,368
在拯救苍生之前，他要学的还有很多

15
00:00:38,469 --&gt; 00:00:42,139
但是我坚信 安昂能拯救这个世界

那入侵计划该如何实行？

19
00:00:51,883 --&gt; 00:00:56,353
我们将在日食日与我父亲以及其他义军会合

20
00:00:56,454 --&gt; 00:00:58,388
小声点

21
00:00:58,489 --&gt; 00:01:01,191
这里可是敌人的领地

22
00:01:01,292 --&gt; 00:01:04,194
我们需要的只是几件新衣服

23
00:01:04,295 --&gt; 00:01:06,496
没错，打入敌人内部是最佳的方法

24
00:01:06,597 --&gt; 00:01:08,365
如果我们有了火宗的伪装

25
00:01:08,466 --&gt; 00:01:11,301
在外面就和我们躲在洞中一样安全

26
00:01:11,402 --&gt; 00:01:13,603
嗒哒，普通小孩

27
00:01:13,705 --&gt; 00:01:15,439
