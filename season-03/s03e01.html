[Introduction Sequence]

[&quot;Previously on Avatar&quot; sequence, including clips from Crossroads of
Destiny]

Act I

(The episode opens with a shot of Aang asleep. Aang begins to awaken as
the camera zooms out. He sits up and groans. Bandages cover his arms and
abdomen. Cut to Aang&#x27;s p.o.v. He stares at the floor, his vision blurry
and his head swaying. Cut back to Aang sitting on his bed.)

Aang: (clutching his stomach) What happened?

(Aang looks to the side and the camera zooms out to reveal that he is
inside a room on a Fire Nation ship. The camera cuts to a banner on the
wall, then to Aang looking shocked. Aang turns around and sees the large
tapestry with the Fire Nation insignia hanging on the wall behind him.)

Aang: Oh no!

(Aang scrambles off the bed. Cut to a shot of the room&#x27;s door. The metal
latch squeaks as Aang opens it and peers outside. Aang slowly hobbles down
it the dimly lit hallway, teetering from side to side while using his
staff and the wall for support. Cut to a shot of Aang coming to a corner.
He looks around it and sees two Fire Nation soldiers, one very tall and
carrying a club, and the other very tiny.)

Tall Fire Nation Soldier: You hear something?

(Aang gasps and puts his back to the wall before turning the corner and
swinging his staff and bending a strong gust of wind at the soldiers. The
soldiers shield themselves from the attack and Aang runs down the
corridor.)

Tall Fire Nation Soldier: He&#x27;s awake!

(Cut to a shot of Aang desperately trying to get away from the soldiers,
still using his staff for support. The soldiers round the corner and
follow after him.)

Tall Fire Nation Soldier: Stop, wait!

(Aang tries to escape, looking back at the soldiers. He comes to a small
flight of stairs leading to the deck and climbs up. Aang tries to jump off
the steps and onto the deck. Cut to a shot from the deck of Aang falling
down. He loses his grip on his staff and it slides across the deck. The
dark sky indicates that it is night. Cut to a shot of the staff. The
camera follows it as it slides and comes to a stop in front of Hakoda,
Bato, and Momo. Hakoda and Bato are dressed as Fire Nation soldiers and
Momo is having his chin scratched by Hakoda. They look down at the staff.
Cut to Aang, who has a surprised look on his face.)

Aang: (confused) Momo?

(Cut back to Momo, Hakoda, and Bato as they all turn and look at Aang.
Momo chirps happily and leaps towards the camera. Aang picks himself off
the floor as Momo jumps on to Aang&#x27;s shoulders and licks his cheek.)

Toph: (off screen) Twinkle-Toes, that&#x27;s got to be you.

(Cut to a shot of Toph and Katara running towards Aang excitedly. Cut to a
shot behind Aang, the camera positioned over his shoulders. Standing in
front of Aang are Hakoda, Bato, and a shorter Fire Nation soldier wearing
firebender armor. Toph, Katara, and the tiny Fire Nation soldier, who is
The Duke, walk on camera from the right, while the tall Fire Nation
soldier, who is actually Pipsqueak, runs in from the left.)

Katara: Aang, you&#x27;re awake!
Aang: Are you sure? (rubs his eyes) I feel like I&#x27;m dreaming.

(Aang is caught off guard when Katara runs up and embraces him.)

Katara: You&#x27;re not dreaming. You&#x27;re finally awake.

(Katara lets go and the person dressed as a Fire Nation soldier walks up
to Aang and gives him a quick hug.)

Sokka: Aang, good to see you back with the living, buddy.
Aang: (confused) Sokka?

(Cut to a close up of Aang looking very exhausted and confused. The camera
rotates around him as he begins to faint.)

Toph: Uh-oh! Somebody catch him, he&#x27;s gonna...

(Katara runs to catch Aang, but he falls. The camera turns up towards the
night sky and fades to black at the sound of Aang hitting the deck.)

Aang: Ughh.

(Cut to an overhead shot of the deck. All of Aang&#x27;s friends are gathered
around him. Appa walks in from off screen and groans softly. Cut to a shot
of the entire port side of the Fire Nation ship as it rushes through the
sea past the mountain on the other side. The shot fades into a similar
shot of a royal Fire Nation ship in the open ocean. Cut to a shot of Zuko,
his back to the camera, standing at the edge of the deck. The moon shines
brightly through the clouds. Cut to a close up of Zuko.)

Mai: (walking onscreen) Aren&#x27;t you cold?
Zuko: I&#x27;ve got a lot on my mind. It&#x27;s been so long. Over three years since
I was home. I wonder what&#x27;s changed. I wonder how I&#x27;ve changed.
Mai: (sighs) I just asked if you were cold. I didn&#x27;t ask for your whole
life story. (smiles and wraps her arms around Zuko) Stop worrying.

(Mai pulls Zuko&#x27;s face closer. Cut to a very close shot of Zuko and Mai
sharing a kiss. Mai lets go of Zuko and walks off screen. Cut to a close
up of Zuko&#x27;s closed eyes. The camera zooms in as he slowly opens them. The
scene cuts to an overhead shot of the Fire Nation ship that Aang and his
friends are on.)

Aang: (off screen) Why are we on a Fire Nation ship? Why is everyone
dressed this way? And why am I the only one out of it?

(Cut to a shot of Aang and Katara sitting on the deck in front of Appa.
Aang is given a red robe by someone is disguise.)

Katara: You need to take it easy, o.k? You got hurt pretty bad. I like
your hair.
Aang: (shocked and feeling his scalp) I have hair? How long was I out?
Katara: A few weeks.

(Hakoda enters the shot of Katara.)

Hakoda: Everything ok?
Katara: (looking away) We&#x27;re fine, Dad.
Hakoda: (offering Aang his hand) I&#x27;m Hakoda, Katara and Sokka&#x27;s father.
Katara: (annoyed) He knows who you are. I just called you &quot;Dad&quot;, didn&#x27;t I?

Hakoda: I guess you&#x27;re right.
Aang: Nice to officially meet you, Chief Hakoda (offers his hand).
Hakoda: (grabs Aang&#x27;s arm) It&#x27;s an honor to meet you.
Katara: (annoyed) Great, great. Now you guys have finally met, so would
you mind giving us a little privacy?
Hakoda: Of course.

(Hakoda walks off. Cut to a shot of Aang and Katara and the foreground.
Hakoda is seen in the background petting Appa.)

Aang: Are you made at your dad or something?
Katara: What? Not at all, why would you say that?
Aang: Mmm-emmm (shrugs, but almost immediately groans and holds his side
in pain).
Katara: Maybe we should go upstairs. You need a healing session.

(Katara helps Aang to his feet. Fade to a shot of the back of Aang&#x27;s head.
He and Katara and back in his room. The camera points down Aang&#x27;s back and
focuses on the scar left by Azula&#x27;s lightning. Cut to a shot in front of
Aang sitting cross legged on a short platform. Katara is standing behind
him and bends the water out of two bowls on either side of Aang and places
the water onto his wound.)

Katara: Tell me where your pain feels most intense.

(Aang&#x27;s eyes are squeezed shut and he gives a soft grunt of pain.)

Aang: A little higher.

(The camera quickly zooms in on Aang&#x27;s eye. The screen flashes and we see
a short flashback of Aang entering the Avatar state during &quot;The Crossroads
of Destiny&quot;. Cut back to Aang&#x27;s eye, then cut to a shot of Katara moving
the healing water over Aang&#x27;s back and shoulders.)

Aang: Wow, you are definitely in the right area there.
Katara: I can feel a lot of energy twisted up around there. Let me just
see if I can...

(Katara pulls the healing water up and away from Aang&#x27;s scar. Aang arches
his back painfully and the screen flashes before cutting to a flashback of
Aang being hit by lightning in the Avatar state then Katara holding Aang&#x27;s
body on Appa. The flashback fades to white and the scene shifts back to a
profile shot of Aang recovering from the shock.)

Aang: I went down! I didn&#x27;t just get hurt, did I? It was worse than that.
I was gone. But you brought me back.
Katara: I just used the spirit water from the North Pole. I don&#x27;t know
what I did, exactly.
Aang: You saved me.
Katara: (places a hand on Aang&#x27;s cheek) You need to rest.

(The camera zooms out from the shot of Aang and Katara. The scene cuts to
a shot of the Fire Nation capital city and harbor. Cut to Lo and Li, who
are seated on top of a very high balcony at the royal plaza facing a large
crowd of Fire Nation citizens. Behind them is a large archway filled with
flames.)

Li and Lo: Your Princess Azula, clever and beautiful, disguised herself as
the enemy and entered the Earth Kingdom&#x27;s capital. In Ba Sing Se she found
her brother, Zuko, and together, they faced the Avatar. And the Avatar
fell, and the Earth Kingdom fell.

(The screen flashes white and the scene changes to a flashback of the Dai
Li standing at the top of Ba Sing Se&#x27;s outer wall)

Li and Lo: (voice over) Azula&#x27;s agents quickly overtook the entire city.
They went to Ba Sing Se&#x27;s Great Walls, and brought them down!

(The Dai Li jump off and begin sliding down the die of the wall, using
earthbending to weaken it. The Dai Li agents land on the ground and spring
forward, slamming their gloved fists into the wall and causing a large
section of it to collapse.)

Lo and Li: (voice over) The armies of the Fire Nation surged through the
wall and swarmed over Ba Sing Se, securing our victory.

(Cut to a shot of Fire Nation soldiers marching past the tea shop in the
outer ring. Cut to a shot of Pao peeking through the doorway and chewing

begin to cry and Than pulls them closer. Cut to a shot of Fire Nation
tanks driving up to the Earth King&#x27;s palace. The scene fades to white and
flashes back to a shot of Lo and Li.)

Li and Lo: Now the heroes have returned home. Your princess, Azula!

(Cut to a profile shot of Azula. The camera pans right as she walks
towards the edge of the balcony and the crowd cheers for her.)

Li and Lo: And after three long years, your prince has returned. Zuko!

(Cut to Zuko walking out onto the balcony and facing the crowd. The Fire
Nation citizens cheer for him as he sullenly gazing over the crowd. The
scene shifts to the Fire Nation ship gliding through the water. Cut to a
shot of Sokka sitting on top of a crate on the deck, surrounded by the
rest of his friends and family. They are all eating bowls of noodles.)

Sokka: After what happened in Ba Sing Se, we had to get you to safety.

(The scene flashes back to a shot of Appa flying away from Ba Sing Se.)

Sokka: (voice over) We flew back to Chameleon Bay, where we found my
father and the other Water Tribe men.

(Cut to shot of Appa flying over Chameleon Bay. The camera turns right as
Appa flies over a fleet of Water Tribe ships.)

Sokka: (voice over) The Earth King decided he wanted to travel the world
in disguise, so he set off alone.

(Cut to a shot of the Earth King smiling rising up into the camera&#x27;s view.
The camera quickly zooms out as he removes his hat and formal garb,
revealing nomad clothes underneath.)

Sokka: (voice over) Well, not completely alone.

(Bosco walks on screen from the right and rips off clothes. The Earth King
waves goodbye before climbing on Bosco&#x27;s back and riding off.)

Sokka: (voice over) Soon, the bay was overrun with Fire Nation ships.
Rather than fight them all, we captured a single ship and made it our
disguise.

(Cut to a shot of two small Water Tribe canoes sneaking up on a Fire
Nation ship at night. Cut to three Water Tribe warriors wearing masks
climbing on board the Fire Nation ship. The scene fades to white and
flashes back to a close up of a map of the northern Earth Kingdom.)

Sokka: (off screen) Since then, we&#x27;ve been traveling west (points to
Chameleon Bay and moves his finger across The Serpent&#x27;s Pass). We crossed
through The Serpent&#x27;s Pass a few days ago. We&#x27;ve seen a few Fire Nation
ships, but none have bothered us.
Aang: So, what now?
Hakoda: We&#x27;ve been working on a modified version of the invasion plan.
Katara: (annoyed) It&#x27;s Sokka&#x27;s invasion plan.
Hakoda: Yes, Sokka&#x27;s plan. We won&#x27;t be able to mount a massive invasion
without the Earth King&#x27;s armies, but the solar eclipse will still leave
the Fire Nation vulnerable.
Sokka: So we&#x27;re planning a smaller invasion. Just a ragtag team of our
friends and allies from around the Earth Kingdom. We already ran into
Pipsqueak and The Duke.

(Cut to a shot of Pipsqueak with The Duke seated on his shoulders. Both
are eating.)

Pipsqueak: Good to see you again, Aang.
Sokka: And the best part is, the eclipse isn&#x27;t even our biggest advantage.
(whispering) We have a secret (looks left and right). You!
Aang: Me?
Sokka: Yep, the whole world thinks you&#x27;re dead! (stands up and raises his
arms triumphantly) Isn&#x27;t that great?!

(Cut to a close up of Aang. Shock is plastered on his face as the camera
zooms in. Cut to commercial.)

Act II

(The show returns to an overhead shot of the stolen Fire Nation ship
moving towards an island in the distance. Cut to Aang looking over the
side of the ship and looking shocked.)

Aang: The world thinks I&#x27;m dead? How is that good news? That&#x27;s terrible!
Sokka: No, it&#x27;s great. It means the Fire Nation won&#x27;t be hunting us
anymore. And even better, they won&#x27;t expect you on The Day of Black Sun.
Aang: No, no, no, no, no. You have no idea. This is so messed up!

(The horn of another ship blares. The camera pans left as Sokka looks
over. Cut to a shot of another Fire Nation ship approaching up ahead. Cut
back to Aang.)

Aang: I&#x27;ll handle this. The Avatar is back!

(Aang grabs his glider staff and slams it on the floor, opening its wings,
but it causes him to flinch in pain and clutch his side. Bearing through
it, Aang grabs the glider&#x27;s wings and prepares to take off. Cut to an
overhead shot of the group.)

Katara: Aang, wait. Remember, they don&#x27;t know we&#x27;re not Fire Nation.

(Cut back to Aang. Sweating heavily, he reluctantly folds his glider up.
Cut to Hakoda and Bato.)

Hakoda: Everyone just stay calm. Bato and I will take care of this.

(Bato and Hakoda don their Fire Nation helmets. Cut to Pipsqueak lifting
up The Duke, who is wrapped in a large piece of tarp. He throws The Duke
over Appa, who is sitting in a cargo pit, letting the tarp unravel and
cover the flying Bison. Momo jumps into the pit with Appa. Cut to a shot
of Aang and Toph crouching inside the stairway leading below the deck.
Katara and Sokka join them.)

Aang: (whispering) I hate not being able to do anything.
Toph: Hopefully, you won&#x27;t need to.

(Cut to an overhead shot of the ships stopping parallel to each other. A
bridge lowers across the gap between the two. Cut to a close up of a Fire
Nation officer crossing the ship. Two Fire Nation soldiers follow closely
behind. Cut to the officer&#x27;s p.o.v. as he walks up to Bato and Hakoda, who
glance at each other. Cut to a shot of the officer setting foot on the
ship. Hakoda bows to the officer.)

Fire Nation Officer: Commander, why are you off course? All Western Fleet
ships are supposed to be moving toward Ba Sing Se to support the
occupation.
Hakoda: Actually, we&#x27;re from the Eastern Fleet. We have orders to deliver
some cargo.
Fire Nation Officer: Ah, Eastern Fleet. Well, nice of Admiral Chan to let
us know he was sending one of his ships our way.
Bato: I am sure Admiral Chan meant no disrespect, sir.
Fire Nation Officer: I mean, how hard is it to write a quick note and send
a hawk our way?
Hakoda: Next time, we&#x27;ll send two hawks to be sure you get the message.

(Hakoda and the officer bow to each other before Bato and Hakoda walk off.
Cut to a close up of the officer and the two soldiers.)

Fire Nation Soldier: Sir, Admiral Chan has been on leave for two months at
Ember Island.
Fire Nation Officer: What? Why doesn&#x27;t anyone ever tell me anything?
Something&#x27;s not right. They should&#x27;ve known that. I think this is a
captured ship. (whispering) Just stay quiet until we&#x27;re safely across the
ramp. Then we&#x27;ll sink this ship!

(The officer and the soldiers begin to walk back across the bridge. The
camera tilts down to show Toph listening to the officer and then looking
shocked when she hears his last sentence. Toph climbs out of the stairway
and pointing at the officer.)

Toph: They know!

(Toph thrusts her hand towards the floor. Cut to a close up of Toph&#x27;s hand
grabbing the metal and twisting it. The camera tilts up as Toph bends a
fissure in the metal leading all the way up to the bridge. The bridge
buckles, and the officer and the soldiers lose their balance just as the
bridge falls out from underneath them. Cut to a downward shot of the
bridge, soldiers, and officer, yelling in fear, falling into the water
below. Cut to a close up of Katara. The camera zooms out as she bends a
small mountain of water up between the ships. She turns in a circle and
thrusts her arms forward. The water slams into the side of the other ship,
knocking it back several yards. Cut to a shot of the water washing onto
the enemy ship&#x27;s deck, and then quickly cut to an overhead shot of the two
ships. The stolen Fire Nation ship begins to make its escape. Cut to a
shot at the water&#x27;s level of a rope ladder being tossed over the side of
the Fire Nation ship to the officer and the soldiers floating in the sea,

shadow passes over the turtle ducks, scaring them off. Cut to a shot of
Azula standing in front of Zuko with the turtle ducks swimming off screen
and quacking in fright.)

Azula: You seem so downcast. Has Mai gotten to you already? Though
actually, Mai has been in a strangely good mood lately.
Zuko: I haven&#x27;t seen Dad yet. I haven&#x27;t seen him in three years, since I
was banished.
Azula: So what?
Zuko: So, I didn&#x27;t capture the Avatar.
Azula: (gesturing) Who cares? The Avatar&#x27;s dead. Unless you think he
somehow miraculously survived.

(Zuko looks down and away from Azula. The screen flashes white and the
scene cuts to a flashback of Katara holding the spirit oasis water during
&quot;The Crossroads of Destiny&quot;.)

Katara: This is water from the Spirit Oasis, at the North Pole. It has
special properties, so I&#x27;ve been saving it for something important.

(The screen flashes white and the scene shifts back to the present.)

Zuko: No. There&#x27;s no way he could&#x27;ve survived.

(Cut to and zoom in on Azula staring Zuko down, and then to Zuko matching
Azula with a glare. Cut to a shot of Azula from over Zuko&#x27;s shoulder.)

Azula: Well, then I&#x27;m sure you have nothing to worry about.

(Azula leaves, exiting off screen. The scene shifts to a close up of a
fire bender moving onto screen. The camera quickly zooms out as he ignites
an oil covered rock loaded onto a trebuchet. The trebuchet is fired and
the camera tilts up as the flaming ammo is flung into the air towards the
stolen Fire Nation ship. Cut to a shot of the ignited boulder hitting the
water, just missing the stolen ship. Cut to a wide, overhead shot of the
Fire Nation ship firing again at the stolen ship. Cut back to the side of

Toph: Load the Toph!

(Cut to a shot of Pipsqueak heaving a big stone disc over his head. He
sets the disc in front of Toph. Cut to a shot of Toph&#x27;s feet. The camera
pans right as she takes two steps forward, slamming her left foot into the
floor and popping the disc into the air in front of her. The camera zooms
in on Toph just as she turns and shoves the stone disc with her palms,
shooting it at the enemy ship. Cut to a shot of the stone disc flying
across the water towards the Fire Nation ship. It hits the trebuchet,
demolishing it. The camera quickly pans over to another trebuchet being
fired. Cut back to Toph launching another disc. Cut to a wide shot between
the two ships. The flaming boulder and the stone disc collide in the air
and explode.

Cut to Aang and Sokka hiding inside the hall leading to the bridge, both
on either side of the doorway leading out to the deck. Outside, a fireball
can be seen hitting the water and causing a big splash. Aang attempts to
run out and help in the battle, but Sokka grabs his shoulders and shakes
his head, stopping Aang. Aang goes back to his hiding spot and knocks his
head against his staff in frustration. Cut to a shot of a ballista on the
enemy Fire Nation ship pointing downwards and firing. The chained, metal
projectile shoots into the water and punctures the hull of the stolen
ship. Cut to a shot of the inside of the hull being pierced by the
projectile, causing a huge leak. Cut to a shot of the puncture from the
outside as water begins to rush in. The chain connected to the projectile

ships. Cut to a close up of the water&#x27;s surface. A cloud of mist forms and
rises up. Cut to a shot behind Katara as she lifts her arms up and bends a
huge cloud of mist into the air. She pushes her arms out, making the mist
float behind the stolen ship, clouding the view. Cut to a wide overhead
shot of the mist engulfing both ships. Cut to Toph, The Duke, Bato and
Hakoda on deck. The all run when a fireball pierces through the mist. Cut

disc he is holding and runs away just before the fireball smashes into the
pile of discs. Cut to Aang and Sokka who are still hiding. They are both
shaken by the last attack as the debris and smoke fly past the doorway.)

Aang: I can&#x27;t just stand by and do nothing!

(Aang rushes outside.)

Sokka: Aang! No!

(Cut to a close up of Sokka&#x27;s hand grabbing Aang&#x27;s staff. Quickly zoom out
to a shot of Aang and Sokka.)

Sokka: You&#x27;re still hurt, and you have to stay secret. Just let us handle
this.
Aang: Fine!

(Aang angrily snatches his staff away from Sokka and storms off screen.
There is another explosion and Sokka is caught in a wave of smoke. Cut to
a wide overhead shot of the ships exiting the mist cloud. Another fireball

Toph: How we doing?
Sokka: Things couldn&#x27;t get much worse.

(Suddenly, the giant serpent from The Serpent&#x27;s Pass bursts from the water

ship and screeching. Cut to Sokka, Toph, and The Duke.)

Sokka: The Universe just loves proving me wrong, doesn&#x27;t it?
Toph: You make it so easy!

(Cut to a shot of the serpent towering over the ship. It is about the
strike when a fireball from the enemy ship strikes it in the head. Cut to
a close up of the serpent, showing a charred mark where the fireball hit.
The camera zooms out to a wide shot of both ships and the serpent in the
background. The serpent dives into the water. Cut to an overhead panning

(Cut to a close up of Aang&#x27;s stomach. He clutches it as it growls and the
camera tilts up to his face.)

Aang: Well, I am pretty hungry. Maybe dinner&#x27;s a good idea.
Sokka: (pulls out a red headband) Here, tie this around your head. It&#x27;ll
cover your arrow.
Aang: I&#x27;m not going out if I can&#x27;t wear my arrow proudly.
Sokka: Aang, be practical.
Katara: You guys go ahead without us. We&#x27;ll catch up with you.

(Sokka and Toph leave the room. Cut to a shot of Aang laying on his bed
and tapping his finger.)

Katara: I think I understand why being a secret bothers you so much.
(places a hand on Aang&#x27;s shoulder The camera tilts up to Katara) You don&#x27;t
want people to think you failed.
Aang: You&#x27;re right, I don&#x27;t. But the problem is, I did fail.
Katara: Aang, that&#x27;s not true.
Aang: It is true. I was in Ba Sing Se. I was there, but I lost. And now,
the Earth Kingdom has fallen for good.
Katara: Remember, there&#x27;s still an invasion plan.
Aang: (angry) And I hate the invasion plan, too! I don&#x27;t want you or
anyone else risking your lives to fix my mistakes. (grabs the tapestry
above his bed and rips it off its hanger, throwing it to the floor and
knocking over his staff) I&#x27;ve always known that I would have to face the
Fire Lord, but now, I know I need to do it alone.
Katara: Aang.
Aang: Katara, please. Just go, please.

(Cut to a shot of Katara. She tilts her head down sadly and makes her way
to the door.)

curtain with a gold symbol of the Fire Nation on it. Zuko takes a deep
breath, braces himself and walks forward, parting the curtain. The camera
zooms in, revealing the Fire Lord&#x27;s throne room. The throne room is filled
with dark, ornate pillars. Fire Lord Ozai sits on his throne up on the
dais, separated from the rest of the throne room by a trench of fire. Cut

(Bato walks off screen and Katara walks up to Hakoda.)

Hakoda: What&#x27;s wrong Katara?
Katara: He left.
Hakoda: What?
Katara: (frustrated) Aang. He just took his glider and disappeared. He has
this ridiculous notion that he has to save the world alone. That it&#x27;s all
his responsibility.
Hakoda: Maybe that&#x27;s his way of being brave.
Katara: (angry) It&#x27;s not brave. It&#x27;s selfish and stupid. We could be
helping him. And I know the world needs him, but doesn&#x27;t he know how much
that we need him too? How could he just leave us behind?

(There is a brief moment of silence as Hakoda lets Katara&#x27;s words sink in)

Hakoda: You&#x27;re talking about me too, aren&#x27;t you?
Katara: (crying) How could you leave us, Dad? I mean, I know we had Gran
Gran, and she loved us, but...but we were just so lost without you.

(Katara turns away and sobs. Hakoda puts a hand on her shoulder.

Hakoda: I am so sorry, Katara.

(Katara hugs Hakoda and continues to cry into his chest. Hakoda returns
the embrace.)

Katara: (crying) I understand why you left. I really do, and I know that
you had to go, so why do I still feel this way? I was so sad and angry,
and hurt.
Hakoda: I love you more than anything. You and your brother are my entire
world. I thought about you every day I was gone, and every night when I
went to sleep. I would lay awake missing you so much, it would ache.

(Cut to a close up of Hakoda. The camera tilts down to Katara, tears
running down her cheeks, before the scene cuts to the Fire Lord&#x27;s throne
room. Zuko kneels on the floor before as he paces to the left.)

Ozai: I am proud of you, Prince Zuko. I am proud because your sister
conquered Ba Sing Se. I am proud because, when your loyalty was tested by
your treacherous uncle, you did the right thing, and captured the traitor.
And I am proudest of all of your most legendary accomplishment. You slayed
the Avatar.

(Cut to a profile shot of Ozai as he walks around behind Zuko. The camera
tilts down to Zuko as he raises his eyebrow in surprise.)

sealguanas. Cut to a shot of Aang popping out of the water on the other
side. He catches his breath and is clearly exhausted. Aang spots a large
peace of drift wood and swims over to it. Aang grabs on to it and smiles
as an idea comes into his head. Cut to a quick zooming out shot of Aang
windsurfing, using the driftwood as a board and his glider staff as a sail
and bouncing over the waves. Fade to another shot of Aang wind surfing,
but now it is raining heavily. Aang struggles to hang on as the board
bounces high into the air. Aang hits the water, but wipes out. He
disappears into the waves and the glider staff towards the camera just
before cutting to a tilting up shot of the Fire Nation royal palace. Cut
to a shot of Azula lying in her bed. The door opens and the light shines
in, casting Zuko&#x27;s shadow over Azula.)

Zuko: Why&#x27;d you do it?
Azula: (eyes closed) You&#x27;re going to have to be a little more specific.
Zuko: Why did you tell Father That I was the one who killed the Avatar?
Azula: Can&#x27;t this wait until morning?
Zuko: (sternly) It can&#x27;t
Azula: (Sighs, opens her eyes and sits up) Fine. You seemed so worried
about how father would treat you because you hadn&#x27;t captured the Avatar. I
figured, if I gave you the credit, you&#x27;d have nothing to worry about.
Zuko: But why?
Azula: (gets out of bed) Call it a generous gesture. I wanted to thank you
for your help, and I was happy to share the glory.
Zuko: You&#x27;re lying.
Azula: (walks past Zuko) If you say so.
Zuko: You have another motive for doing this. I just haven&#x27;t figure out
what it is.
Azula: Please, Zuko. What ulterior motive could I have? What could I
possibly gain by letting you get all the glory for defeating the Avatar?
Unless somehow, the Avatar was actually alive. All that glory would
suddenly turn to shame and foolishness. But you said yourself that was
impossible. Sleep well, Zuzu.

(Azula lays her head on her pillow and closes her eyes. Cut to a shot of
Zuko walking out of the room and down the hall. The scene cuts to a
lightning strike in the sky. Cut to Aang desperately trying to hang on to
the drift wood and not be swept away. He reaches out to his glider as it
floats further away. Aang yells as he is caught in a huge wave and is
plunged beneath the water. Aang swims back up and grab a hold of the drift
wood. Cut to a very close profile shot of Aang.)

Aang: I&#x27;m not gonna make it. I failed.

(There is another flash of lightning and the spirit of Avatar Roku appears
before Aang.)

Aang: Roku?
Roku: You haven&#x27;t failed, Aang.
Aang: But everyone thinks I am dead again. They think I&#x27;ve abandoned them,
and I&#x27;m losing this war. I&#x27;m letting the whole world down.
Roku: If anyone is to blame for the state of the world, it is me. I
should&#x27;ve seen this war coming, and prevented it. You inherited my
problems and my mistakes. But I also believe you are destined to redeem
me, and save the world.
Aang: I don&#x27;t know.

(A beam of moonlight casts over Aang.)

Yue: (off screen) You already saved the world.

(Aang looks up to the sky. The camera tilts up to show the moon shining
through the clouds. The spirit of Yue appears in front of it.)

Yue: And you&#x27;ll save the world again. But you can&#x27;t give up.

(Yue descends towards Aang. Cut to a shot of Aang staring in wonder. His
expression quickly turns to determination.)

Aang: You&#x27;re right. I won&#x27;t give up.

(Aang waves his arm in a circle. The camera zooms out far as Aang bends a
large wave of water behind him, pushing him forward. Cut to a shot of Aang
climbing on top of the drift wood and riding it like a surfboard. He waves
his hands to both sides and picks up speed. Cut to a shot behind the wave.
The camera tilts up and zooms out to show Yue, her back to the camera,
raising her arms, making the wave grow even higher. Cut to a shot of the
wave rolling across the ocean.

Cut to a shot of Aang riding on top of it and towards the camera. Cut back
to Yue as she ascends back to the moon. The scene fades to a shot of
Crescent Moon Isle. Lava trails flow from the top of the volcano and down
into the sea. The camera tilts up to one part of the shore where the lava
has not touched. Cut to a shot of Aang lying unconscious on the rocky
shore. The camera tilts up towards the top of the still active volcano.
Fade to another shot of the isle, only now it is dawn. Cut to a profile
shot of Aang still unconscious. Momo jumps onto Aang&#x27;s chest from off
screen and licks Aang&#x27;s cheek, awakening him. Momo hops off Aang as he
groans and sits up. Cut to a shot of Katara running to Aang. Sokka and
Toph follow after. Katara drops to her knees and hugs Aang&#x27;s head.)

Katara: You&#x27;re ok!

(Toph, Sokka, Momo and Appa all gather around and form a group hug. After
a moment, Aang breaks away.)

Aang: I have so much to do.
Katara: I know, but you&#x27;ll have our help.
Toph: You didn&#x27;t think you could get out of training just by coming to the
Fire Nation, did you?
Aang: What about the invasion?
Sokka: We&#x27;ll join up with my dad and the invasion force on the day of the
eclipse.

Toph: Hey, what&#x27;s... (grabs Aang&#x27;s broken and burnt glider from out of the
water) Oh...it&#x27;s your glider.

(Toph hands the glider to Aang as they all stand up.)

Aang: That&#x27;s okay. If someone saw it, it would give away my identity. It&#x27;s
better for now that no one knows I&#x27;m alive.

(Aang turns around and jumps onto a mound that trickling out lava. Cut to
a close up of Aang and zoom in as he looks down solemnly. Aang spins the
glider above his head and slams it into the lava end first before jumping
away. Cut to a shot of the glider sticking out of the mound and zoom out.
It ignites and is consumed by the flames.)

第一回
觉醒

25
00:01:40,640 --&gt; 00:01:42,912
发生了什么事？

26
00:01:49,116 --&gt; 00:01:50,617
啊，不好

27
00:02:00,261 --&gt; 00:02:03,396
听到了什么声音没有？

28
00:02:07,368 --&gt; 00:02:08,001
他醒了

29
00:02:10,404 --&gt; 00:02:11,371
别跑了，等等

30
00:02:18,613 --&gt; 00:02:19,713
模模？

31
00:02:24,485 --&gt; 00:02:27,320
“亮脚趾”，是你吧？

32
00:02:27,421 --&gt; 00:02:29,890
安昂，你醒了

33
00:02:29,991 --&gt; 00:02:31,024
真的吗？

34
00:02:31,125 --&gt; 00:02:33,526
我怎么觉得好像还是在做梦

35
00:02:33,628 --&gt; 00:02:34,261
你没做梦

36
00:02:34,362 --&gt; 00:02:36,096
你终于醒了

37
00:02:36,197 --&gt; 00:02:39,099
安昂，伙计，看到你活过来真是太好了

38
00:02:39,200 --&gt; 00:02:40,534
索卡？

39
00:02:41,736 --&gt; 00:02:42,802
不好，快点扶住他

40
00:02:42,904 --&gt; 00:02:44,437
他要...-

41
00:02:56,250 --&gt; 00:02:59,619
不冷吗？

42
00:02:59,720 --&gt; 00:03:01,755
脑子里太乱，想理理头绪

43
00:03:01,856 --&gt; 00:03:03,523
好久了

44
00:03:03,624 --&gt; 00:03:06,793
自从我离家到现在已经三年了

45
00:03:06,894 --&gt; 00:03:09,095
肯定有很多东西都变了

46
00:03:09,196 --&gt; 00:03:11,031
可能我也变了

47
00:03:11,832 --&gt; 00:03:13,033
我只是问了冷不冷嘛

48
00:03:13,134 --&gt; 00:03:18,138
你却跟我絮叨你的坎坷一生

49
00:03:18,239 --&gt; 00:03:24,211
别担心了

50
00:03:29,884 --&gt; 00:03:31,818
我们怎么会在火国的船上？

51
00:03:31,919 --&gt; 00:03:34,588
为什么大家都穿成这样？

52
00:03:34,689 --&gt; 00:03:37,691
为什么只有我和大家不一样？

53
00:03:37,792 --&gt; 00:03:39,526
放松点，没事的

54
00:03:39,627 --&gt; 00:03:42,696
你之前伤的很重

55
00:03:42,797 --&gt; 00:03:44,664
不过我很喜欢你的头发

56
00:03:44,765 --&gt; 00:03:47,234
我长头发了？

57
00:03:47,335 --&gt; 00:03:48,368
我昏迷多久了？

58
00:03:48,469 --&gt; 00:03:50,136
有个把星期了

59
00:03:50,238 --&gt; 00:03:51,471
一切还好吧？

60
00:03:51,572 --&gt; 00:03:52,505
父亲，我们都没事

61
00:03:52,607 --&gt; 00:03:55,675
我是哈库达，卡塔拉和索卡的父亲

62
00:03:55,776 --&gt; 00:03:56,710
他知道你是谁了

63
00:03:56,811 --&gt; 00:03:58,345
我刚才不是叫你父亲吗

64
00:03:58,446 --&gt; 00:04:00,313
是啊

65
00:04:00,414 --&gt; 00:04:04,417
哈库达酋长
终于见到您了，我很荣幸

66
00:04:04,518 --&gt; 00:04:05,685
见到你是我的荣幸

67
00:04:05,786 --&gt; 00:04:07,354
好了，好了

68
00:04:07,388 --&gt; 00:04:10,156
你们终于见面了
能让我和安昂单独呆一会儿吗？

69
00:04:10,258 --&gt; 00:04:13,693
没问题

70
00:04:13,794 --&gt; 00:04:16,563
你是在生你父亲的气吗？

71
00:04:16,664 --&gt; 00:04:18,231
你说啥？

72
00:04:18,332 --&gt; 00:04:20,000
没有啊，你为什么会这么说

73
00:04:20,101 --&gt; 00:04:21,268
这个...

74
00:04:23,004 --&gt; 00:04:24,237
我们还是上楼吧

75
00:04:24,338 --&gt; 00:04:26,907
该给你疗伤了

76
00:04:31,379 --&gt; 00:04:33,947
告诉我哪个地方最疼

77
00:04:34,949 --&gt; 00:04:36,216
再高一点

78
00:04:44,292 --&gt; 00:04:45,292
喔~

79
00:04:45,393 --&gt; 00:04:48,194
对，就是这儿了

80
00:04:48,296 --&gt; 00:04:51,331
我能感到很多能量在这附近纠缠

81
00:04:51,432 --&gt; 00:04:57,404
让我看看我能不能...

82
00:05:02,009 --&gt; 00:05:03,977
我倒下了

83
00:05:04,078 --&gt; 00:05:05,946
那时我不只是受伤那么简单吧

84
00:05:06,047 --&gt; 00:05:07,581
当时的情况应该更糟

85
00:05:07,682 --&gt; 00:05:10,550
本来我已经死了，是你让我活了过来

86
00:05:10,618 --&gt; 00:05:13,753
我只是用了从北极拿来的灵水

87
00:05:13,854 --&gt; 00:05:15,255
说实话我都不知道自己做了什么

88
00:05:15,356 --&gt; 00:05:17,791
是你救了我

89
00:05:17,892 --&gt; 00:05:21,294
你应该好好休息休息

90
00:05:21,395 --&gt; 00:05:27,067
这就是你们聪明美丽的公主阿祖拉

91
00:05:27,168 --&gt; 00:05:32,939
她伪装自己，打入了土强国首都的内部

92
00:05:33,040 --&gt; 00:05:39,012
在永固城，他找到了她的皇兄祖寇
两人并肩大战降世神通

93
00:05:41,282 --&gt; 00:05:46,786
他们战败了降世神通，战败了土国

94
00:05:46,888 --&gt; 00:05:51,358
阿祖拉的手下迅速占领了整个城市

95
00:05:51,459 --&gt; 00:05:55,095
他们击垮了永固城的....

96
00:05:55,196 --&gt; 00:06:01,167
...钢铁城墙

97
00:06:05,540 --&gt; 00:06:09,976
烈火国大军长驱直入...

98
00:06:10,077 --&gt; 00:06:15,749
开进永固城，捍卫了我们的胜利

99
00:06:27,194 --&gt; 00:06:30,897
现在，英雄们载誉而归

100
00:06:30,998 --&gt; 00:06:33,500
让我们欢迎你们的公主，阿祖拉

101
00:06:38,172 --&gt; 00:06:43,076
时隔三年，你们的王子也回来了

102
00:06:43,177 --&gt; 00:06:45,111
欢迎祖寇殿下

103
00:06:53,688 --&gt; 00:06:57,490
永固城一役之后
我们得把你转移到安全地带

104
00:06:57,592 --&gt; 00:07:03,129
我们飞回变色龙湾
在那里与我父亲和其他的水族人会合

105
00:07:03,231 --&gt; 00:07:08,468
土强王打算微服巡游世界
所以他只身出发了

106
00:07:08,569 --&gt; 00:07:09,903
那个，好像还有个伴

107
00:07:14,008 --&gt; 00:07:16,743
没多久，变色龙湾到处都是烈火国的军舰

108
00:07:16,844 --&gt; 00:07:20,480
我们没跟他们正面交锋
而是占领了一艘船作为咱们的伪装

109
00:07:20,581 --&gt; 00:07:22,816
之后，我们一路西行

110
00:07:22,917 --&gt; 00:07:25,051
几天前我们穿过了盘蛇关

111
00:07:25,152 --&gt; 00:07:27,921
虽然遭遇了几次火宗舰队
但都蒙混过关了

112
00:07:28,022 --&gt; 00:07:29,890
现在的计划是什么？

113
00:07:29,991 --&gt; 00:07:33,026
我们正在实行改良版的侵入计划

114
00:07:33,127 --&gt; 00:07:35,495
这侵入计划是索卡的点子

115
00:07:35,596 --&gt; 00:07:39,065
对，没错

116
00:07:39,166 --&gt; 00:07:42,536
没有土强国军队的协助
我们无法实行大规模的侵入

117
00:07:42,637 --&gt; 00:07:45,972
但日食仍会使火国实力大减

118
00:07:46,073 --&gt; 00:07:48,375
所以我们正在计划一个小规模的侵入行动

119
00:07:48,476 --&gt; 00:07:51,811
整个队伍由我们的朋友和土强国的睦邻组成

120
00:07:51,913 --&gt; 00:07:53,613
我们已经联系上了矮人和公爵

121
00:07:53,714 --&gt; 00:07:55,949
安昂，能见到你真是太好了

122
00:07:56,050 --&gt; 00:07:59,819
还有，日食还不是咱们最大的优势

123
00:07:59,921 --&gt; 00:08:02,889
我们有一个秘密武器

124
00:08:02,990 --&gt; 00:08:03,490
就是你啊

125
00:08:03,591 --&gt; 00:08:04,524
我？

126
00:08:04,559 --&gt; 00:08:07,093
对头，整个世界都认为你死了

127
00:08:07,194 --&gt; 00:08:10,063
是不是很棒？

128
00:08:12,733 --&gt; 00:08:14,267
世人都以为我死了？

129
00:08:14,368 --&gt; 00:08:16,536
这算什么好消息？

130
00:08:16,637 --&gt; 00:08:17,470
这太糟了

131
00:08:17,572 --&gt; 00:08:18,872
才不是呢

132
00:08:18,973 --&gt; 00:08:21,107
这意味着火宗再也不会派人来追杀我们了

133
00:08:21,209 --&gt; 00:08:24,477
他们更不会料到你会在日食那天出现

134
00:08:24,579 --&gt; 00:08:25,812
不对，不对，不对，不对

135
00:08:25,913 --&gt; 00:08:27,747
你不知道

136
00:08:27,848 --&gt; 00:08:29,482
一切都乱套了

137
00:08:32,253 --&gt; 00:08:33,987
交给我来收拾吧

138
00:08:34,088 --&gt; 00:08:35,622
我降世神通又回来了

139
00:08:37,091 --&gt; 00:08:38,124
安昂，等等

140
00:08:38,226 --&gt; 00:08:44,030
别忘了他们不知道我们不是火宗人

141
00:08:44,131 --&gt; 00:08:46,700
大家都镇静点

142
00:08:46,801 --&gt; 00:08:52,772
就交给我和巴图来处理吧

143
00:08:53,975 --&gt; 00:08:57,010
真讨厌这种无能为力的感觉

144
00:08:57,111 --&gt; 00:09:03,083
真盼着有一日你能无事可做
那时就可以天下太平了

145
00:09:09,957 --&gt; 00:09:13,159
指挥官，你为何不听从烈火王的命令

146
00:09:13,261 --&gt; 00:09:15,795
所有的西部舰船都应该...

147
00:09:15,897 --&gt; 00:09:18,465
...开往永固城帮助戍防

148
00:09:18,566 --&gt; 00:09:21,501
其实我们是来自东部的舰队

149
00:09:21,602 --&gt; 00:09:23,236
我们奉命押运一些货物

150
00:09:23,337 --&gt; 00:09:26,106
哦，是东部舰队

151
00:09:26,207 --&gt; 00:09:30,010
怎么陈司令派船过来也不知会一声

152
00:09:30,111 --&gt; 00:09:33,046
希望陈司令的命令不会冒犯到您

153
00:09:33,147 --&gt; 00:09:36,583
飞鹰传个信并没有那么费劲吧

154
00:09:36,684 --&gt; 00:09:42,489
下次我们一定用两只鹰同时发信
确保您能收到

155
00:09:42,590 --&gt; 00:09:46,359
长官，陈司令两个月前就已经离开去灰烬岛

156
00:09:46,460 --&gt; 00:09:47,394
什么？

157
00:09:47,428 --&gt; 00:09:49,462
怎么没人告诉过我

158
00:09:49,564 --&gt; 00:09:50,864
这船有点不对头

159
00:09:50,965 --&gt; 00:09:52,265
他们应该知道陈司令的去向

160
00:09:52,366 --&gt; 00:09:54,801
可能这艘船已被敌军占领了

161
00:09:54,902 --&gt; 00:09:57,537
先别声张，等我们安全回船后...

162
00:09:57,638 --&gt; 00:09:59,940
...把这艘船给我弄沉了

163
00:10:00,041 --&gt; 00:10:04,044
被他们识破了

164
00:10:35,610 --&gt; 00:10:37,644
你看起来有点消沉啊

165
00:10:37,745 --&gt; 00:10:39,312
梅已经找过你了吗？

166
00:10:39,413 --&gt; 00:10:43,016
梅最近可是好心情着呢

167
00:10:43,117 --&gt; 00:10:44,918
我还没有见到父王

168
00:10:45,019 --&gt; 00:10:48,655
自从我被放逐后
我已经三年没见到父王了

169
00:10:48,756 --&gt; 00:10:49,789
那又怎么样

170
00:10:49,891 --&gt; 00:10:52,158
可我并没有抓到降世神通

171
00:10:52,260 --&gt; 00:10:53,393
管他呢

172
00:10:53,494 --&gt; 00:10:57,130
降世神通都已经死了

173
00:10:57,231 --&gt; 00:11:02,068
除非你认为他还有可能活着

174
00:11:02,169 --&gt; 00:11:06,172
这圣水来自北极的“灵洲”

175
00:11:06,274 --&gt; 00:11:10,844
它有神奇的功效
所以我要好好地保管它以备不时之需

176
00:11:10,945 --&gt; 00:11:12,979
当然不会

177
00:11:13,080 --&gt; 00:11:18,051
降世神通肯定已经死了

178
00:11:19,587 --&gt; 00:11:25,559
那你还杞人忧天些什么？

179
00:12:19,747 --&gt; 00:12:25,719
我来搞个烟雾弹

180
00:12:40,835 --&gt; 00:12:46,072
我不能就这样袖手旁观

181
00:12:46,173 --&gt; 00:12:47,774
安昂，你要干嘛

182
00:12:47,875 --&gt; 00:12:50,810
你还受着伤，而且你还不能暴露身份

183
00:12:50,912 --&gt; 00:12:53,213
交给我们就行了

184
00:12:53,314 --&gt; 00:12:56,216
你说了算

185
00:13:04,792 --&gt; 00:13:06,493
我们做的还不错吧

186
00:13:06,594 --&gt; 00:13:09,462
应该已经熬过去了

187
00:13:11,265 --&gt; 00:13:14,801
老天，你太稀罕我了吧

188
00:13:14,902 --&gt; 00:13:16,603
谁让你总那么天真来着

189
00:13:28,649 --&gt; 00:13:34,621
老天，就知道你对我最好了

190
00:13:41,762 --&gt; 00:13:44,097
嘿，安昂

191
00:13:44,198 --&gt; 00:13:45,966
我们想去城里下个馆子撮一顿

192
00:13:47,501 --&gt; 00:13:49,769
我也饿坏了

193
00:13:49,871 --&gt; 00:13:51,438
俺也跟你们一起去

194
00:13:51,539 --&gt; 00:13:53,240
来，把这个戴在头上

195
00:13:53,341 --&gt; 00:13:55,442
可以把头上的箭头标志藏起来

196
00:13:55,543 --&gt; 00:13:58,612
要是不能光明正大的出去，那就算了

197
00:13:58,713 --&gt; 00:13:59,779
安昂，别这样

198
00:13:59,881 --&gt; 00:14:00,814
耍什么小脸子

199
00:14:00,915 --&gt; 00:14:03,016
你们先去吧

200
00:14:03,117 --&gt; 00:14:05,352
我们随后就到

201
00:14:05,453 --&gt; 00:14:10,624
我知道，隐姓埋名让你很痛苦

202
00:14:10,725 --&gt; 00:14:12,158
你不想大家认为你是败者

203
00:14:12,260 --&gt; 00:14:13,894
你说对了

204
00:14:13,995 --&gt; 00:14:16,296
但是实际上，我是失败了

205
00:14:16,364 --&gt; 00:14:18,698
安昂，你并没有失败

206
00:14:18,799 --&gt; 00:14:20,267
我是败了

207
00:14:20,368 --&gt; 00:14:21,902
我那时在永固城

208
00:14:22,003 --&gt; 00:14:24,938
我在那儿，可我输了

209
00:14:25,039 --&gt; 00:14:27,574
现在土国也已经不复存在了

210
00:14:27,675 --&gt; 00:14:29,543
并不是永远的消逝了

211
00:14:29,644 --&gt; 00:14:31,311
别忘了，我们还有计划

212
00:14:31,412 --&gt; 00:14:32,245
侵入计划

213
00:14:32,280 --&gt; 00:14:33,980
别提那个侵入计划了

214
00:14:34,081 --&gt; 00:14:38,985
我不希望你们大家牺牲
自己的生命来弥补我犯下的错误

215
00:14:39,086 --&gt; 00:14:42,122
我知道我注定要和火王对决

216
00:14:42,223 --&gt; 00:14:44,190
而且我必须单独面对

217
00:14:44,292 --&gt; 00:14:46,226
安昂

218
00:14:46,327 --&gt; 00:14:47,394
卡塔拉，拜托了

219
00:14:47,495 --&gt; 00:14:52,399
拜托你走吧
走吧

220
00:14:52,500 --&gt; 00:14:55,635
你需要什么吗？

221
00:14:55,736 --&gt; 00:14:58,071
我需要挽回自己的错误

222
00:14:58,172 --&gt; 00:15:00,674
我要赢回我的尊严

223
00:15:26,834 --&gt; 00:15:30,737
我给你带了点吃的

224
00:15:30,838 --&gt; 00:15:36,810
天哪，不好

225
00:15:47,955 --&gt; 00:15:51,324
你离开了很久

226
00:15:51,425 --&gt; 00:15:54,294
看来你放逐的历练已经改变了你

227
00:15:54,362 --&gt; 00:16:00,367
我的儿子，你已经挽回了自己的错误

228
00:16:02,203 --&gt; 00:16:06,406
欢迎回家

229
00:16:22,290 --&gt; 00:16:26,326
我让你们单独谈谈吧

230
00:16:26,427 --&gt; 00:16:27,827
卡塔拉，怎么了？

231
00:16:27,929 --&gt; 00:16:29,229
他离开了

232
00:16:29,330 --&gt; 00:16:29,663
你说什么？

233
00:16:29,764 --&gt; 00:16:30,864
安昂离开了

234
00:16:30,965 --&gt; 00:16:33,366
他拿着滑翼离开了

235
00:16:33,467 --&gt; 00:16:37,370
他说他要一个人去拯救世界，这太荒唐了

236
00:16:37,471 --&gt; 00:16:39,306
他说拯救世界只是他一个人的责任

237
00:16:39,407 --&gt; 00:16:41,908
也许这是他表现勇敢的方法吧

238
00:16:42,009 --&gt; 00:16:42,642
这哪里是勇敢

239
00:16:42,743 --&gt; 00:16:44,744
分明是自私，是愚蠢

240
00:16:44,845 --&gt; 00:16:47,347
我知道世界需要他，而我们能帮助他

241
00:16:47,448 --&gt; 00:16:50,317
但他不知道我们也十分需要他

242
00:16:50,418 --&gt; 00:16:51,751
他不能就这么丢下我们不管

243
00:16:51,852 --&gt; 00:16:56,056
你也是在说我吧

244
00:16:56,157 --&gt; 00:16:59,059
爸爸，你当初怎么能离开我们？

245
00:16:59,160 --&gt; 00:17:04,130
我们虽然有很爱我们姥姥
可...可我们也不能没有你啊

246
00:17:07,134 --&gt; 00:17:10,937
卡塔拉，我真对不起你们啊

247
00:17:11,038 --&gt; 00:17:13,673
我知道你为什么要离开

248
00:17:13,774 --&gt; 00:17:19,746
我明明知道你走是因为你别无选择
可我为什么还这么难受呢？

249
00:17:21,716 --&gt; 00:17:25,318
我好懊恼，好生气
心好痛好痛（编剧看过琼瑶剧？）

250
00:17:25,419 --&gt; 00:17:28,455
你是我最爱的人

251
00:17:28,556 --&gt; 00:17:30,957
你和索卡就是我的整个世界

252
00:17:31,058 --&gt; 00:17:36,296
我离开后每天每夜都在想着你们

253
00:17:36,397 --&gt; 00:17:41,368
我想你们想的无法入睡
想你们想的头好痛好痛

254
00:17:43,104 --&gt; 00:17:46,506
祖寇，我很为你骄傲

255
00:17:46,607 --&gt; 00:17:50,677
你和你妹妹能够攻下永固城，我很欣慰

256
00:17:50,778 --&gt; 00:17:56,182
能够大义灭亲抓住你的叛徒
皇叔，证明了你的忠诚

257
00:17:56,284 --&gt; 00:17:59,986
你做的很好，我以你为傲

258
00:18:00,087 --&gt; 00:18:04,791
最令我欣慰的是完成了传奇的成就

259
00:18:04,892 --&gt; 00:18:08,361
——解决了降世神通

260
00:18:08,462 --&gt; 00:18:09,262
您听说了？

261
00:18:09,363 --&gt; 00:18:12,299
阿祖拉全都告诉我了

262
00:18:12,400 --&gt; 00:18:14,467
她说那时你的力量和残忍

263
00:18:14,569 --&gt; 00:18:20,540
令她很惊讶，印象深刻

264
00:18:26,280 --&gt; 00:18:29,149
有路障~

265
00:19:15,830 --&gt; 00:19:18,365
你干嘛要这么做？

266
00:19:18,466 --&gt; 00:19:22,569
说的详细点好让我知道你在说什么

267
00:19:22,670 --&gt; 00:19:26,506
你为什么告诉父王是我杀了降世神通

268
00:19:26,607 --&gt; 00:19:28,208
咱们不能明早再谈吗？

269
00:19:28,276 --&gt; 00:19:29,543
不——行

270
00:19:30,811 --&gt; 00:19:31,945
好吧好吧

271
00:19:31,979 --&gt; 00:19:35,448
由于你没有抓到降世神通

272
00:19:35,550 --&gt; 00:19:37,384
所以很在意父王会怎么对待你

273
00:19:37,485 --&gt; 00:19:41,221
所以我想只要给了你声望，你就不用再担心什么了

274
00:19:41,322 --&gt; 00:19:42,455
为什么要这么做

275
00:19:42,557 --&gt; 00:19:44,357
就当作一个慷慨的礼物吧

276
00:19:44,458 --&gt; 00:19:48,662
很感激你的帮助，也很高兴能和你分享荣耀

277
00:19:48,763 --&gt; 00:19:50,497
你在说谎

278
00:19:50,598 --&gt; 00:19:52,799
你爱怎么说就怎么说吧

279
00:19:52,900 --&gt; 00:19:54,534
你肯定另有所图

280
00:19:54,635 --&gt; 00:19:57,070
只是我现在还没有想到你的目的是什么

281
00:19:57,171 --&gt; 00:19:58,471
拜托了，祖寇

282
00:19:58,573 --&gt; 00:20:00,974
我能有什么企图

283
00:20:01,075 --&gt; 00:20:05,845
让你独占战败降世神通的荣耀对我有什么好处

284
00:20:05,947 --&gt; 00:20:10,083
除非...除非降世神通还活着

285
00:20:10,184 --&gt; 00:20:15,455
那些荣耀就会马上变成耻辱和无知

286
00:20:15,556 --&gt; 00:20:20,760
不过那不可能，你自己也说过的

287
00:20:20,861 --&gt; 00:20:26,833
好好睡吧， 祖祖

288
00:20:48,890 --&gt; 00:20:51,124
我不会成功的

289
00:20:51,225 --&gt; 00:20:52,025
我失败了

290
00:20:53,261 --&gt; 00:20:55,795
罗库大师？

291
00:20:55,897 --&gt; 00:20:57,797
你并没有失败，安昂

292
00:20:57,899 --&gt; 00:21:00,433
可所有人又都认为我已经死了

293
00:21:00,535 --&gt; 00:21:05,205
他们可定会认为我放弃了他们
我输掉了战争

294
00:21:05,273 --&gt; 00:21:07,173
我令全天下失望了

295
00:21:07,275 --&gt; 00:21:12,412
世界变成这样都是我的问题

296
00:21:12,513 --&gt; 00:21:15,649
我应该预见到战争的到来
并阻止它的发生

297
00:21:15,750 --&gt; 00:21:20,854
你继承了我的问题和我的错误

298
00:21:20,955 --&gt; 00:21:26,226
但我相信你能挽回我的错误，你能拯救世界

299
00:21:26,327 --&gt; 00:21:28,728
我不知道

300
00:21:28,829 --&gt; 00:21:33,967
你已经拯救了世界

301
00:21:34,068 --&gt; 00:21:35,835
你会再一次拯救世界的

302
00:21:35,937 --&gt; 00:21:40,907
你不能就这么放弃

303
00:21:42,243 --&gt; 00:21:44,177
你说的对

304
00:21:44,278 --&gt; 00:21:50,250
我不会放弃的

305
00:22:34,562 --&gt; 00:22:40,534
你没事，太好了

306
00:22:44,705 --&gt; 00:22:48,341
我还有很多事要做

307
00:22:48,442 --&gt; 00:22:50,510
我知道，但你不能拒绝我们帮你

308
00:22:50,611 --&gt; 00:22:52,145
你不是打算没跟我修炼完御土术...

309
00:22:52,246 --&gt; 00:22:54,147
...就想杀入烈火国吧

310
00:22:54,248 --&gt; 00:22:57,117
“侵入计划”怎么办？

311
00:22:57,218 --&gt; 00:23:01,187
我们将会在日食日那天与我父亲回合

312
00:23:01,289 --&gt; 00:23:03,356
嘿，这是...

313
00:23:03,457 --&gt; 00:23:07,294
啊，是你的滑翼

314
00:23:07,395 --&gt; 00:23:08,495
没关系的

315
00:23:08,529 --&gt; 00:23:13,567
如果让人看到它的话，会暴露我的身份的

316
00:23:13,668 --&gt; 00:23:19,639
从现在开始
最好让天下人都以为我已经死了

317

土强国

3
00:00:07,026 --&gt; 00:00:08,771
火烈国

4
00:00:08,958 --&gt; 00:00:09,851
气和国

5
00:00:11,297 --&gt; 00:00:12,109
很久以前

6
00:00:12,109 --&gt; 00:00:14,826
这四大国和谐共处

7
00:00:14,906 --&gt; 00:00:19,015
然而，烈火国发起的战争结束了和平

8
00:00:20,008 --&gt; 00:00:23,828
只有同时掌握四种元素的降世神通才能结束战争

9
00:00:23,828 --&gt; 00:00:25,787
然而在大家最需要他的时候

10
00:00:25,787 --&gt; 00:00:26,854
他却消失了

11
00:00:26,854 --&gt; 00:00:31,116
100年后，我和哥哥发现了转世的降世神通，

12
00:00:31,116 --&gt; 00:00:33,214
他是个御气师，名叫“安昂”

13
00:00:33,214 --&gt; 00:00:35,306
尽管他的御气术着实厉害

00:00:35,306 --&gt; 00:00:38,283
在拯救苍生之前，他要学的还有很多

15
00:00:38,283 --&gt; 00:00:42,549
但是我坚信 安昂能拯救这个世界

降世神通 前情提要

18
00:00:50,883 --&gt; 00:00:52,957
祖寇，我以你为傲

19
00:00:52,957 --&gt; 00:00:56,713
你的忠诚经受住了考验

20
00:00:56,713 --&gt; 00:00:59,096
没被你的那位叛徒皇叔所左右

21
00:00:59,096 --&gt; 00:01:00,560
你做的对

22
00:01:00,560 --&gt; 00:01:01,912
抓住了那个叛徒

23
00:01:01,912 --&gt; 00:01:05,148
为什么你告诉父王是我杀了降世神通

24
00:01:05,148 --&gt; 00:01:06,806
拜托，祖寇

25
00:01:06,806 --&gt; 00:01:09,323
我会有什么不良企图

26
00:01:09,323 --&gt; 00:01:13,538
除非神通还活着

27
00:01:13,538 --&gt; 00:01:17,344
那荣耀瞬间就会化为耻辱
