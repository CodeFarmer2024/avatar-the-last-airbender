Sozin’s Comet, Part 3: Into The Inferno

Written By: Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko

Transcribers: Icy_Ashford and Psycho Silver

Act I

(The episode opens with an overhead shot from high up as Sozin’s Comet
streaks over the ground, its red energy destroying the clouds in its path.
Cut to a close up of the comet from the front. Cut to a shot of Appa
flying in the air. Cut to a closer shot of Zuko and Katara riding on top.)

Katara: Zuko, don’t worry, we can take Azula.
Zuko: I’m not worried about her, I’m worried about Aang. What if he
doesn’t have the guts to take out my Father‌ What if he loses‌
Katara: Aang won’t lose. He’s gonna come back. He has to.

(Zuko looks forward as the scene fades to a shot of the Fire Nation
palace. Cut to a shot of Azula’s hair being combed from the back. Cut to a
shot of Azula’s heel being scrubbed. Cut to a wider shot showing three
servant girls grooming Azula, and one other kneeling and holding a bowl of
cherries up to her. Azula takes a cherry and begins to chew it. The camera
cuts to a close up of her. It then zooms in as a crunching noise is heard
and Azula opens her eyes in surprise. Azula spits the pit of the cherry
into her palm and shows it to the servant girl serving the cherries.)

Azula: (sternly) What am I holding‌
Servant Girl: (quietly) A cherry pit, Princess.
Azula: Correct. And what day is this‌
Servant Girl: It is the day of your coronation.
Azula: Yes, it is. So please, tell me why on the most important day of my
life you decided to leave a pit in my cherry‌ (Glares at the pit between
her fingers and throws it at the servant girl’s head)
Servant Girl: It wasn’t a decision. It was just a small mistake.
Azula: Small‌ Do you realize what could have happened if I hadn’t sensed
the pit in time‌ (the other servant girls look to the one with the
cherries, worried)
Servant Girl: I supposed you could have… choked‌
Azula: Yes. Then you will understand the severity of your crime.
Servant Girl: (bowing her head to the floor) I understand, Princess.
Please, forgive me.
Azula: (nonchalant) Oh very well. Since this is a special day, I will show
mercy. (the servant smiles, relieved) You are banished. Leave this palace
immediately. (the servant stands up and slowly walks backwards off screen,
keeping her head down) What are you all looking at‌ I have two feet that
need scrubbing. And make sure you get in between the toes. (holds the foot
scrubber up to the camera with her toes) I won’t have my first day as Fire
Lord marred by poor foot hygiene.

(The scene cuts to a body of water. The camera tilts up to show the eel
hound swimming through it with Sokka, Toph, and Suki riding on top. A
bright red light is seen on the horizon behind them.)

Suki: It’s weird to say, but the comet actually looks beautiful.
Toph: Too bad the Fire Lord is about to use it to destroy the World.

(The camera follows them and zooms out, showing them heading toward land
in the distance. The scene fades to a shot of the eel hound reaching
shore. The passengers dismount and continue on. Cut to a shot of them
climbing up a hill to the edge of a cliff. Cut to an overhead shot of them
reaching the top to find Fire Nation airships beginning to take off, with
Ozai’s giant airship leading.)

Sokka: We’re too late! The fleet’s already taking off!
Toph: Then we’re taking off too. Where’s the closest airship‌
Sokka: It’s right…

(Before Sokka can answer, Toph grabs him and Suki by the back of their
shirts and catapults the three of them into the air by bending a pillar of
rock up from underneath them. They are flung high into the air, and then
slowly fall towards an airship. Sokka and Suki land on the airship’s
catwalk while catching Toph in the fall.)

Toph: Ugh.

(Cut to a shot of the three of them climbing up a ladder and into the main
body of the airship. The camera pulls back and rotates around to the front
of the airship fleet. It continues to pull back until it has reached the
front of Ozai’s ship, rotating around and zooming in on Ozai as he stands
on the front platform, wearing his Phoenix King armour and grinning.

The scenes cuts to Dai Li agents walking forward in the Fire Nation throne
room, where Azula is seated, surrounded by blue flames. The approach Azula
and kneel before her.)

Dai Li Agent: You sent for us, Princess‌ Is everything alright‌
Azula: (irritated) Actually, everything’s not alright. Do you know how
long it took you to get here‌
Dai Li Agent: A… few minutes I guess‌
Azula: Five, to be precise. In which time an assassin could have snuck in,
done away with me and been on his merry way.
Dai Li Agent: My apologies, Princess.
Azula: Is this how you plan to treat your new Fire Lord‌ With tardiness
and disloyalty‌
Dai Li Agent: The Dai Li would never betray you.
Azula: And I’m sure that’s just what you told Long Feng before you turned
against him and joined me. You’re all banished! (the camera quickly zooms
out from the Dai Li agents as the look up, shocked)
Dai Li Agent: But…
Azula: (offscreen) Goodbye.

(The lead agent takes one last glare at Azula before getting up and
walking away. The other agents follow after.)

Azula: Please send in the next group on your way out.

(Cut to a shot of Azula. The camera zooms in on her as she tilts her head
down and glares just before the scene cuts to a wide, overhead shot of the
Fire Nation air fleet flying over the ocean. Cut to a close shot of one
airship’s cabin from the outside, and then cut to a shot of the door
leading into the cabin. Sokka and Suki slowly walk towards it and put
their backs to the wall next to the door.)

Sokka: Shh.

(Toph walks up to the door and raises her hand to it. Cut to a shot of
inside the cabin where three pilots and the captain are standing. They
hear a knock from the door, in the same rhythm of ‘shave and a haircut.’
The camera cuts to a shot of the door from their side. On the last knock,
the door is knocked down by Toph kicking it. Immediately after, Toph falls
forward on to the fallen door and rolls, using metal bending to cover the
metal door all around her body like armour. A fire blast hits Toph, but
she is unharmed. Cut to a shot of the captain looking surprised. He
punches and sends another fireball at Toph, but she rolls backwards to
avoid the attack, and in the same movement kicks her leg into the air,
which bends the sheet of metal the captain is standing on up and through
the ceiling. One of the firebenders shoots a fire blast at Toph, who
shields herself with the metal plates on the floor. Cut to Sokka and Suki
as they both dodge to the sides of the door, avoiding the fire blast which
has been strengthened by the comet.

Cut back to the inside of the cabin as the flames die down. Toph jumps up
from behind her shield and kicks to the side, bending a large metal pipe
on the ceiling towards one of the firebenders and pinning him to the wall.
She swings her leg to the other side and bends part of the metal floor up
at another firebender just as he attacks, which pins him to the other
wall. From her back, Toph springs upwards and clings to the ceiling. She
begins crawling towards the front of the cabin. The last remaining
firebender shoots a fire blast at Toph but misses. Toph jumps down from
the ceiling behind the firebender. He swings his arm around to catch Toph
with a fiery whip attack, but she blocks his arm with her armour covered
arm. Cut to a shot outside the cabin as the firebender’s blocked attack
bursts through a window. Back in the cabin, the firebender holds his
forearm painfully. Just as he looks back up to Toph, she delivers a
straight punch to his face. Sokka and Suki watch as he flies through the
door and hits the wall off screen. Cut to a shot of Sokka and Suki peeping
into the cabin, the firebender knocked out behind them. They walk into the
cabin, which is now mangled due to Toph’s metal bending. Toph peels the
metal from around her head, then quickly sheds the rest of the makeshift
armour off her body.)

Toph: That’s how it’s done.
Sokka: Good work, Toph. Time to take control of the ship. Take the wheel.
Toph: (sarcastically) That’s a great idea! Let the blind girl steer the
giant airship.
Sokka: I was talking to Suki.
Toph: That would make a lot more sense.
Suki: (taking the wheel) What are we going to do about the rest of the
crew‌
Sokka: Take us down closer to the water. I’ve got an idea.

(Sokka looks around the cabin, and then grabs a speaker connected to a
tube.)

Sokka: (clears his throat and begins imitating a captain’s voice)
Attention crew, this is your Captain speaking. Everyone please report to
the bomb bay immediately for hot cakes and… sweet cream. We have a very
special birthday to celebrate.

(Cut to the engineers of the airship loading coal into the engines. They
stop what they are doing and begin walking off once they hear Sokka’s
announcement. Cut to a shot of the airship descending towards the water
below. Cut to a shot of the airship crew all gathered in the bomb bay. The
camera pans right until it comes to an elite firebender and an engineer.
The firebender turns to the engineer.)

Elite Firebender #1: Hey. I’m Quin Lee, I work up in communications.
Engineer: Oh hi, I work down in the engine room. It’s probably why we’ve
never met before. Big airship, you know‌
Elite Firebender #1: Huh.
Engineer: Yep.
Elite Firebender #1: So, do you know whose birthday it is‌
Elite Firebender #2: (approaching the firebender and engineer from behind)
I can’t believe the Captain remembered my birthday! He really does care.

(Immediately after the sentence is finished, the bomb bay doors open and
they are dropped into the ocean. Cut to a shot from above of the doors
opening below, then a shot from the side of the airship of the crew
falling into the water. The firebenders that Toph had taken out can also
be seen falling out of the cabin. Cut to the water’s level as some of the
crew comes up for air.)

Engineer: Happy Birthday.

(Cut to a shot of Ozai’s airship from below. The camera pulls back through
the broken window of the cabin as Sokka walks toward it, looking up at the
other airship with Suki. Cut to a close up of Sokka and zoom in.)

Sokka: Fire Lord Ozai, here we come.

(Cut to a shot of Sokka grabbing the throttle and pushing it forward. Cut
to a shot of Ozai. The camera pans right until he is in the center. Cut to
commercial.)

Act II

(The show returns to a shot of the Fire Nation royal palace. Cut to a shot
of Azula at the throne, lying against one of the pillars that surround it.
She looks left just as footsteps are heard. Cut to a shot of Lo and Li
walking towards the throne.)

Li: Azula, we heard what happened. Why have you banished all your
servants‌
Lo: All your Dai Li agents‌
Li: And the Imperial firebenders‌
Azula: None of them could be trusted. Sooner or later, they all would have
betrayed me. Just like Mai and Ty Lee did.
Li &amp; Lo: Azula, we are concerned for you and your well being.
Azula: (glares at Lo and Li) My Father asked you to come here and talk to
me, didn’t he‌ He thinks I can’t handle the responsibility of being Fire
Lord. But I will be the greatest leader in Fire Nation history.
Lo: I’m sure you will. But considering everything that has happened today…

Li: Perhaps it’s best you postponed your coronation.
Azula: (angrily) What‌! Which one of you just said that‌

(Lo and Li both point at each other.)

Azula: What a shame. There’s only one way to resolve this. You two must
duel each other. I order you to fight an Agni Kai.
Lo: But…
Li &amp; Lo: We’re not firebenders.
Azula: Alright, fine. (Pointing to Li) Lo, you’re banished. (Pointing to
Lo) Li, you can stay. (walks off screen)
Li: But I’m Li. So who’s banished‌

(Lo shrugs at Li. The scene cuts to an overhead shot of Ba Sing Se as Fire
Nation tanks roll through the streets towards the main gate. Cut to a shot
of the main gate as the tanks line up. The camera tilts up past the inner
wall and focuses on three giant stone platforms in the distance, where the
members of the Order of the White Lotus have gathered. Cut to a shot of a
flag of the Order of the White lotus billowing in the wind. Cut to a shot
of Jeong Jeong, Bumi, Pakku, and Piandao from the side, panning right.)

Bumi: Ba Sing Se, the Order of the White Lotus is here.
Pakku: Here to set you free.

(Cut to a shot of Iroh standing in front of the other Order members,
tilting up.)

Iroh: Only once every hundred years can a firebender experience this kind
of power.

(Iroh inhales deeply through his nose and the scene fades to a shot of
Sozin’s Comet. The scene fades back to the same shot of Iroh as he
exhales, and a ring of flame appears around the group. Iroh continues to
breathe deeply, and each time he inhales, the flames grow larger. Cut to a
shot above and behind the group. The ring of fire around them continues
top grow more intense, pulsing with each of Iroh’s breaths. Cut back to
the shot of Iroh. He opens his eyes and raises his arms. The camera zooms
out as he thrusts his hands forward and gives a battle cry. The flames
surrounding him converge into one giant ball of fire. A sound can be heard
as the fireball gains energy, just before it is unleashed forward as a
massive fire blast. The attack rockets forward and demolished the wall in
front of it. Debris flies everywhere, landing amongst the Fire Nation
tanks. Cut to the frontal shot of the five old masters. Bumi hops forward
and stomps the ground. The three stone platforms the Order members are
standing on begin to quickly slide towards Ba Sing Se. Cut to a shot from
behind the destroyed section of the wall as fire blasts are shot at the
Order members, only to be deflected. Cut to a shot of Iroh deflected the
attacks. The old masters all leap off of the stone platform.

Cut to a shot of an alleyway. Pakku jumps up from behind a building and
onto its roof. He bends a enormous wave of water over the building and
down towards the Fire Nation soldiers below. Cut to a close up of Pakku.
The camera tilts up to the peak of the wave as Piandoa leaps over it. Cut
to the previous shot as Pakku turns the wave into ice, freezing the
soldiers in place. Piandao slides down the frozen wave and slashes the
ends of the soldier’s spears, followed closely behind by Pakku. As they
slide into another street, Pakku unfreezes the water, bends it up in front
of him and freezes it again to block an incoming fire blast. The ice
barrier is destroyed, and another fire blast is about to hit Pakku when a
great wall of fire erupts in front of him, stopping the attack.

The camera quickly tilts up towards Jeong Jeong, the one who created the
wall of fire, floating in the air using firebending to create fire jets
beneath his feet. Jeong Jeong turns to another street. A line of tanks
begin to fire on him, but he stops the attacks with another wall of fire.
The camera cuts to a wide shot to show him hovering over a large
intersection of streets, with tanks surrounding him. He hovers toward
another street and creates another wall of fire to block an attack. Jeong
Jeong waves his arms in the air and thrusts them forward, sending the wall
of fire down the street and towards the tanks, pushing them back. More
tanks begin to fire on him from another street, but Jeong Jeong repeats
his last actions, creating a wall of flame and attacking the tanks with
it. The tanks can be seen knocked over and in a pile as the wall of fire
pushes another tank into the pile.

The scene cuts to Azula standing in front of a large mirror. Cut to a
close up of her hair as she pulls it into a top knot. She takes a red
ribbon and begins to tie it. She looks up at her reflection and sees that
her finger is caught in the knot. Frustrated, she yanks he finger out and
grabs a pair of scissors from the table next to her.)

Azula: Alright hair, it’s time to face your doom.

(Azula grabs the bangs hanging in front of her face. Cut to a close up of
the scissors as she lifts them in the air. Cut to a close up of her bangs
as they are cut, then to an overhead shot of the hair falling to Azula’s
feet. Cut to a shot from behind Azula. Her reflection in the mirror shows
her grinning insanely, her hair a mess, but her grin disappears as the
camera pans left to show Ursa in the reflection behind Azula.)

Ursa: (off screen) What a shame, you always had such beautiful hair.
Azula: What are you doing here‌
Ursa: I didn’t want to miss my own daughter’s coronation.
Azula: Don’t pretend to act proud. I know what you really think of me. You
think I’m a monster.
Ursa: I think you’re confused. All your life you used fear to control
people. Like your friends Mai and Ty Lee.
Azula: But what choice do I have‌! Trust is for fools. Fear is the only
reliable way. Even you fear me.
Ursa: No. I love you, Azula. I do.

(Cut to a close up of Azula’s lip quivering. She lowers her head, tears
dripping from her eyes. Cut to a close up of her hand clutching a brush on
the table. She suddenly turns around and angrily throws the brush at the
reflection of Ursa, shattering the mirror. Cut to an overhead shot of the
room. Azula is alone. She falls to her knees and starts to sob.

The scene cuts to a shot of the ground. The camera tilts up to the ocean,
then to the approaching Fire Nation fleet of airships. Cut to a shot of
Ozai from behind, still standing at the front of his airship. Cut to a
shot of Ozai from the front and zoom in as he inhales deeply. He exhales,
opens his eyes, and smiles. Cut to a shot of Ozai’s airship from above.
The other airship’s can be seen behind it, and the airship that Sokka,
Suki, and Toph took can be seen just beneath it. Cut to a shot of Ozai’s
airship from Sokka’s point of view as he looks through a spyglass.)

Sokka: We’re not going to catch up to him in time.
Suki: (sadly) No…

(Cut to a shot of Ozai from above and zoom in as he spreads his arms
outward and tilts his head back. The scene fades to a shot of the comet
before fading back to a close up of Ozai. He tilts his head back down and
smiles sadistically. Ozai raises his arms in the air, then thrusts his
palm down towards the ground beneath. A small but incredibly intense flame
ignites in front of his hand, growing steadily larger until it finally
erupts into an enormous fire blast that ignites the earth below. The
camera zooms in on Ozai’s face as he swathes the earth in fire. Cut to a
shot from behind Ozai. The camera tilts up, past his great stream of fire,
towards to horizon. Cut to a shot from behind a tall, stone pillar and
tilt up to Aang standing on top of it, facing Ozai’s assault. Cut to a
closer shot of Aang from behind, and then rotate around to his front. Momo
is seated on his shoulder and chirps.)

Aang: Momo, time for you to go.

(Momo leaps off of Aang’s shoulder. Aang closes his eyes and breathes
deeply. Aang proceeds to perform several spinning kicks, using
earthbending to send giant sections of the stone pillar beneath him
towards Ozai’s ship. The chunks of rock whistle past the side of Ozai’s
airship, which catches his notice. The last few pieces of rock strike the
airship’s engine, which causes Ozai to lose balance and cease his attack.
Cut to a shot from the side of the airship as smoke drifts from the
engine. It loses power and begins to descend. Ozai looks down to see Aang.
Aang spins his body around, gathering his energy, and unleashes a huge
fire blast at Ozai’s ship, striking the finishing blow to its engine.

Aang turns to the side towards the airship and it floats past him, facing
Ozai for the first time. Cut to a close up of Ozai, staring at Aang with
surprise. Cut to a shot from behind Ozai. Aang can be seen standing on top
of a stone pillar in the distance. Cut to a close up of Aang facing Ozai
as he lowers his bending stance. Cut to a shot of Ozai and zoom out as
Ozai removes his Phoenix King armour and cloak, burning it and leaving his
chest bare. Ozai leaps off of the platform he is standing on, using his
firebending to fly like a rocket towards Aang. Cut to a wide shot from
behind Aang of Ozai’s airship crashing into the field of giant stone
pillars, and Ozai flying towards Aang. Cut to a shot of Aang, the zoom out
until the top of another stone pillar comes into view, which Ozai lands
on. Cut to a shot Ozai as the camera tilts up from his feet towards his
face, his airship smouldering behind him.

Cut to a shot of the burning airship from Sokka’s point of view through a
spyglass. Cut to a shot of Suki, Sokka, and Toph inside the airship
cabin.)

Suki: What just happened‌
Sokka: (excited) It’s Aang! He’s back!

(Cut to a shot of Aang and zoom in. Cut to commercial.)

Act III

(The show returns to a shot of the stone pillars. The camera rises up to
the top, where Aang and Ozai are facing each other. Cut to a close up of
Aang.)

Ozai: (off screen) After generations of Fire Lords failed to find you, now
the Universe delivers you to me as an act of providence.
Aang: Please listen to me. We don’t have to fight. You have the power to
end it here and stop what you’re doing.
Ozai: You are right. I do have the power. I have all the power in the
World!

(At the end of Ozai’s last line, torrents of fire erupt from Ozai’s mouth
and hands and the camera zooms out. Cut to a shot of Aang as he enters his
battle stance. Cut to a shot of Ozai as the flames die down and looks to
Aang. Ozai then jumps, spins in the air, and slams his fist downward,
creating a circular wave of flame that spreads toward Aang. Aang jumps
over the attack and them slams his hands and feet into the stone pillar
below him. He earthbends a piece of the pillar he is holding on to into
the air. Aang rotates it around and then kicks the chunk of rock at Ozai,
who leaps away using his firebending. In mid air, Ozai propels himself at
Aang using a jet of fire underneath his foot. At the same time, Aang jumps
towards Ozai, performing a spinning kick and sending a wave of fire at
him. Ozai then kicks forward and shoots a fireblast from his foot. The two
attacks collide in a fiery explosion. The camera pulls back through the
broken window of the airship cabin Sokka, Suki, and Toph are in.)

Sokka: Go, Aang! Airbending slice! (swings his hand down)
Suki: Shouldn’t we be helping him‌
Sokka: The Fire Lord is Aang’s fight. We need to stay focused on stopping
that fleet from burning down the Earth Kingdom.
Toph: And how do we do that, Captain Boomerang‌ I can’t see outside of
this floating hunk of metal.
Sokka: (smiles as he comes up with an idea and turns around) Airship
slice!

on platforms jutting out towards the front. In unison, they thrust their
palms towards the ground and unleash comet powered torrents of flame
downward. Cut to a shot from below as the fire blasts hit the earth. Cut
to a shot high above the airships. The fire burns the ground below,
creating an immense amount of smoke. Cut to a shot of the forest as it is
engulfed in flames in an instant. Cut to a shot of the torrents of flame
from the side, and then cut to a shot from behind Toph, looking down at
the chaos through the cabin’s shattered window.

Toph: Whoa. That’s a lot of fire, isn’t it‌

(Cut to a close up of Toph’s face, then cut to a shot of the airship as it
fly towards the camera. Cut to a shot of inside the cabin, Sokka at the
wheel. He spins it back around as their airship comes to face the side of
the airship fleet. He pulls more levers, steadying the ship. Cut to a

Sokka: It’s going to be a rough ride. We need to get to the top of this
thing, fast.

(Sokka grabs Toph’s hand and they run to the exit, Suki following. Sokka
and Suki stop at the doorway as Toph continues on.)

Suki: Then what‌
Sokka: Watch each other’s backs and if we make it that far, I’ll let you
know.

(Sokka and Suki share a quick kiss before going on. Cut to a shot of the
airship as he begins to descend and then proceeds to plough into the other
airships, one after the other, causing them to crash. Cut to a shot from
above as Toph, Suki, and Sokka climb their way up the ladder to the top of
the airship. The floor beneath is demolished just as Sokka grabs the
ladder. Cut to a shot of the top of the airship as the three of them climb
out through a hatch on top. Sokka grabs Toph’s hand and they all begin
running to the front of the airship. The camera quickly zooms out to show
the airship as it continues to fly through the fleet, slowly destroying
itself in the process. Cut to a shot from the side of Sokka, Toph, and
Suki. Just as they near the end, part of the front of the airship splits,
separating Suki from Sokka and Toph. Cut to a shot of Suki as she reaches
out to the others and falls away from the camera. Cut to a shot of Sokka
and Toph as their piece of the airship pulls away.)

Sokka: Suki!

(Cut to a shot of the airship from above. The nose of the airship breaks
away from the rest of it as it rams into one last enemy airship. Cut to a
shot from behind Sokka, reaching out to Suki in front of him. Suki jumps
off the crumbling airship and onto another one.)

Suki: I’m okay! Just finish the mission!
Sokka: No…
Toph: Sokka, I think we’ve gotta…
Sokka &amp; Toph: Jump!

(Cut to a shot of the nose of the airship slamming into the side of an
enemy airship. Cut to a shot from below as Sokka and Toph fall downwards.
They land on the airship below, stumbling forward. Sokka quickly covers
Toph with his body to shield her from the falling debris.

The scene cuts to the ceremonial plaza at the palace where the Fire Lord
is coroneted, ducts of waters streaming on both sides of the area. Cut to
a shot from the front of Azula kneeling at the top of the plaza steps,
wearing the Fire Lord robes and with her armour underneath. Behind her are
several fire sages. The leader of the sages holds the Fire Lord diadem
above Azula’s head.)

Fire Sage: By decree of Phoenix King Ozai, I now crown you Fire Lord…

(The sage pauses as he looks up. Azula turns her head to him.)

Azula: What are you waiting for‌ Do it!

(Appa is heard growling from off screen and Azula turns her head back
around. Cut to a shot of Appa descending and landing in plaza’s courtyard.
Cut to a shot of Appa from the front. Katara is seated in Appa’s saddle
and Zuko stands on Appa’s back.)

Zuko: Sorry, but you’re not going to become Fire Lord today. (jumps off
Appa) I am.
Azula: (laughs) You’re hilarious.
Katara: (standing beside Zuko) And you’re going down.

(The fire sage motions to crown Azula, but she raises her hand, signalling
him to stop.)

Azula: Wait. You want to be Fire Lord‌ Fine. Let’s settle this. Just you
and me, brother. The showdown that was always meant to be. Agni Kai!
Zuko: You’re on.

(Katara turns to Zuko, surprised. Cut to a close up of Azula’s lips as the
curls into a smile. Cut back to Katara and Zuko.)

Katara: What are you doing‌ She’s playing you. She knows she can’t take us
both so she is trying to separate us.
Zuko: I know. But I can take her this time.
Katara: But even you admitted to your Uncle that you would need help
facing Azula.
Zuko: There’s something off about her, I can’t explain it but she’s
slipping. And this way, no one else has to get hurt.

(Fade to a shot of the courtyard from the side. The camera pans from Zuko
kneeling on the right end to Azula kneeling on the left end. Cut to a shot
of Zuko rising and turning around, then cut to a shot of Azula rising.
Each can be seen behind the other. Cut to a shot of Azula from the front
turning and removing the Fire Lord robes.)

Azula: I’m sorry it has to end this way, brother.
Zuko: (in his stance) No, you’re not.

(Azula smiles and assumes a more awkward stance. She then spins and
thrusts her palm out, shooting a blast of blue flame at Zuko. Zuko brings
his hands up, jumps forward, and brings his arms down in front of him,
bending two waves of flame in each hand that come together and shoot
forward. Cut to a wide shot from the side as the blue and orange flames
collide into a wall of fire. As the flames dissipate, Azula leaps forward
on a jet of fire and kicks forward, shooting a blast of fire. She performs
three spinning kicks, sending out a wave of fire towards the camera each
time.

The scene cuts to an overhead shot of the field of stone pillars. Aang
lands on top of one, then leaps away just before blocking and being pushed
back by a blast of fire from Ozai. He follows up his attack with a stream
of fire from a downward kick. Aang lands on a rock and deflects the
attack. Aang lifts a small boulder from the rock and kicks it at Ozai.
Ozai dodges the attack and counters by shooting a blast of fire with a
kick. Aang leaps to the top of another rock to avoid the fire, and then
leaps to the side of a nearby waterfall. Ozai lands on the rock Aang had
leaped to and kicks another fire blast at Aang. Aang uses his water
bending to re-direct the waterfall at Ozai, extinguishing the fire blast
and causing Ozai to jump away. Ozai flies toward Aang and shoots a wide
burst of flame at him, but Aang jumps away to the top of the waterfall.
Ozai rockets up after Aang, flips forward, and shoots a fire blast from
both feet. Aang jumps down the other side of the rocky slope to evade the
flames.

As Ozai flies over, Aang lands on a boulder and lifts it into the air as
he jumps away again, stopping Ozai for just a moment before he continues
to chase after Aang and shoot a stream of fire at him from his fist. Aang
spins his body around, creating a small tornado around himself that
deflects the fire, and then lands on the side of a rock pillar. Aang
slides around to the other side of it as Ozai lands on a rock and shoots
another stream of fire. Aang leaps from the side of the pillar to the side
of another. He uses his airbending to boost himself back at the first
pillar and kicks the entire top half of the stone pillar at Ozai. However,
Ozai flies around to the other side and shoots a concentrated ball of
fire, catching Aang by surprise.

Aang raises his hand and blocks the attack, the fire flowing past his
body. He is pushed back and hits the side of one of the rocks, grunting in
pain and falling down to a ledge. Ozai flies at Aang and lands nearby on
the same ledge. Aang picks himself up and flattens his back and arms
against the rock before pulling away from it and using earthbending to
create stone armour around his body. Ozai thrusts both fists at Aang and
shoots a strong stream of flame, walking toward Aang and pushes him around
the ledge with the attack. Ozai stops and swings his arm at Aang to hit
him with a fire blast, but Aang leaps away, shedding the stone armour.

Aang flips backwards in mid air and shoots a blast of wind at Ozai. Ozai
jumps to the side to avoid it, and in mid air begins to charge lightning.
As he lands on top of a rock, Ozai shoots the lighting at Aang. Aang,
clinging to the side of a rock, looks on with fear, but before the
lightning hits, he swings his arm around to the side, creating a tornado
around his body. He evades the lightning and flies around to the top of
the rock. Ozai fires another lightning bolt at Aang, but misses. Ozai
chases after Aang and continues to shoot lightning. Aang lifts the top of
a rock into the air to shield him then dodges the next bolt. Aang jumps to
a rock and rolls forward just as Ozai fires one more lightning bolt at
Aang.

With not time to dodge, Aang lifts his finger to the lightning and absorbs
it, grimacing in pain. Aang lets the lightning flow through his body and
to his other hand. He points at Ozai, who stares back with fear. However,
Aang hesitates, and instead of re-directing the lightning at Ozai, he
points into the sky and lets the lightning shoot out harmlessly. Aang
falls to the ground, exhausted from the strain. Ozai smiles, spins around,
and kicks a blast of fire at Aang. Aang quickly raises a stone wall in
front of his to block the attack, but the fire blasts through. Aang is
blown off the rock and plummets down to the shallow water below. The
camera zooms in on his eye as he opens it and realizes what is happening.

Aang tilts himself upright and frantically waves his arms upward. Just as
he is about to hit the water, Aang manages to bend the water up so that it
catches him and softens the impact. A large wave is created as the water
falls down, and Aang is carried with it. Aang stands up and looks upward,
and the camera tilts up to show Ozai flying down at him. Cut to a close up
of Ozai rocketing forward.

The scene cuts to an overhead shot of the Fire Nation capital within the
crater. Enormous blue and orange flames can be seen being flung in the
right side of the city. All that can be heard is sombre music and the
sound of blasts of fire. Cut to a sot from within the capital. One
building is on fire. As a blue fire blast shoots past the camera, another
catches on fire. Cut to a shot of Zuko as he punches forwards, releasing a
powerful stream of fire. It collides with a stream of blue fire from
Azula, and both attacks push against each other for a moment before
slipping to one side. Cut to a shot from Zuko’s side as he continues his
blast of fire while keeping enormous blue flames on his other side at bay,
slowly sliding backward. Cut to a close up of his foot as he slides back.
Zuko pivots his foot so as to strengthen his stance and keep himself
steady. Cut to a shot of Zuko from the front, fire streaming from the end
of his fist.

Both Azula and Zuko stop their attacks. Azula looks back at the plaza
behind her, which has caught on fire from Zuko’s attack. She turns back to
Zuko. Angry and scared, she charges forward and leaps upward on a blast of
fire, which she swings down at Zuko. Just before the attack hits, Zuko
spins his body in a circle and thrusts his palms out to the sides,
creating a wall of flame that splits the blue fire in half.

Cut to an overhead shot of the flames dying down, and then cut to a
panning left shot from behind Azula, crouching on the ground. Cut to a
profile shot of Azula, scared and panting heavily. She grits her teeth and
narrows her eyes in determination. Cut to a close up of Zuko’s left fist.
The camera pulls back and rotates around to Zuko’s left as he opens his
fist. Zuko punches forward with his other fist, and two immense fireballs
are launched at Azula, spiralling and intertwining to create one massive
fireball. Cut to a close up of Azula’s eyes, wide with fear and tinted
orange from the approaching blast. The camera quickly zooms out as Azula
dodges to the right on a jet of blue fire, just narrowly avoiding the
fireball.

Azula thrusts herself forward while in the air, rocketing over the ground
on jets of fire from her hands and feet. Cut to a shot of Azula from the
side as she punches forward twice, launching two huge blue fire blasts.
Zuko places his hands near the ground and shoots a blast of fire,
thrusting himself into the air and avoiding one of Azula’s attacks. Zuko
spins around in mid air and swings his heel downward, which creates an arc
of flame that blocks the second fire blast. As Zuko falls back down, he
swings his arms down, creating a blast of fire that destroys a third blue
blast of fire.

Cut to a shot of Zuko crouching, his arms extended forward and blue and
orange flames surrounding him. Cut to a shot of Azula flying forward over
the ground. She banks to the right, avoiding Zuko’s last fire blast. Cut
to an overhead shot as Azula shoots a blast of fire at Zuko and begins to
circle him, followed behind by an enormous trail of blue fire left from
the streams of fire propelling her. Zuko defends himself by creating a
large sphere of fire around him. He then tries to attack Azula with blasts
of fire as she circles him, but she is too fast. Cut to a closer shot of
Zuko. He stops shooting fire blasts at Azula, crouches on the ground, and
performs several spinning sweep kicks, creating a powerful ring of fire
that expands outward. Cut to a shot of Azula flying forward. She tries to
stop herself and attempts to block Zuko’s attack with a shield of blue
fire, but she is too late and it connects.

Azula falls forward and rolls across the ground due to her own momentum,
gasping in pain. Azula picks herself up, breathing heavily. Cut to a close
up of Azula, hunched over. Her hair has come undone, and she stares at the
camera with anger and contempt, baring her teeth.)

Zuko: No lightning, today‌ What’s the matter‌ Afraid I’ll re-direct it‌

(Zuko enters a stance and thrusts his palm forward to emphasize his words.
Katara runs on screen some distance behind him.)

Azula: Oh, I’LL SHOW YOU LIGHTNING!

(Azula proceeds to wave her fingertips around in arcs to generate the
lightning, but her motions are far more dramatic and irregular than usual.
Cut to a shot of Zuko from the front. He breathes in and out deeply as
enters his stance and extends his palms out to receive the lightning. At
the same time, the camera pans to the side to show Katara standing behind
Zuko. The scenery flickers as Azula’s lightning charges. Cut to Azula as
she finishes her motions and poises herself. Cut to a close up of Azula’s
eyes as he glances to her left. Cut to the shot of Zuko and Katara. The
camera zooms in and focuses on Katara. Cut back to Azula, still poised to
strike. She smirks briefly and then extends her arm and finger tip to the
left of Zuko, releasing the lighting at Katara.

The frame rate slows to a crawl as the lightning shoots from Azula’s
finger. Cut to a close up of Zuko. An expression of shock spreads over his
face as he turns to his right. Cut to a shot of Zuko’s legs as he runs to
the right, trying to get in between Katara and the lightning as it shoots
from Azula in the background. Cut to a close up of Katara’s face and zoom
in on her eyes as they reflect the approaching lightning. Cut to a shot
from in front of Katara as Zuko leaps between her and the lightning.)

Zuko: (slow motion) No!

(Zuko extends his finger out and absorbs the lightning mid leap. There is
a blinding flash of light before cutting to a from behind Katara as the
camera pans left to show Zuko in mid air, absorbing the lightning coming
from Azula, electricity surrounding the area. Cut to Katara’s front and
zooms in on her as she watches with shock. The frame rate speeds back up
to normal when we cut to a shot of Zuko hitting the ground, letting the
lightning escape from his other arm. Cut to a shot of the top of the
crater that holds the Fire Nation capital. The enormous bolt of redirected
lightning erupts into the sky above, lighting up the entire crater. Cut to
an overhead shot of Zuko lying on the ground, twitching as electricity
surges through his body. He groans as he rolls onto his back, holding his
chest. Cut to Katara, frightened, as she begins to run towards Zuko.)

Katara: Zuko!

(Cut to a close up of a grimacing Zuko from the side. The clothing around
his chest has been burned away by the lightning, and a scar has been left
on his skin. Katara can be seen running toward Zuko, but she is stopped by
another lightning bolt that strikes the ground between them. Cut to a shot
of Azula, hunched over and swaying from side to side. She begins to laugh
maniacally, and then she rushes at the camera just before the scene cuts
to a shot of Ozai flying downward.

Cut to a shot from the side as Ozai straightens the angle of his flight
and rockets over the water below, leaving behind a wake. Cut to a shot of
Aang looking scared. He turns away and begins swinging his arms in circles
as he uses waterbending to propel himself over the water and towards the
shore. Cut to an overhead shot of Aang reaching the shore. Cut to a shot
of Aang stumbling forward and falling, with Ozai closing in behind him.
Just as Ozai reaches Aang, Aang swings his arms around and earthbends a
small, thick sphere of rocks around himself. Ozai hovers just over Aang.
He laughs as we cut to a shot of Aang within the cramped space, frightened
and bracing himself.)

Ozai: You’re weak! Just like the rest of your people. They did not deserve
to exist in this world, in my world. Prepare to join them. Prepare to die!

(The camera tilts up and shifts to the exterior of the rock ball as Ozai
approaches it. He lifts both arms up and leans back before smashing both
fists into the ball, releasing a powerful blast of fire on impact. Cut to
Aang inside the rock ball. He closes his eyes as small pebbles fall around
him and the stone cocoon shakes, trying to keep it intact. Orange light
can be seen between the individual rocks. The camera cuts to an overhead
shot of Ozai and the rock ball as the fire of his attack blasts downward
and then rises up in a bright orange cloud. Ozai jumps several feet back.
Cut to a shot from behind as Ozai lands. Cut to a close up of Ozai rising
up to the camera’s level. The camera quickly zooms out as Ozai charges
forward and thrusts both fists at the camera, releasing a blast of fire
just before the screen goes black.)

苏进的彗星 第三部分
激斗炼狱

605
00:47:37,198 --&gt; 00:47:40,596
祖寇，别担心，咱们能对付的了阿祖拉

606
00:47:40,596 --&gt; 00:47:43,428
我担心的不是她，我担心的是安昂

607
00:47:43,428 --&gt; 00:47:46,741
要是他没有勇气除掉我的父皇该怎么办？

608
00:47:46,741 --&gt; 00:47:49,072
要是他失败了该怎么办？

609
00:47:49,072 --&gt; 00:47:51,941
安昂不会输的，他一定会安然归来

610
00:47:51,941 --&gt; 00:47:54,761
他必须回来

611
00:48:13,802 --&gt; 00:48:15,779
我手上的是什么啊？

612
00:48:15,779 --&gt; 00:48:19,008
是樱桃核，公主殿下

613
00:48:19,008 --&gt; 00:48:21,481
没错，那今天又是什么日子啊？

614
00:48:21,481 --&gt; 00:48:23,414
是您登基的大日子

615
00:48:23,414 --&gt; 00:48:25,161
哦，可不是嘛

616
00:48:25,208 --&gt; 00:48:28,600
明知今天是我的大日子

617
00:48:28,600 --&gt; 00:48:31,478
为啥还敢留个樱桃核在这些樱桃里

618
00:48:31,510 --&gt; 00:48:35,505
我不是故意的，是我无心犯的一个小错误

619
00:48:35,505 --&gt; 00:48:37,945
小错误？如果我没及时发现这个樱桃核，

620
00:48:37,945 --&gt; 00:48:40,000
你知道会发生什么吗？

621
00:48:40,188 --&gt; 00:48:43,295
我想... 可能会被噎到的？

622
00:48:43,295 --&gt; 00:48:46,781
没错，知道自己犯的是怎样的滔天大罪了吧

623
00:48:47,432 --&gt; 00:48:50,958
我知错了，公主殿下，请您恕罪

624
00:48:51,220 --&gt; 00:48:55,687
好吧，看在今天是吉日的份上，那就饶你一命吧

625
00:48:56,373 --&gt; 00:48:59,540
你被放逐了，立即生效

626
00:49:01,256 --&gt; 00:49:05,762
你们都傻愣着干嘛？我的脚还没洗干净呢

627
00:49:05,762 --&gt; 00:49:07,903
脚趾缝之间也给我清理干净了

628
00:49:07,903 --&gt; 00:49:12,069
我可不想带着一双脏脚去参加加冕仪式

629
00:49:16,323 --&gt; 00:49:20,345
说来奇怪，这彗星看起来确实很美啊

630
00:49:20,345 --&gt; 00:49:23,819
真糟啊，烈火王却要用它毁掉这个世界

631
00:49:48,951 --&gt; 00:49:52,182
我们太迟了，气艇舰队已经起飞了

632
00:49:52,182 --&gt; 00:49:54,367
那咱们也跟着“起飞”吧

633
00:49:54,367 --&gt; 00:49:57,054
-离咱们最近的飞船在哪？ -就在...

634
00:50:36,000 --&gt; 00:50:39,471
公主殿下，您召唤我们有何吩咐？

635
00:50:39,471 --&gt; 00:50:41,600
事实上现在什么都不正常

636
00:50:41,600 --&gt; 00:50:43,872
知道你们到这儿用了多长时间吗？

637
00:50:43,872 --&gt; 00:50:45,883
呃，也就几分钟吧

638
00:50:45,883 --&gt; 00:50:47,588
准确的说是五分钟

639
00:50:47,588 --&gt; 00:50:52,718
五分钟足够让刺客闯进来对付我，并逃之夭夭了

640
00:50:52,718 --&gt; 00:50:54,257
对不起，公主殿下

641
00:50:54,257 --&gt; 00:50:58,102
你们就打算这样效忠你们的新烈火王的吗？

642
00:50:58,102 --&gt; 00:51:00,566
戴笠永远也不会背叛您的

643
00:51:00,566 --&gt; 00:51:05,311
以前你们也是这样忽悠冷风的吧，还不是转而投奔了我

644
00:51:06,194 --&gt; 00:51:07,932
你们全部被放逐了

645
00:51:08,164 --&gt; 00:51:09,980
-可是...    -再见

646
00:51:15,600 --&gt; 00:51:18,366
出去的时候叫下一组人进来

647
00:52:13,000 --&gt; 00:52:14,888
看见没，就应该这样打

648
00:52:14,888 --&gt; 00:52:19,035
做的好，拓芙，该是占领这艘飞船的时候了，掌好舵...

649
00:52:19,035 --&gt; 00:52:22,973
还真是好主意呢，让个盲丫头来掌控巨型飞船

650
00:52:22,973 --&gt; 00:52:24,699
我是在跟苏琪说呢

651
00:52:24,699 --&gt; 00:52:27,282
这还差不多

652
00:52:27,282 --&gt; 00:52:29,200
其他的船员咱们该怎样处置？

653
00:52:29,200 --&gt; 00:52:32,355
将气艇开到水面附近，我有主意了

654
00:52:36,452 --&gt; 00:52:40,149
船员们，注意了啊，我是舰长

655
00:52:40,251 --&gt; 00:52:46,388
大家请立刻到弹药仓享用烤饼和甜奶油

656
00:52:46,388 --&gt; 00:52:49,659
我们有个特别的生日要庆祝

657
00:52:59,187 --&gt; 00:53:03,417
嘿，我是 李逵德，通讯兵

658
00:53:03,417 --&gt; 00:53:06,442
嘿，啊，我在引擎室工作

659
00:53:06,442 --&gt; 00:53:08,571
我说咱们之前怎么没见过呢

660
00:53:08,571 --&gt; 00:53:10,669
咱们的气艇实在是太大了

661
00:53:10,814 --&gt; 00:53:14,579
-谁说不是呢   -知道是谁的生日吗？
（好像是Mike配的，呵呵）

662
00:53:14,579 --&gt; 00:53:18,421
真没想到舰长居然会记得我的生日

663
00:53:18,421 --&gt; 00:53:20,206
他真的很关心下属啊

664
00:53:28,644 --&gt; 00:53:30,286
生日快乐哈

665
00:53:34,738 --&gt; 00:53:37,937
烈火王欧宰，我们来了

666
00:53:51,664 --&gt; 00:53:54,123
阿祖拉，你做的事我们都听说了

667
00:53:54,123 --&gt; 00:53:56,368
你为什么把你所有的下人都放逐了

668
00:53:56,368 --&gt; 00:54:00,715
就连戴笠和御用御火师也都赶走了

669
00:54:00,715 --&gt; 00:54:03,188
我可没办法信任他们

670
00:54:03,188 --&gt; 00:54:07,028
他们迟早都会背叛我，就像梅和泰丽一样

671
00:54:07,028 --&gt; 00:54:11,140
阿祖拉，请您谨慎言行

672
00:54:11,962 --&gt; 00:54:15,375
是父皇派你们来找我的，对吧？

673
00:54:15,958 --&gt; 00:54:18,729
他肯定认为我不配当烈火王

674
00:54:18,729 --&gt; 00:54:22,723
但是我一定会成为火宗史上最强的烈火王的

675
00:54:22,723 --&gt; 00:54:26,701
您一定会的，不过鉴于您今天的所作所为

676
00:54:26,701 --&gt; 00:54:29,993
应该推迟您的加冕大典

677
00:54:30,176 --&gt; 00:54:32,650
什么？刚才那句是谁说的？

678
00:54:34,583 --&gt; 00:54:38,363
真可惜啊，看来只有这么办了

679
00:54:38,363 --&gt; 00:54:42,774
你们两个单挑吧，我命令你们在烈火祭上决斗

680
00:54:42,774 --&gt; 00:54:45,998
可是，我们不是御火师啊

681
00:54:45,998 --&gt; 00:54:50,957
哦，那这样吧，“茉” 你被放逐了，“莉”你留下

682
00:54:51,575 --&gt; 00:54:54,346
可我是“莉”啊，到底谁被放逐了？

683
00:55:08,145 --&gt; 00:55:12,212
永固城，白莲教前来搭救

684
00:55:12,212 --&gt; 00:55:14,364
我们这就还你自由

685
00:55:14,364 --&gt; 00:55:20,933
御火师时隔百年才能体会到如此强大的力量

686
00:56:54,079 --&gt; 00:56:57,473
好吧，头发，你就自认倒霉吧

687
00:57:00,756 --&gt; 00:57:04,847
多可惜啊，你的头发曾经那么的秀美

688
00:57:04,847 --&gt; 00:57:07,220
你来这儿干嘛？

689
00:57:07,220 --&gt; 00:57:10,477
我可不想错过自己女儿的加冕大典

690
00:57:10,477 --&gt; 00:57:14,418
别装的你好像多爱我似的，我知道你对我的看法

691
00:57:14,418 --&gt; 00:57:15,699
你认为我是个怪物

692
00:57:15,699 --&gt; 00:57:17,992
我想你一定很困惑

693
00:57:17,992 --&gt; 00:57:21,057
你一直用恐惧来控制你的子民

694
00:57:21,057 --&gt; 00:57:23,508
梅和泰丽就是很好的例子

695
00:57:23,508 --&gt; 00:57:26,983
我哪有什么选择，只有傻子才相信信任

696
00:57:27,003 --&gt; 00:57:28,933
恐惧是唯一可靠的方法

697
00:57:29,064 --&gt; 00:57:31,382
就连你也怕我

698
00:57:31,382 --&gt; 00:57:34,884
不，我爱你，阿祖拉

699
00:57:34,884 --&gt; 00:57:36,339
我真的爱你

700
00:58:04,464 --&gt; 00:58:07,375
看来我们没办法及时赶上了

701
00:58:07,375 --&gt; 00:58:08,733
糟了

702
00:58:40,552 --&gt; 00:58:43,322
模模，你该走了

703
00:59:43,299 --&gt; 00:59:44,871
这是怎么了？

704
00:59:44,871 --&gt; 00:59:47,564
是安昂，他回来了

705
01:00:00,965 --&gt; 01:00:04,601
几代烈火王都没能找到你，

706
01:00:04,601 --&gt; 01:00:11,618
现在让我遇见你真的是天意啊

707
01:00:12,023 --&gt; 01:00:15,175
听我说，你我的这场决斗并没有必要

708
01:00:15,175 --&gt; 01:00:18,271
你有能力能阻止这场战争，停手吧

709
01:00:18,370 --&gt; 01:00:22,199
你说的没错，我的确有这个能力

710
01:00:22,199 --&gt; 01:00:26,979
天下的能力都集中在我的身上

711
01:00:47,434 --&gt; 01:00:49,859
加油啊，安昂，让他尝尝“御气斩”

712
01:00:49,859 --&gt; 01:00:51,721
我们不去帮帮他吗？

713
01:00:51,721 --&gt; 01:00:54,222
解决烈火王是安昂的责任

714
01:00:54,222 --&gt; 01:00:57,878
我们要阻止这些战舰烧毁土强国

715
01:00:57,878 --&gt; 01:01:00,159
我们该怎么做啊，“飞去来”船长

716
01:01:00,171 --&gt; 01:01:02,818
这个金属大家伙浮在空中，我什么也看不到

717
01:01:03,398 --&gt; 01:01:05,517
那咱们就来招“气艇斩”

718
01:01:41,533 --&gt; 01:01:45,050
地上已成一片火海了， 对吧？

719
01:02:06,135 --&gt; 01:02:10,034
这里不安全了，咱们赶快上到气艇顶部去

720
01:02:12,861 --&gt; 01:02:13,996
接下来该怎么办

721
01:02:13,996 --&gt; 01:02:17,838
不要走散了，事情有变的话，我会再想办法的

722
01:02:49,834 --&gt; 01:02:51,234
苏琪！

723
01:02:54,061 --&gt; 01:02:57,109
我没事，接下来就靠你了

724
01:02:57,109 --&gt; 01:03:00,802
索卡，我想咱们该...  跳！

725
01:03:12,971 --&gt; 01:03:16,019
尊凤凰大帝谕旨

726
01:03:16,019 --&gt; 01:03:19,247
现在加冕你为烈火王...

727
01:03:19,320 --&gt; 01:03:22,077
还等什么呢，赶紧的啊

728
01:03:26,911 --&gt; 01:03:30,238
抱歉了，今天不会让你成为烈火王的

729
01:03:31,840 --&gt; 01:03:33,440
登基的人将会是我

730
01:03:35,023 --&gt; 01:03:36,579
少说笑了

731
01:03:36,579 --&gt; 01:03:38,503
你这回完了

732
01:03:39,935 --&gt; 01:03:44,583
你想成为烈火王？好吧，今天咱们就一决高下

733
01:03:44,583 --&gt; 01:03:46,215
只有我和你，皇兄，

734
01:03:46,215 --&gt; 01:03:50,276
咱们在烈火祭上单挑吧，这不是你一直想要的吗？

735
01:03:50,889 --&gt; 01:03:52,590
我接受挑战

736
01:03:54,590 --&gt; 01:03:56,148
你这是要干嘛？

737
01:03:56,148 --&gt; 01:03:58,867
她在使诈，她知道自己寡不敌众

738
01:03:58,867 --&gt; 01:04:00,310
她想把咱俩逐个击破

739
01:04:00,675 --&gt; 01:04:03,177
我知道，不过今天我一定能赢她

740
01:04:03,177 --&gt; 01:04:06,815
你曾答应过皇叔不会孤军作战的

741
01:04:06,815 --&gt; 01:04:08,432
她今天有点怪怪的，

742
01:04:08,432 --&gt; 01:04:10,717
虽然我不知道她怎么会变成这样，不过她气数已尽

743
01:04:10,717 --&gt; 01:04:13,591
与她单挑就不会伤及无辜了

744
01:04:25,418 --&gt; 01:04:28,691
对不起啊，皇兄，今天我赢定了

745
01:04:28,691 --&gt; 01:04:30,557
不，你赢不了的

746
01:08:00,957 --&gt; 01:08:03,343
今天不打算使用闪电了吗？怎么了？

747
01:08:03,343 --&gt; 01:08:05,351
害怕我以其人之道还其人之身吗？

748
01:08:05,351 --&gt; 01:08:08,187
哦，要闪电吗，那我就放一个给你尝尝

749
01:08:30,369 --&gt; 01:08:32,465
不！

750
01:08:46,123 --&gt; 01:08:47,709
祖寇！

751
01:09:06,224 --&gt; 01:09:09,715
你这个懦夫，就像你的子民一样

752
01:09:09,715 --&gt; 01:09:13,629
他们不配生存在我的世界里

753
01:09:13,629 --&gt; 01:09:18,364
和他们一起准备受死吧
Prepare to join them. Prepare to die!
