Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse

Written By: Aaron Ehasz
Directed By: Joaquim Dos Santos
Storyboard By: Joaquim Dos Santos, Ian Graham, Lauren Montgomery, Kenji
Ono, Sang Jin Kim
Animation By: Moi Animation
Transcribers: Icy_Ashford and Psycho Silver

Act I

(The episode opens with a shot of the sun with the moon just beginning to
overlap it. Cut to a shot of the submarines at the water, guarded by Hue
and six other warriors. The camera tilts up to the plaza. Destroyed,
smoking tanks are strewn about. Cut to an overhead shot of the plaza. Fire
Nation tanks and soldiers are shooting fire blasts at the caterpillar
tanks, which have formed a semi circle against the plaza wall. Cut to a
close up of the caterpillar tanks. The sides flip open and earthbender lob
stones at the firebenders. Cut to a shot of a Fire Nation soldier
signaling the catapults to fire. The projectiles fly through the air as
the earthbenders’ stones and shockwaves destroy the catapults.

Cut to a shot of and zoom in on Sokka, Bato, and an earthbender examining
a map on the ground from behind the tanks. Behind them, Toph shoots a rock
through the side of the tank just before a fireball collides with into the
tank. Sokka winces at the loud explosion. Sokka looks up and sees Katara
helping Hakoda through the plaza’s large doorways. He is holding his side,
still wounded.)

Sokka: Dad! You’re on your feet again.

(Sokka and Toph run towards Katara and Hakoda. Katara lets Hakoda sit
down.)

Hakoda: Thanks to your sister. I’m in no shape to fight but maybe there is
someway I could help.
Sokka: Everything’s going smoothly and the eclipse hasn’t even kicked in
yet.
Hakoda: Let’s hope our luck holds out. Katara, you seem distracted. Is
something wrong‌

(Katara takes a few steps forward and looks out in the distance.)

Katara: Yeah… Is that… is that Aang‌
Sokka: What‌

(Aang can be seen gliding towards them, dodging the numerous fireballs. He
lands in front of his friends.)

Sokka: Please tell you’re here because the Fire Lord turned out to be a
big wimp and you didn’t even need the eclipse to take him down‌
Aang: He wasn’t home. No one was. The entire palace city is abandoned.

(Cut to a close up of Sokka’s profile. The camera rotates around to his
front as he comes to a realization.)

Sokka: They knew.
Aang: It’s over. The Fire Lord is probably long gone. Far away on some
remote island where he’ll be safe during the eclipse.
Sokka: No. My instincts tell me he wouldn’t go too far. He would have a
secret bunker. Somewhere he could go so it’ll be safe during a siege but
still be close enough to lead his nation.
Toph: If it’s an underground secret bunker we’re looking for, I’m just the
girl to find it.

(Sokka pulls out a small device resembling a pocket watch. It ticks, and
there is a dial and notches on one section of it.)

Sokka: The Mechanist gave me this timing device. It looks like we’ve got
about 10 minutes until the full eclipse. 10 minutes to find the Fire Lord.

Aang: We can still do this. We can still win the day.
Katara: Wait. If they knew we were coming, it could all be a trap. Maybe
we should use the time we have left to make sure all of us get out of here
safely.
Hakoda: Everyone who’s here today came prepared to risk everything for
this mission. They know what’s at stake. If there’s still a chance and
there’s still hope, I think they would want Aang to go for it.
Sokka: What do you think‌ You’re the one who has to face the Fire Lord.
Whatever you decide, I’m with you.

(Aang stands up and faces toward the battlefield.)

Aang: I’ve got to try.

(The camera zooms out and the scene fades to a shot of Appa flying towards
the top of the volcano where the Fire Nation capital is. He lands on the
side, and Aang, Sokka, and Toph jump off him.)

Aang: Do you feel anything down there‌
Toph: (her hand to the ground) Yep. There are natural tunnels
criss-crossing through the inside of the volcano.
Sokka: Anything else‌ Is there a structure somewhere‌
Toph: (she extends her hands to each side before plunging them into the
ground, gripping the earth with her fingers) There’s something big, dense,
and made of metal deep in the heart of the volcano.
Sokka: Sounds like a secret bunker to me.

(Toph thrusts her hands forward, bending a hole into the side of the
volcano. Momo chirps and curiously sticks his head out from behind the
headpiece on Appa’s armor.)

Aang: Stay safe. We’ll be back soon.

(Toph, Sokka, and Aang enter though the hole into a dark tunnel. Toph
kneels down and feels the ground before running down one side of the
tunnel. Sokka and Aang quickly follow.)

Toph: This way! That one’s a dead end.
Sokka: What would we do without you‌
Toph: Perish and burn in hot magma.

(They crawl past a small stream of lava and Sokka flinches away from it.)

Sokka: Yeah, pretty much.

(The three of them come to a cavern filled with active lava vents all over
the floor.)

Toph: The tunnel continues on the other side and it leads right to the
bunker.
Sokka: We’ll have to be fast but careful.

(Sokka attempts to run across, but is immediately stopped by one of the
vents erupting. He yells in surprise and shields himself as Aang swings
his staff at it, bending a gust of wind and cooling down the lava.)

Aang: How was that careful‌
Sokka: I was wrong. We need to be fast, careful and lucky.

(Toph, Aang, and Sokka run across the cavern, carefully dodging the steam
and lava coming from the vents. Cut to a shot of the three from the front,
covered in a red glow. They all stop and look dismayed. The camera quickly
zooms out to reveal them standing on a small cliff above a large river of
lava.)

Sokka: There’s no floor! It’s just a river of lava.

(Aang spins his staff and extends the glider wings.)

Aang: Climb aboard and hold on tight.

(Cut to a shot of Sokka and Toph holding on to the top of Aang’s glider as
he glides through the lava tunnel, screaming with fright. Aang banks left
and right, avoiding a stone column and a lava explosion. They all make it
to the other side and land easily before continuing on foot. Cut to an
overhead shot of the cavern floor. The camera zooms out and tilts up to
show Aang, Toph, and Sokka running up to a large metal bunker built
against the cavern wall.)

Sokka: That’s some door!

(Toph walks up to the door, places her ear against it, and knocks on it,
producing a metallic thud.)

Toph: Not a problem.

(Toph takes a step back before bashing her elbows into the door,
fracturing and denting it. She takes another step back, kisses her middle
and index fingers, and forcefully stabs them through the middle of the
door. Toph kicks a hole through the metal. Cut to a shot of the other side
of the door as Toph’s leg bursts through. She widens the opening and steps
through. With sound effect added, Toph points in a direction and takes
off, followed by Aang and Sokka.)

Sokka: I am so glad we added you to the group.

(Cut to an overhead shot of the Fire Nation capital. The camera tilts down
to the invasion force making their way up the path towards the top. Cut to
an overhead shot of three caterpillar tanks and a legion of soldiers
moving up the path while fireballs are flung at them. Cut to a shot of a
Fire Nation battlement from below as a firebender throws fireballs from
it. The camera zooms out to show the fireball hitting the metal shields
that the earthbenders are carrying over their heads. The Boulder and the
Hippo run towards the Cliffside under the battlement, slap their hands
against it, and earthbend an avalanche, demolishing the battlement. The
same is done to another battlement. Cut to a shot of one of the Fire
Nation commanding officers. The camera rotates around him as he turns
around and looks at the sky. The moon is slowly starting to move over the
sun.)

Fire Nation Fighter #1: Retreat! Everyone move to secondary defensive
position! Retreat!

(The battlement behind him tips over and falls over. Three firebenders
retreat as three caterpillar tanks draw close to them. Cut to a shot of
Bato hanging on the back of one of the tanks, addressing the other
soldiers.)

Bato: The eclipse is only minutes away. We should be able to make it up
the hill by the time it starts and secure the entire palace by the time
it’s finished!

(The soldiers all give a hearty battle cry. Cut to Katara holding Hakoda
over her shoulder.)

Katara: We can wait here if you want.
Hakoda: No. I want to press forward with the others.

(Katara and Hakoda continue forward. Cut to a shot of the rafters inside
the Fire Nation bunker. The camera tilts down to War Minister Qin walking
down a tunnel. The camera zooms out to show Aang, Sokka, and Toph running
down a tunnel on the other side that merges with the first one. Qin
whistles a tune just as he comes to the end of the wall and the three kids
run past him. He gasps in shock, alerting the three to his presence. The
turn around and brandish their weapons at him, Toph stomping the ground
and popping a rocking into the air. Qin presses his back against the wall
and raises his hands in surrender.)

War Minister Qin: The Fire Lord’s chamber is that way down the hall to the
left and up the stairs. You can’t miss it.

(Aang, Sokka, and Toph all step in closer to him. Cut to a shot from just
above Qin’s head of Aang and Sokka glaring up at him.)

Aang: (suddenly smiles cheerfully) Thanks.

(They leave Qin, Sokka giving him one last dirty look. Once their gone,
Qin breathes a sigh of relief, looks left and right to make sure no one
saw anything, composes himself and continues walking and whistling as if
nothing happened. Cut to a shot of the tunnel floor’s level as Aang,
Sokka, and Toph run past. Sokka pulls out the Mechanist’s device and
checks their time.)

Sokka: Only 30 seconds until the total eclipse.

(Cut to a shot of the three coming to another large door with a flame
symbol on the front and at the top. Aang takes a deep breath and closes
his eyes. Cut to a close up of Aang.)

Aang: I’m ready. I’m ready to face the Fire Lord.

(The camera zooms out just as Aang spins his staff up and forward. Cut to
a shot of the other side of the door as it is blown off its hinges by
Aang’s blast of air. The camera zooms way out to show that the room is one
large hall supported by thick metal beams on both sides, lit by
torchlight. There is a single throne at the end of the hall. Cut to a shot
from the front of the hall as Aang, Sokka, and Toph run inside. Azula is
lounging on the throne.

Azula: So, you are alive after all.

(Cut to a shot of Aang in utter, speechless shock. Zoom out to show all
three of them. Sokka is as shocked as Aang. Cut to a shot of the bottom of
the throne and tilt up towards Azula.)

Azula: I had a hunch that you survived. It doesn’t matter, I’ve known
about the invasion for months.

(Cut to a profile shot of Aang, still shocked, before the scene cuts to a
shot of Zuko from behind, standing in front of a much smaller door within
the tunnels. He has his broadswords slung on his back. Cut to a shot of
him from a low angle.)

Zuko: I’m ready to face you.

(Cut to a shot of the other side of the door and zoom out as Zuko slides
it open. There are elite guards with spears standing at the front. Cut to
a shot of Fire Lord Ozai. He is just about to take a sip from a steaming
cup of tea when he notices Zuko.)

Fire Lord Ozai: Prince Zuko, what are you doing here‌

(Cut to a shot from behind Ozai and zoom out. Zuko walks towards the line
of guards. Cut to commercial.)

Act II

(The show returns with a shot of the moon passing over the sun, covering
almost all of it. Cut to a far, overhead shot of the invasion force on the
side of the volcano. The camera shifts over to focus of the capital in the
crater. Shift to a close shot of water tribe warriors marching up the
volcano. A tank passes by on the other side. The Mechanist walks on screen
and looks back.)

The Mechanist: The eclipse is starting. Put on your eclipse glasses.

(The Mechanist takes off his monocle and places a visor with thin slits
over his eyes. The warriors stop marching for a moment and do the same
before continuing on. Cut to a shot of Katara and Hakoda with their
eclipse glasses on as they look towards the sun. Cut to a shot of the
eclipse as the moon completely blacks out the sun. The scene cuts to Zuko
standing in front of Ozai and his guards.)

Fire Lord Ozai: Why are you here‌
Zuko: I’m here to tell the truth.
Fire Lord Ozai: Telling the truth during the middle of an eclipse. This
should be interesting.

(Ozai waves his hand and his guards leave through doors on both sides of
the chamber.)

Zuko: First of all, in Ba Sing Se, it was Azula who took down the Avatar,
not me.
Fire Lord Ozai: Why would she lie to me about that‌
Zuko: Because the Avatar is not dead. He survived.
Fire Lord Ozai: (alarmed) What‌!
Zuko: In fact, he probably is leading this invasion. He could be on us
right now.
Fire Lord Ozai: (stands up and points, furious) Get out! Get out of my
sight right now if you know what’s good for you.
Zuko: That’s another thing. I’m not taking orders from you anymore.
Fire Lord Ozai: (seething with rage) You will obey me or this defiant
breathe will be your last!

(Ozai begins to walk towards Zuko, until Zuko unsheathes his broadswords
and brandishes them at him.)

Zuko: Think again! I am going to speak my mind and you are going to
listen.

(Cut to a close up of Ozai as he sits back down before the scene cuts to a
shot of Aang, Toph, and Sokka, ready to fight.)

Aang: Where is he‌ Where is the Fire Lord‌
Azula: (sarcastically) Hm, you mean I’m not good enough for you‌ You’re
hurting my feelings.
Sokka: (brandishes his sword) Stop wasting our time and give us the
information. You’re powerless right now so you’re in no position to
refuse.
Toph: And stick to the truth. I’ll be able to tell if you’re lying.
Azula: Are you sure‌ I’m a pretty good liar. (her face becomes completely
expressionless) I am a 400 foot tall purple platypus bear with pink horns
and silver wings
Toph: (after a brief pause) Okay you’re good, I admit it. (bends the earth
underneath Azula so that it encases her is a conical shape) But you really
ought to consider telling the truth anyway.

(Azula gives a small smirk. The camera zooms out from her as the stone
trap shatters. Sokka, Aang, and Toph are all shocked. Azula keeps smirking
as she brushes some rubble off her shoulder.)

Azula: When I left Ba Sing Se, I brought home some souvenirs. (two Dai Li
agents drop from the ceiling and land in front of her) Dai Li agents.

(Aang swings his staff at them, throwing out a blast of wind. The Dai Li
both bend a stone wall in front and completely nullify the attack. The
scene cuts to the invasion force making its way to the edge of the crater.
The camera tilts up towards the Fire Nation royal palace. Cut to a shot of
Bato standing at the edge. Warriors and two tanks make their way past him
and over the edge.)

Bato: Surround the periphery! We have to secure the palace by the time the
eclipse is over. Otherwise, we’ll be in for the fight of our lives.

(Bato makes his way down with the rest of them. The tanks and soldiers
reach the edge of the capital and make their way in. Cut to a shot of a
group of firebenders lining themselves up in one of the alleys. Haru,
Tyro, and a group of earthbenders come to face them.)

Tyro: Stop! Surrender peacefully and we won’t harm you.
Fire Nation Fighter #2: We’ll never surrender. (he steps forward, makes
flailing movements with his arms, dashes forward and thrusts his palm
forward as if to shoot a fire ball, but all that is produced is a pathetic
fizzle) Er okay, we surrender.

(He and the other firebenders bow down and present their hands in
surrender. Shift to Katara and Hakoda climbing up to the edge of the
crater, looking down at the Fire Nation capital as the soldiers and tanks
head to the palace.)

Hakoda: There it is. The Fire Nation royal palace. We’ve come so far.
Katara: It’s not over yet.

(Both begin to head down. The scene cuts to Zuko and Ozai in the bunker.)

Zuko: For so long, all I wanted was you to love me, to accept me. I
thought it was my honor that I wanted but really, I was just trying to
please you. You, my father, who banished me just for talking out of turn.
(points a sword at Ozai) My father, who challenged me; a 13-year-old boy
to an Agni Kai. How can you possibly justify a duel with a child‌
Fire Lord Ozai: It was to teach you respect.
Zuko: It was cruel! And it was wrong.
Fire Lord Ozai: Then you have learned nothing.
Zuko: No, I’ve learnt everything! And I had to learn it on my own. Growing
up, we were taught that the Fire Nation was the greatest civilization in
history and somehow, the war was our way of sharing our greatness with the
rest of the world. What an amazing lie that was. The people of the world
are terrified by the Fire Nation! They don’t see our greatness, they hate
us! And we deserve it. We’ve created an era of fear in the world. And if
we don’t want the world to destroy itself, we need to replace it with an
era of peace and kindness.
Fire Lord Ozai: (laughs mocking) Your Uncle has gotten to you, hasn’t he‌
Zuko: (closes his eyes for a second) Yes. He has.

(Zuko smiles. Ozai can only frown in disapproval. The scene cuts to a
stone wall just as it explodes and reveals Aang, Sokka, and Toph running
towards the camera. A stone structure erupts from the floor where Aang is
standing, but he jumps away from it and jumps off one of the metal beams
and flips forward. The two Dai Li agents pull two slabs from the ground
and fling them at Aang, but he deflects them with two kicks. The camera
zooms out just as Toph bursts through the stone behind Aang, creating a
hole in it. She lands between the agents and bends two diagonal pillars of
stone up from beneath them as she lands, pushing them towards the walls.
The agents both land of the walls feet first and both bend a pillar of
stone down at Toph, who blocks the attacks by bending two stone walls up
from the floor.

Toph thrusts her hands forwards and bends a stream of earth at Azula. Cut
to a shot of the stream from the side as it makes contact with Azula. The
scene goes into slow motion and cuts to a shot of Azula’s foot as the
stream of earth pushes her up into the air. The scene comes back to normal
speed to a shot of Azula back flipping off the attack and flying back
towards the throne. Cut to a close up of Azula smirking as she lands.

Cut to Aang as he runs forward. Cut to a shot from behind one of the Dai
Li’s back as he watches Aang and runs to the side. Cut to a close up of
Aang from the side as he’s running. He turns and stops when he hears a
loud, grinding sound. Cut to a shot of the Dai Li agent sliding over the
side of the wall and past Aang. He flings himself off the wall and in
front of Aang with a pillar of earth, putting himself in front of Azula.
The agent sinks into the floor as he lands and bends a large, diagonal
wall of stone of from the floor. Aang jumps high into the air, flips
forward, and bursts through the wall feet first. Cut to a shot from the
side as Aang lands behind the Dai Li agent, popping him into the air as he
lands with one small pillar of stone and knocking him away with a larger
one, knocking the agent out of the fight. Aang spins his staff above his
head, letting go of it as he turns forward, winds up, and shoots a
powerful blast of air with one hand at Azula.

Cut to a closer shot of Azula as she grabs on to the arms of the throne
and cartwheels away just before the throne is completely destroyed by the
air blast. Aang dashes to where Azula was and swings his staff as her,
bending out a blade of air. Cut to a shot of Azula running between two
metal beams. She jumps over the blade of air and at the beam, then flips
off that one back towards the beam behind her. Cut to a close up of Azula
landing on the side of the beam just before spring off it as another blade
of air barely misses her.

Cut to a shot of Azula barrel rolling and doing the splits as she lands on
the ground. There is a brief close up of Azula just before she runs off,
Aang chasing after. Cut to an overhead shot of Azula running behind the
metal beams. She jumps onto and jumps off a beam just as Aang sends
another blade of air at her. Azula continues running forward and hopping
from the wall to the beams and up to one of the stone beams the Dai Li
agents had attacked Toph with. Aang does a small pole vault with his staff
and kicks a blast of air at Azula, but misses. Cut to a shot of Azula
sliding down the stone beam. She jumps off the diagonal wall Toph had
created to block the attack earlier and lands on the other one before
flipping off of it and landing on the floor.

Cut to a close up of Azula as she turns and faces Aang. Aang and Toph run
at her. Azula turns and runs towards the large stone wall. Cut to a shot
of the other Dai Li agent sliding down the stone beam towards the floor
and Azula. The agents lands behind her and then bends a pillar up from
beneath her, sending Azula into the air towards the hole in the wall that
Toph had made. Cut to a close up of the hole as Sokka climbs up into it.
Cut to a shot from behind Sokka as Azula flies towards him. The scene goes
into slow motion and cut to a close up of Azula passing just inches above
Sokka’s face as he ducks down. She smirks down at him while he looks back
at her fearfully.

The scene comes back to full speed as Azula lands on the other side of the
wall and runs towards the exit. Cut to a shot of Sokka as he tries to
climb back down. He stops and ducks timidly as the Dai Li agent, Toph, and
Aang jump over him and through the hole, one at a time. Sokka drops down
and follows after. Cut to a close up of Toph from the side as she chases
after Azula. Aang catches up to her from the side.)

Aang: I can’t pin her down. She’s too quick.

(Cut to a shot from the front of Aang, Toph, and Sokka running forward.
Toph strafes to the side and off screen. Cut to a shot from inside the
tunnels of Azula running out the doors and towards the camera. The Dai Li
agent slides out of the room and blocks the entrance with a large stone.
The Dai Li agent slides over the ground and after Azula just as Aang
bursts through the stone and continues chasing them. Cut to a shot from
the ground level of Azula and the agent running away from the camera. The
Dai Li agent is knocked to the side by a stone pillar ejecting out of the
side of the wall. A hole opens in the side of the wall and Toph flies out
of it. Cut to a shot of the agent hitting the inside of the groove of one
of the steel beams supporting the tunnel. He tries to attack, but Toph
smashes his stone gloves into dust before grabbing both sides of the
beam’s grooves and pulling them in, trapping the agent.

Cut to a close up of Toph admiring her work. Aang runs past her and she
follows. Cut to a shot of Aang and Toph running down the tunnel and past
the camera. Sokka catches up to them.)

Sokka: Wait! Aang, Toph, stop attacking. (Aang, Toph, and Azula all stop
running) Don’t you see what she’s doing‌ She’s just playing with us. She’s
not even trying to win this fight!
Azula: (sarcastically) Not true, I’m giving it my all.
Toph: You’re trying to keep us here and waste all our time!
Azula: Um, right. I think your friend just said that genius. And since you
can’t see, I should tell you I’m rolling my eyes.
Toph: (angry) I’ll roll your whole head!
Sokka: She’s just baiting you again.
Aang: Okay, so what do we do‌ Just ignore her‌
Sokka: We don’t have a choice. We just have to get out of here and find
the Fire Lord on our own somehow.

(Aang, Sokka, and Toph turn and walk away from Azula.)

Azula: It’s a trap. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

(Aang and Toph stop and turn to Azula for a moment, but Sokka keeps
walking, waving a hand back at her.)

Sokka: (spreading one arm wide over his head in a gesture of dismissal)
Ignore!
Azula: (in a slightly bored tone) So, Sokka’s your name right‌ My favorite
prisoner used to mention you all the time. (Sokka stops and turns around)
She was convinced that you were going to come rescue her. Of course, you
never came and she gave up on you.

(The camera zooms in on Sokka. Tears fill his eyes and he gives a furious
cry of anger as he rushes at Azula. Cut to a close up of Azula as she
smirks smugly.)

Azula: (under her breath, dripping with malice) Come and get it…

(Cut to a shot of Azula’s hand as she slips a deadly, ornate blade from
her sleeve. Cut to a shot of Toph as she senses the deception. The camera
zooms out as she raises her knee, which raises a stone into the air, and
shoots it forward with a thrust of her hands. Cut to a shot of Azula’s
wrist being pinned against the wall by the stone, the blade dropping from
her hand. Azula grunts in pain as she hits the wall. Sokka grabs Azula’s
shoulder, pushes her up again the wall, and glares into her eyes.)

Sokka: Where is Suki‌!

(The scene shifts to a far shot of Zuko and Ozai from the side.)

Zuko: After I leave here today, I’m going to free Uncle Iroh from his
prison and I’m going to beg for his forgiveness. He is the one who has
been a real father to me.
Fire Lord Ozai: (chuckles sarcastically) That’s just beautiful. Maybe he
can pass down to you the ways of tea and failure.
Zuko: But I’ve come to an even more important decision. (pauses) I’m going
to join the Avatar. And I’m going to help him defeat you.
Fire Lord Ozai: (grinning slyly) Really‌ Since you’re a full blown traitor
now and you want me gone, why wait‌ I’m powerless, you’ve got your swords,
why don’t you just do it now‌
Zuko: Because I know my own destiny. Taking you down is the Avatar’s
destiny. (sheathes his swords) Goodbye.

(Cut to a close up of the right side of Zuko’s face as he walks away. Ozai
can be seen behind him.)

Fire Lord Ozai: (standing) Coward! You think you’re brave enough to face
me but you’ll only do it during an eclipse. If you have any real courage,
you’ll stick around until the Sun comes out. Don’t you want to know what
happened to your Mother‌

(Cut to a shot from behind Zuko as he stops in front of the doors and
turns around. Cut to a close up of Ozai as he grins venomously. Cut to a
shot of the tallest tower of the Fire Nation palace, the eclipse in the
sky, before cutting to commercial.)

Act III

(The episode returns with a close up of the lower edge of the eclipse. Cut
to a shot from behind Zuko as he stands before Ozai.)

Zuko: What happened that night‌
Fire Lord Ozai: My father, Fire Lord Azulon, had commanded me to do the
unthinkable to you, my own son. And I was going to do it. Your Mother had
found out and swore she would protect you at any cost. She knew I wanted
the throne and she proposed a plan. A plan in which I would become Fire
Lord and your life would be spared.

(There is a close up of Zuko’s eyes. Cut to a close up of Sokka.)

Sokka: (angry) Where’s Suki‌ Answer me!

(Cut to a shot from the side of Sokka glaring at Azula, her arms pinned
above her head against the wall.)

Aang: (grabbing Sokka’s shoulder) Sokka, she won’t talk.
Sokka: (hesitates, then turns back to Azula) Where are you keeping her‌!

(Cut to a close up of Azula and zoom in as she smirks silently. Fade to a
shot of Ozai at exactly the same angle.)

Fire Lord Ozai: Your Mother did vicious, treasonous things that night. She
knew the consequences and accepted them. For her treason, she was
banished.
Zuko: (a tear streams from his eye) So she’s alive.
Fire Lord Ozai: Perhaps. Now I realize that banishment is far too merciful
a penalty for treason. Your penalty will be far steeper.

(Fade to the shot of the edge of the eclipse. The moon passes over and the
rays of the sun shine through. Cut to a close up of Ozai’s eye quickly
opening. Cut to a shot of Ozai stepping forward and swinging his arms out,
creating two arcs of electricity from the tips of his fingers. He thrusts
his fingers forward and fires an incredible bolt of lightning at Zuko. Cut
to a shot from the side as Zuko catches the lightning with the tips of his
fingers. Zuko slides backward from the force of the attack, the lightning
surrounding his body and making his hair stand on end. Zuko sinks his body
down and pulls his arms in as the electricity runs through his body, then
thrusts his other hand forward, redirecting the lightning in Ozai’s
direction. Cut to a shot from the side as the bolt strikes the ground
where Ozai is standing, creating an explosion that knocks Ozai against the
wall and the tapestry behind him. Cut to a close up of Ozai as he
straightens up, his hair falling over his face. The camera zooms out as
the tapestry falls down and a fire caused by the explosion burns in front
of Ozai. Cut to a shot from behind Ozai to reveal that Zuko has fled.

Cut to a close up of Azula.)

Azula: Oh. Sounds like the firebending’s back on.

(The camera quickly zooms out as Azula kicks her leg upward and creates an
arc of blue fire, making Sokka jump back in surprise. She thrusts he foot
forward and shoots a fireball at Sokka. He is saved from the attack by
Toph, who jumps in and pushes him out of the way. Azula flips up and
places her feet on the wall. Cut to a close up of Azula straining herself
to break her arms free. She grins as the rock trapping her there explodes
in a blue flame. She springs off the wall towards Aang and flips forward.
Aang jumps out of the way as Azula lands with a fiery heel drop where he
was standing. Aang, Sokka, and Toph all ready themselves for another
attack. Cut to a shot of Azula standing up and turning to them.)

Azula: Dad’s all the way at the end of the hall and down the secret
stairway on the left. I’m sure he’ll be more than happy to see you now.

(Azula quickly runs away down the tunnel.)

Sokka: I fell for it! I used up all our time.
Toph: It’s not your fault, Sokka. Azula was ready for us. She had every
move planned out.
Sokka: (hopeless) And now it’s too late.
Aang: Maybe it’s not too late. The eclipse is over but I can face the Fire
Lord anyway.
Sokka: No. I don’t think that’s a good idea.
Aang: But I’m ready! I came here with a job to do and everyone’s counting
on me.
Toph: The Fire Lord knew we were coming this time. We thought we had
surprise on our side but we didn’t. It just wasn’t our day. What we need
to do now is go help our friends.
Aang: I guess you guys are right.
Sokka: (putting a hand on Aang’s shoulder) You’ll have another chance. I
know you will.

(Cut to an overhead shot of the palace surrounded by the tanks and
warriors. Cut to a shot of Katara laying Hakoda against one of the tanks.
They both take off their eclipse glasses.)

Bato: (off screen) What should we do, Hakoda‌ Shouldn’t something have
happened by now‌
Hakoda: I don’t know. But now that the eclipse is over I expect we’re
going to see some firebenders any minute.

(Cut to a shot of Bato as he suddenly looks up in shock. The camera zooms
out to show Katara turning to look in the same direction. Cut to a shot of
the palace and zoom out as five Fire Nation war balloons ascend into the
air. Cut to a closer shot of the balloons from the side, showing
firebenders powering them.)

The Mechanist: (off screen) My own invention. Oh this is terrible!

(Teo silently places a consoling hand on his father’s shoulder. Cut to a
shot of one of the war balloons. Behind it ascends an enormous zeppelin.
Cut to a shot from ground level as everyone stares up at the five war
balloons along with five huge zeppelins decorated with dragon motifs. Cut
to a shot of Bato, Katara, and Hakoda. Katara turns and points into the
sky.)

Katara: They’re back!

(Katara runs forward. Cut to a shot of Appa, carrying Aang, Sokka, and
Toph, flying towards the camera. Cut to a shot from behind Aang’s head as
he looks up at the war balloons. Cut to a close of Aang from the front,
his expression worried. Cut to a panning right shot of the side of one of
the zeppelins. Cut to a shot of Appa landing and Katara running up to him.
Cut to a shot of Aang looking down at Katara uneasily. The camera turns to
Sokka, Toph, and Momo in Appa’s saddle.)

Sokka: It was all a trap. Azula knew we were coming and she’s plotted out
every move. (he and Toph jump down from Appa) We just got to get to the
beach as fast as we can. If we can make it to the submarines, maybe we can
get away safely.
Aang: (off screen) They’ve got air power, but so do I! (opens his glider)
I’m going to do what I can to slow them down.

(Aang throws his glider into the air. He catches onto it and flies into
the air as it loops back to him. Appa growls. Katara climbs on him.)

Katara: Appa, you and I can help too.

(Cut to Aang flying towards the zeppelins in the distance, Appa and Katara
follow behind. Cut to Sokka, Toph, Hakoda, and Bato.)

Sokka: Everyone, let’s get back to the subs!

(They all turn and follow Sokka. Cut to a shot from the front of Aang
gliding, Appa and Katara behind him. The camera follows him as he glides
past the camera and towards the small war balloons. Cut to a shot of a
firebender shooting two fireballs at Aang, who banks and rolls to avoid
the attack. He then throws his glider forward, closes it, grabs the end of
it, and pierces straight through the fabric of the balloon. Air leaks from
the war balloon and it goes down as Aang glides on towards the zeppelins.
Cut to a shot of Katara in Appa’s saddle from behind her. The camera
focuses in on an approaching war balloon. Katara stands up and bends the
water out from her flasks. With a swift rotation of her arms and body,
Katara makes a clean, horizontal cut through the balloon. She and Appa fly
past the camera, and after a brief moment, the top of the war balloon
flutters away and the bottom part drops.

Cut to a shot of Appa, Katara, and Aang flying up towards the zeppelins.
The camera tilts upward as countless fireballs are shot of them. Cut to a
shot of Aang, Appa, and Katara flying towards the camera. A few fireballs
hit Appa and he growls in discomfort, but his armor protects him. Appa
tries to fly in close, but is driven back by the force of the fire blasts.
Cut to a shot from behind of firebenders standing on small platforms under
the body of a zeppelin. They are in harnesses attached to supports above
them. The shoot fire blasts at Appa as he flies right past them. Cut to a
shot of Katara creating a shield of water to block the oncoming fireballs.
Aang glides on screen in the background.)

Katara: We can’t keep them all back. They’re too many of them!
Aang: Let’s join the others.

(Aang barely dodges another fireball. Cut to a shot of Aang and Appa
flying over the capital and back towards the ocean. The scene shifts to a
shot of the top of the Fire Nation prison. The camera tilts down to the
entrance. There are multiple craters in the stone wall and stairs. Zuko
runs in from behind the camera and towards the door. Cut to a shot inside
the prison of a guard lying on the floor. He looks up, and then winces as
Zuko runs past him. Zuko runs down the hall and towards a doorway. Cut to
a shot looking through the doorway as Zuko runs to it.)

Zuko: Uncle!

(Cut to a shot from behind Zuko and zoom in on the interior of the cell.
There is a huge hole in the cage, and the surrounding bars are bents
outward. Warden Poon is lying on the floor, dazed. Zuko runs in and grabs
Poon by the collar.)

Zuko: Where is my Uncle‌
Warden Poon: (shocked and awed) He’s gone. He busted himself out. I… I’ve
never seen anything like it! He was like a one man army!

(Zuko lets go of Poon and exits. Cut to Sokka running down the slope
towards the plaza, the others following behind. He stops and looks up. The
camera pans up to the zeppelins high in the air, slowing making their way
towards them. Cut to a shot of the bottom of one of the zeppelins. Bomb
bay doors open up. Cut to Sokka as Aang, Appa, and Katara land behind
him.)

Sokka: Try and find cover! I think we’re about to see some bombs.

(Everyone huddles together as Toph bends a large slab of stone above them.
Cut to a shot looking up at the zeppelins as large red, cylinder shaped
bombs drop from them. Cut to a shot from the inside of the bomb bay
looking down as the bombs hit the ground and explode. Cut to a shot of the
bombs impacting the stone shields protecting the invasion forces. The
camera tilts down to the group Toph is protecting. The slab cracks and
begins to fall, but Toph bends two stone supports up from the ground to
keep it standing. Cut to a shot of the caterpillar tanks quickly making
their way down the slope as bombs go off all around them. Cut to the
interior of one of the tanks as The Boulder, The Hippo, and other
earthbenders are knocked off balance by the explosions. Cut to a shot
above the zeppelins as they pass over, ceasing the raid. Cut to a shot of
Sokka, Aang, Toph, and Katara coming out from under the stone and looking
up at the zeppelins as they fly towards the beach.)

Katara: Why aren’t they turning around to attack us again‌
Aang: They’re headed for the beach. They’re going to destroy the
submarines!
Sokka: How are we all going to escape‌
Hakoda: We’re not.
Sokka: Then our only choice is to stand and fight. We have the Avatar, we
could still win!
Hakoda: Yes, with the Avatar we could still win on another day. You kids
have to leave. You have to escape on Appa together.
Katara: What‌ We can’t leave you behind. We won’t leave anyone behind.
Hakoda: You’re our only chance in a long run. You and Sokka have to go
with Aang somewhere safe. It’s the only way to keep hope alive.
Bato: The youngest of our group should go with you. The adults will stay
behind and surrender. We’ll be prisoners but we’ll all survive this
battle.
Tyro: I’ve got some experience with the Fire Nation prisons. It’s not
going to be easy but we’ll get by.
Sokka: They’re at the beach already!

(Cut to a shot of the plaza ground. The camera tilts up to the submarines
and the swamp benders as the shadow of a zeppelin passes over. Cut to a
shot from ground level looking up at the seaweed creature created by Hue.
The zeppelins fly overhead and begin to drop more bombs. Due and Tho bend
water from the ocean, swinging their arms in windmill motions to send the
water into the air and intercept the bombs. The bombs explode in midair.
Hue grabs two oncoming bombs with his seaweed arms. He tosses one away,
but the other explodes, destroying the arm of the seaweed creature.
Another bomb lodges itself inside the body of the creature and explodes,
destroying it. The seaweed falls on top of Due and Tho. Hue, Due, and Tho
stick their heads out from the pile of steaming seaweed. Cut to a shot
from the side of the bombs falling on the submarines. One by one they
explode and are destroyed. A bomb falls in front of the camera and
explodes. The smoke clears and we see a shot of the destroyed submarines
from above. The camera pans left as they burn away. Cut to Aang and his
friends as the look on with despair. The camera pans to Sokka, who shuts
his eyes and grudgingly accepts the turn of events.

Cut to a shot of Appa’s saddle. Toph and The Mechanist, who is carrying
Teo, rise up to Appa&#x27;s back on a platform of stone that Toph is bending.
Toph hops in the saddle and The Mechanist places Teo down in it, hugging
him in goodbye.)

The Mechanist: Bye, son.
Teo: (sadly) Bye, Dad. I’m really proud of you.

(Toph lowers The Mechanist back to the ground. He takes one last look at
Teo. Cut to a shot of The Duke trying to climb onto Appa’s head. Pipsqueak
helps him up.)

The Duke: I’ll miss you, Pipsqueak.
Pipsqueak: Take care, The Duke.

(Cut to Haru and Tyro hugging each other goodbye. The duke can be seen
climbing up Appa in the background.)

Haru: I’ll be back for you Dad.
Tyro: If we don’t escape on our own first.

(Haru puts his fist into his hand and bows respectfully to his father. Cut
to Sokka, Hakoda, and Katara.)

Hakoda: We lost today but we’ve never been this close. We tasted victory
and that counts for something.
Katara: We’ll miss you Dad.

(Katara, Sokka, and Hakoda have one last group hug.)

Sokka: Bye Dad. We won’t be apart for too long this time. I promise.

(Cut to a shot of Aang from behind. He’s on his knees on top of Appa’s
head, with Momo sitting next to him. Katara walks up to him and places a
hand on his shoulder. Cut to a close up of Aang to show him crying. He
glances at Katara, who smiles at him. He looks away and wipes his eyes
before standing up and addressing the rest of the invasion force.)

Aang: Thank you all for being so brave and so strong. I’m going to make
this up to you.

(Katara jumps into the saddle and Aang sits down. Momo climbs on to Aang’s
shoulder and Appa takes off. Cut to a shot of Aang’s back as Appa flies
away from the camera and into the distance. Katara and Sokka both look
back. Cut to an overhead shot of the adults and zoom out as they stare
upward. Cut to a shot of Appa in the distance. One of the zeppelins slowly
flies on screen between Appa and the camera. Cut to a shot of the inside
of the zeppelins gondola. The captain and Azula watch Appa fly away
through a window.)

Captain: Should we follow them, Princess‌
Azula: No. They’re too fast. It doesn’t matter, they’ll be back.

(The camera zooms in on Azula before cutting to a shot of Aang and the
other on Appa from the front. They look back at the zeppelin as they fly
away. Aang turns back to the front.)

Aang: I know just the place for us to go where we’ll be safe for a while.
The Western Air Temple.

(Appa flies forward. Cut to a shot of Appa flying far into the distant
clouds. A single Fire Nation war balloon flies on screen from below,
following them. Cut to a shot of Zuko in the balloon’s basket, holding on
to the ropes and staring off at Appa. The camera zooms in on him. Fade to
white.)

黑日反攻 下部
日食

16
00:01:46,442 --&gt; 00:01:47,512
老爸

17
00:01:48,895 --&gt; 00:01:50,385
你能站起来了

18
00:01:50,701 --&gt; 00:01:52,352
多亏了你妹妹

19
00:01:52,352 --&gt; 00:01:55,873
虽然我不能打了，不过一定有我能帮的上忙的

20
00:01:55,887 --&gt; 00:01:59,029
一切进展顺利，日食还没有开始

21
00:01:59,029 --&gt; 00:02:00,998
希望咱们好运常在

22
00:02:01,787 --&gt; 00:02:05,277
卡塔拉，你看起来有点心不在焉，怎么了？

23
00:02:05,277 --&gt; 00:02:08,662
是啊，那个...那是安昂吗？

24
00:02:09,133 --&gt; 00:02:10,277
什么？

25
00:02:13,141 --&gt; 00:02:16,149
该不是那个烈火王太面了，

26
00:02:16,149 --&gt; 00:02:18,366
没等日食开始你就已经把他给收拾了吧？

27
00:02:18,366 --&gt; 00:02:21,039
他不在那儿，连个鬼影子都没有

28
00:02:21,039 --&gt; 00:02:23,884
整座皇宫都被废弃了

29
00:02:24,695 --&gt; 00:02:26,539
咱们的计划败露了

30
00:02:26,539 --&gt; 00:02:29,849
完了，烈火王可能已经远走高飞了

31
00:02:29,849 --&gt; 00:02:33,449
没准正在某个渺无人烟的小岛躲避日食呢

32
00:02:33,536 --&gt; 00:02:37,061
不，我的直觉告诉我，他肯定没有走远

33
00:02:37,158 --&gt; 00:02:38,343
他没准有个秘密的军火库

34
00:02:38,343 --&gt; 00:02:42,997
在那里他既安全又可以掌控他的军队

35
00:02:43,127 --&gt; 00:02:47,615
要找地下的军火库有啥难度，就交给我吧

36
00:02:47,615 --&gt; 00:02:49,488
机械师给了我这个计时装置

37
00:02:49,488 --&gt; 00:02:54,307
距日食还有10分钟
我们必须在10分钟内找到烈火王

38
00:02:54,387 --&gt; 00:02:57,873
我们能办得到的，今天我们仍然能够取得胜利

39
00:02:57,873 --&gt; 00:03:00,923
且慢，如果他们知道我们要来的话
那可能会是个陷阱

40
00:03:00,923 --&gt; 00:03:05,245
也许我们应该利用仅剩的时间
确保大家安全的离开

41
00:03:05,245 --&gt; 00:03:09,989
今天来参战的各位同胞，都深知这次任务的危险性

42
00:03:09,989 --&gt; 00:03:14,141
他们会冒这个险的，如果有一线希望的话

43
00:03:14,141 --&gt; 00:03:16,729
他们肯定希望安昂能够放手一搏

44
00:03:16,729 --&gt; 00:03:19,978
你怎么想？毕竟与烈火王决一生死的是你

45
00:03:19,978 --&gt; 00:03:22,241
不管你做什么决定，我们都一定支持你

46
00:03:24,780 --&gt; 00:03:27,124
我要试一下

47
00:03:33,073 --&gt; 00:03:35,119
感觉到下面有什么东西了没？

48
00:03:35,119 --&gt; 00:03:39,568
感觉到了，在火山内部的确有一条蜿蜒的自然隧道

49
00:03:39,568 --&gt; 00:03:41,982
还有什么吗？四周有什么建筑物吗？

50
00:03:43,844 --&gt; 00:03:49,265
在火山中心有一个巨大厚实的金属建筑

51
00:03:49,265 --&gt; 00:03:50,972
要我说，那肯定就是秘密军火库了

52
00:03:55,264 --&gt; 00:03:57,508
老实待着，我们一会儿就回来

53
00:03:59,745 --&gt; 00:04:03,248
-这边走，那边是死胡同  -真不知没有你我们该怎么办？

54
00:04:03,300 --&gt; 00:04:06,757
-被熔岩烧成灰了呗    -嗯，差不多

55
00:04:10,105 --&gt; 00:04:13,894
这隧道向另一端延伸，尽头就是军火库

56
00:04:13,894 --&gt; 00:04:16,313
咱们最好快点通过，还得加点小心

57
00:04:17,383 --&gt; 00:04:18,434
-你这也叫小心啊

58
00:04:18,434 --&gt; 00:04:22,426
-我错了，除了速度快，小心之外还得有点小运气

59
00:04:28,853 --&gt; 00:04:32,306
居然连个落脚地都没有了，只有一条熔岩河

60
00:04:32,306 --&gt; 00:04:34,902
爬上来，大家都抓紧了

61
00:04:49,770 --&gt; 00:04:51,939
这门要怎样才能弄开啊

62
00:04:55,682 --&gt; 00:04:57,331
小菜一碟

63
00:05:07,667 --&gt; 00:05:10,806
让你入伙真是太明智了

64
00:05:33,000 --&gt; 00:05:38,275
撤退，大家都撤往第二道防线，撤退！

65
00:05:41,258 --&gt; 00:05:43,235
再过几分钟就要日食了

66
00:05:43,235 --&gt; 00:05:46,914
我们必须在日食开始之前爬上山坡

67
00:05:46,914 --&gt; 00:05:50,783
并在日食结束之前拿下整个皇宫

68
00:05:53,695 --&gt; 00:05:55,588
不行咱们就在这儿等吧

69
00:05:55,588 --&gt; 00:05:59,086
没事，我想与大家共进退

70
00:06:09,379 --&gt; 00:06:14,046
烈火王的密室就在大厅下面
左转上楼就是，你们不会错过的

71
00:06:14,271 --&gt; 00:06:15,503
谢了

72
00:06:26,469 --&gt; 00:06:29,279
距完全日食还有30秒钟

73
00:06:34,881 --&gt; 00:06:38,651
我准备好了，让我面对烈火王吧

74
00:06:42,949 --&gt; 00:06:46,146
看来，你真的还活着

75
00:06:47,600 --&gt; 00:06:49,226
我就知道你死不了

76
00:06:49,226 --&gt; 00:06:53,295
没关系，反正这次入侵我几个月前就知道了

77
00:06:58,212 --&gt; 00:07:01,321
我已经准备好来面对你了

78
00:07:04,740 --&gt; 00:07:07,900
祖寇，你来这儿干嘛？

79
00:07:22,179 --&gt; 00:07:27,079
日食开始了，大家都戴上日食镜

80
00:07:39,552 --&gt; 00:07:43,732
-你来这儿干嘛？ -我来这儿是想告诉您真相

81
00:07:43,732 --&gt; 00:07:49,602
挑日食这个节骨眼来告诉我真相，那就说来听听吧

82
00:07:55,001 --&gt; 00:07:59,993
首先，在永固城撂倒神通的是阿祖拉，不是我

83
00:07:59,993 --&gt; 00:08:05,699
-她干嘛要撒谎？-因为神通还没死，他还活着

84
00:08:05,699 --&gt; 00:08:09,393
-什么？  -事实上，这场入侵可能就是他在领导

85
00:08:09,393 --&gt; 00:08:11,182
他随时都会找我们来算帐

86
00:08:11,182 --&gt; 00:08:14,662
滚！识相的就赶快从我的眼前消失

87
00:08:14,723 --&gt; 00:08:18,521
我正要跟您说这事呢
从今以后我不会再听从您的命令了

88
00:08:18,521 --&gt; 00:08:24,331
你最好服从我，否则今天我就结果了你！

89
00:08:25,703 --&gt; 00:08:30,987
请您三思，反正我要
说出我的想法，您不听也得听

90
00:08:33,174 --&gt; 00:08:35,811
他在哪儿？烈火王在哪儿？

91
00:08:35,811 --&gt; 00:08:40,446
嗯，你是说我不配跟你打吗，我好伤心啊

92
00:08:40,446 --&gt; 00:08:43,671
别浪费我们的时间，老实交待

93
00:08:43,671 --&gt; 00:08:46,750
你现在毫无缚鸡之力，没有资格跟我们讨价还价

94
00:08:46,841 --&gt; 00:08:50,506
最好说实话，我可是能看出来你是否在说谎

95
00:08:50,506 --&gt; 00:08:54,075
真的吗？说谎我可很在行啦

96
00:08:54,075 --&gt; 00:08:59,912
我是个400英尺高的长着粉红色角
银色的翅膀的鸭嘴熊

97
00:08:59,912 --&gt; 00:09:03,039
好吧，算你恨，我得承认

98
00:09:05,542 --&gt; 00:09:08,564
不过你最好讲实话，否则我拆了你的骨头

99
00:09:15,339 --&gt; 00:09:19,830
我从永固城带了点纪念品回来

100
00:09:20,954 --&gt; 00:09:23,319
戴笠特工

101
00:09:36,500 --&gt; 00:09:41,959
把周边给我围上，咱们得在日食结束前占领皇宫

102
00:09:41,969 --&gt; 00:09:46,006
否则，我们只能以死相拼了

103
00:09:50,562 --&gt; 00:09:54,215
站住，缴械不杀

104
00:09:54,215 --&gt; 00:09:56,673
要我们投降没门

105
00:10:00,500 --&gt; 00:10:02,605
好吧，我们投降

106
00:10:04,782 --&gt; 00:10:09,237
到了，这就是烈火国的皇宫
我们终于来到这里了

107
00:10:09,237 --&gt; 00:10:11,475
还没有结束呢

108
00:10:13,644 --&gt; 00:10:18,163
一直以来，我所期盼的就是您能疼爱我，接受我

109
00:10:18,163 --&gt; 00:10:20,500
我一直认为那就是我想要的荣耀

110
00:10:20,628 --&gt; 00:10:23,507
不过事实上，我只是想取悦您

111
00:10:23,507 --&gt; 00:10:28,490
您，我的亲生父亲，居然因为
一句无忌童言就将我放逐

112
00:10:28,490 --&gt; 00:10:32,949
作为父亲，居然在烈火祭上挑战自己13岁的儿子

113
00:10:32,949 --&gt; 00:10:36,314
您怎么能这么对待自己的亲生骨肉？

114
00:10:36,314 --&gt; 00:10:38,063
我那是要教你学会尊重

115
00:10:38,115 --&gt; 00:10:40,801
您那么做太残酷了，真是大错特错

116
00:10:40,801 --&gt; 00:10:44,741
-看来你什么也没学到   -不，我什么都学到了

117
00:10:44,741 --&gt; 00:10:46,936
我不得不自学成才

118
00:10:46,936 --&gt; 00:10:51,830
打小老师就教我们
烈火国是有史以来最文明的国家的

119
00:10:51,921 --&gt; 00:10:56,696
发动战争是为了和全天下共享烈火国的伟大

120
00:10:56,696 --&gt; 00:11:02,501
这真是个弥天大谎
天下黎民都很惧怕烈火国

121
00:11:02,501 --&gt; 00:11:06,810
他们非但不崇敬我们的伟大
反而更加痛恨我们，这是我们自作自受

122
00:11:06,810 --&gt; 00:11:11,758
我们开创了一个满是恐惧的世界
如果不想让世界自己毁灭的话

123
00:11:11,758 --&gt; 00:11:17,175
我们需要创造和平和谐的新纪元取而代之

124
00:11:19,372 --&gt; 00:11:22,186
这都是你的皇叔教给你的，对吧？

125
00:11:23,503 --&gt; 00:11:26,174
没错，是他教的

126
00:12:49,738 --&gt; 00:12:50,969
我逮不住她

127
00:12:50,969 --&gt; 00:12:53,162
她的身法太快了

128
00:13:06,838 --&gt; 00:13:10,142
等等，安昂，拓芙，别追了

129
00:13:10,142 --&gt; 00:13:11,655
没看出来她的意图吗？

130
00:13:11,655 --&gt; 00:13:15,014
她明摆在耍我们玩，她根本就无心恋战

131
00:13:15,328 --&gt; 00:13:17,764
瞎说，我已经全力以赴了

132
00:13:17,945 --&gt; 00:13:20,192
你想把我们困在这儿，浪费我们的时间

133
00:13:20,192 --&gt; 00:13:23,678
嗯，没错，你的那位朋友还真挺聪明的

134
00:13:23,678 --&gt; 00:13:27,606
谁让你啥也看不见呢
我刚才说话的时候可是眼珠乱转呢

135
00:13:28,046 --&gt; 00:13:31,565
-我会把你的头也转下来的    -别上当，那是她的激将法

136
00:13:31,565 --&gt; 00:13:34,665
那我们该怎么做，无视她的存在？

137
00:13:34,665 --&gt; 00:13:39,312
我们别无选择，我们得赶紧从这里出去
看来只能自己去找烈火王了

138
00:13:40,434 --&gt; 00:13:43,245
前面有陷阱啊，别怪我没提醒你们哟

139
00:13:43,245 --&gt; 00:13:44,816
信你才怪

140
00:13:44,816 --&gt; 00:13:51,122
我说，你是叫索卡吧？我最爱的囚犯总是提起你

141
00:13:51,122 --&gt; 00:13:54,147
她坚信你能救她出去，当然啦，

142
00:13:54,147 --&gt; 00:13:57,044
谁让你总也不来呢，她已经彻底对你失望了

143
00:14:00,961 --&gt; 00:14:02,612
放马过来吧

144
00:14:09,313 --&gt; 00:14:12,089
苏琪在哪？

145
00:14:13,554 --&gt; 00:14:17,107
今日离开之后，我要去天牢救出皇叔

146
00:14:17,107 --&gt; 00:14:19,362
我要乞求他的原谅

147
00:14:19,362 --&gt; 00:14:21,644
比起你来，他更像是我的亲生父亲

148
00:14:21,941 --&gt; 00:14:28,008
真是太感人了，也许他能让你
继承他的烂茶叶和失败基因

149
00:14:28,008 --&gt; 00:14:30,176
我还做了一个更重要的决定

150
00:14:30,176 --&gt; 00:14:35,637
我要加入降世神通，我要帮助他战胜你

151
00:14:35,738 --&gt; 00:14:41,730
真的吗？你这个不肖子这么想除掉我，那还等什么？

152
00:14:41,730 --&gt; 00:14:46,903
我现在手无寸铁，而你却有双剑在握
为何不现在就结果我？

153
00:14:47,008 --&gt; 00:14:51,270
因为我知道自己的使命是什么
战胜你是神通的使命

154
00:14:53,550 --&gt; 00:14:54,915
再见

155
00:14:54,915 --&gt; 00:14:59,267
懦夫，在日食之时与我对峙算什么英雄

156
00:14:59,267 --&gt; 00:15:04,272
倘若你真的有种的话，你就等到太阳出来

157
00:15:04,272 --&gt; 00:15:07,625
难道你不想知道你母后到底怎么样了吗？

158
00:15:19,500 --&gt; 00:15:20,644
那晚到底发生了什么？

159
00:15:20,910 --&gt; 00:15:27,281
先皇阿祖龙，命令我废掉你

160
00:15:27,281 --&gt; 00:15:31,535
废掉我的亲生儿子，在我正要动手之时

161
00:15:31,535 --&gt; 00:15:35,447
你母亲发现了，说无论如何也要保全你

162
00:15:35,447 --&gt; 00:15:39,332
她知道我要的是皇位，于是就献了一计

163
00:15:39,332 --&gt; 00:15:45,906
那是个两全其美的计策
我得以称王，而你也保住了小命

164
00:15:45,963 --&gt; 00:15:48,180
苏琪在哪？

165
00:15:48,180 --&gt; 00:15:49,798
回答我！

166
00:15:49,891 --&gt; 00:15:52,346
索卡，她不会说的

167
00:15:53,003 --&gt; 00:15:55,406
你把她关在哪儿了？

168
00:15:55,406 --&gt; 00:16:00,278
你的母后那晚做出了大逆不道的事情

169
00:16:00,278 --&gt; 00:16:03,141
她知道后果是什么，不过她认命了

170
00:16:03,141 --&gt; 00:16:06,439
由于她的叛逆行为，她被放逐了

171
00:16:06,439 --&gt; 00:16:08,331
这么说她还活着

172
00:16:08,331 --&gt; 00:16:15,740
也许吧，现在我意识到用
Perhaps. Now I realize that banishment is far too  merciful  a  penalty  for
treason.

173
00:16:15,740 --&gt; 00:16:19,808
我这回不会对你心慈手软了

174
00:16:40,899 --&gt; 00:16:43,229
看来我的御火术又回来了

175
00:16:52,593 --&gt; 00:16:56,200
沿着大厅走到底，下秘密楼梯
向左就能找到父皇了

176
00:16:56,270 --&gt; 00:16:58,647
我相信他现在一定很高兴见到你们

177
00:16:58,647 --&gt; 00:17:03,024
我搞砸了！我把时间浪费光了

178
00:17:03,024 --&gt; 00:17:06,255
索卡，那不是你的错，阿祖拉早有预谋

179
00:17:06,255 --&gt; 00:17:08,439
她在这等着我们上钩来着

180
00:17:08,439 --&gt; 00:17:10,454
现在一切都太晚了

181
00:17:10,529 --&gt; 00:17:13,771
也许还来得及，日食虽然过去了

182
00:17:13,771 --&gt; 00:17:16,403
我仍然可以去和烈火王单挑

183
00:17:16,403 --&gt; 00:17:18,498
不行，这不是个好主意

184
00:17:18,498 --&gt; 00:17:22,842
但是我已经准备好了
大家都指望着我完成使命呢

185
00:17:22,842 --&gt; 00:17:27,356
这次烈火王知道我们会来
我们原以为可以打他个措手不及

186
00:17:27,356 --&gt; 00:17:29,688
不过未能成功，今日不宜恋战

187
00:17:29,800 --&gt; 00:17:32,011
我们现在应该去协助我们的朋友们

188
00:17:32,011 --&gt; 00:17:34,024
我想你们说得对

189
00:17:34,285 --&gt; 00:17:37,360
你还会有机会的，一定会的

190
00:17:42,335 --&gt; 00:17:45,510
哈库达，咱们该怎么办？
怎么那边一点动静也没有呢？

191
00:17:45,510 --&gt; 00:17:51,913
我不知道，不过现在日食已过
火宗人应该不久就要出现了

192
00:18:00,785 --&gt; 00:18:04,631
那是我的发明啊，天哪，真是太糟了

193
00:18:15,759 --&gt; 00:18:17,388
他们回来了！

194
00:18:31,226 --&gt; 00:18:35,711
那是个陷阱，阿祖拉知道我们会来
她把我们给设计了

195
00:18:36,633 --&gt; 00:18:38,713
我们现在应该尽快赶往海滩

196
00:18:38,713 --&gt; 00:18:41,757
如果我们能回到潜艇上的话，就可以安全离开了

197
00:18:41,757 --&gt; 00:18:45,511
我不会让他们独占制空权的

198
00:18:45,511 --&gt; 00:18:48,478
我会尽量为你们拖延时间的

199
00:18:51,500 --&gt; 00:18:53,702
阿柏，咱俩也去帮忙

200
00:18:56,095 --&gt; 00:18:58,919
大家赶快回到潜艇上去

201
00:19:27,985 --&gt; 00:19:31,291
他们数量太多了，咱们不可能把他们都收拾掉

202
00:19:31,291 --&gt; 00:19:33,307
咱们去和其他人会合吧

203
00:19:44,947 --&gt; 00:19:46,453
皇叔

204
00:19:51,479 --&gt; 00:19:52,931
我皇叔哪去了？

205
00:19:52,931 --&gt; 00:19:56,488
他逃走了，他把自己劫走了

206
00:19:56,488 --&gt; 00:20:01,060
我...我真是见所未见啊！他真是万夫莫敌啊

207
00:20:07,804 --&gt; 00:20:11,652
找好掩护，我想他们就要投炸弹了

208
00:20:30,585 --&gt; 00:20:33,323
他们为什么不乘胜追击呢？

209
00:20:33,323 --&gt; 00:20:36,476
他们朝着海滩去了

210
00:20:36,476 --&gt; 00:20:40,515
-他们要去炸毁潜艇！     -没有潜艇，我们怎么能都全身而退呢？

211
00:20:40,515 --&gt; 00:20:47,568
-我们不逃了。 -那咱们背水一战吧
我们有降世神通在，此战必胜

212
00:20:47,568 --&gt; 00:20:55,400
有神通坐阵，他日我们必当大胜火宗
你们几个孩子骑着阿柏先逃吧

213
00:20:55,482 --&gt; 00:20:59,982
什么？我们不能抛下你不管，我们不能抛弃任何人

214
00:20:59,982 --&gt; 00:21:02,366
留得青山在，不怕没柴烧

215
00:21:02,366 --&gt; 00:21:05,408
你和索卡赶紧随神通一道，找个安全的地方躲一阵

216
00:21:05,408 --&gt; 00:21:07,801
你们是唯一的希望

217
00:21:07,801 --&gt; 00:21:12,797
让那几个年轻人也一起走吧
成年人留下来暂时投降

218
00:21:12,797 --&gt; 00:21:16,913
虽然会入狱，但至少大家都能把命保下来

219
00:21:16,913 --&gt; 00:21:23,239
我之前蹲过火宗的监狱
虽然日子很苦不过会熬过去的

220
00:21:23,239 --&gt; 00:21:25,317
他们已经到达海滩了

221
00:22:05,000 --&gt; 00:22:07,484
-再见了，儿子    -再见了，老爸

222
00:22:07,831 --&gt; 00:22:09,956
我真的为你自豪

223
00:22:13,304 --&gt; 00:22:15,461
我会想你的，矮人

224
00:22:15,461 --&gt; 00:22:17,242
保重啊，公爵

225
00:22:17,242 --&gt; 00:22:23,676
-我们会回来接你们的   -没准我们能成功越狱呢

226
00:22:25,732 --&gt; 00:22:29,113
今天虽然败了，但离胜利只有寸步之遥

227
00:22:29,113 --&gt; 00:22:33,009
我们已经初尝胜利的滋味，这对我们来说意义非凡

228
00:22:33,009 --&gt; 00:22:35,086
老爸，我们会想你的

229
00:22:35,086 --&gt; 00:22:40,611
老爸，再见，我保证，我们不会分离太久的

230
00:22:50,871 --&gt; 00:22:57,190
感谢大家的英勇和坚强，我会补偿大家的

231
00:23:14,004 --&gt; 00:23:15,259
公主，要跟着他们吗？

232
00:23:15,383 --&gt; 00:23:19,966
不了，他们飞得太快
没关系的，他们迟早要回来

233
00:23:23,000 --&gt; 00:23:26,306
我知道有个地方比较安全，可以让咱么避一避

234
00:23:26,402 --&gt; 00:23:28,207

很久以前，这四大国和谐共处

6
00:00:14,212 --&gt; 00:00:18,217
然而，烈火国发起的战争结束了和平

7
00:00:18,640 --&gt; 00:00:22,434
只有同时掌握四种元素的降世神通才能结束战争

8
00:00:22,435 --&gt; 00:00:25,741
然而在大家最需要他的时候，他却消失了

9
00:00:26,117 --&gt; 00:00:29,509
100年后，我和哥哥发现了转世的降世神通

10
00:00:29,883 --&gt; 00:00:31,751
他是个御气师，名叫“安昂”

11
00:00:31,786 --&gt; 00:00:34,159
尽管他的御气术着实了得

12
00:00:34,194 --&gt; 00:00:36,820
在拯救苍生之前，他要学的还有很多

13
00:00:37,819 --&gt; 00:00:40,812
但是我坚信 安昂能拯救这个世界
